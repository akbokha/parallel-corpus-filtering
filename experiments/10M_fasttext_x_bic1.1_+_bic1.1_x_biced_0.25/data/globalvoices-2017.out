although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is exceedingly great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , read American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly known for an American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less reporter who had covered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to face the Supreme Court of Justice who wanted to increase his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the United States had only intensi@@ fied .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had written a very low love story about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the tourism and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops behind the mountain , how to say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and declares publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and approved in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won with the Republican Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominated candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ie person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters to be in accordance with people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alistic program , people from all over the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I managed to talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ um@@ ps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with the present editor of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity which I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me as their son .
it still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues , to acc@@ ust@@ omed us to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me much in my career .
these people and those by them em@@ bodied my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump joins his way to the nominated Republican Presi@@ dential candidate , they sent me a stop and the equivalent to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out to be the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the idea of the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ see these things , nearly broke my heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a c@@ assi@@ sts .
people submit to people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows people that their wor@@ ries and fears about hec@@ tic changes in their communities cannot be taken into consideration .
could it be that these voters , of which most knows are , for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they would perhaps say that they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( ante . ) : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities , &quot; Voc@@ abulary from white into the White and W@@ hi@@ pl@@ ash , what is so much means like ch@@ and@@ el@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it called the great Van Jones , has exactly what America did so great .
millions people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America is always welcome .
for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise and says : to Hell with vers@@ eness , freedom of religion and the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again on the ru@@ d@@ der .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration in Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your United States ? &quot; Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud voice &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the crowd .
&quot; Lat@@ inos have a seat in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your United States ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; if any man , who is not like you , has a place in your United States ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan completed his words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find any more in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played at both locations does not only change the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the apost@@ asy
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists , but worlds away from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the village : a symph@@ ony orchestra , which has found its musical instruments to overcome them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drugs abuse and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental meeting with a French pilot that launched a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to meet her great passion .
they always get laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the tur@@ key you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the kids of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the Paraguay capital - on instruments which are made of re@@ trac@@ ting waste materials :
music with restored instruments which consist of local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez started to transform parts of the case into instruments .
the instruments include viol@@ ins , viol@@ ets , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trombone and percussion that were all manufactured from the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ede@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , remembered the beginning of time :
first of all , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them did not live with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o changed anything , which he had never seen before : one out of tr@@ ash produced .
today there is a complete orchestra , which plays on instruments made of re@@ prepared material and is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance :
each year the world generates approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and live by him are the troubles - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing companies
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought .
this entry was written by Emma Br@@ yce , originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted via international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before it was seeking the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly applied accordingly , and incl@@ ined little incl@@ ined to welcome a bur@@ gl@@ ar of this kind to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised quickly against the ship . they refused him to share one of their ports and refused to share a fisher@@ man &apos;s conc@@ ession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was sur@@ round about countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; remembers Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled out of the waters of the region : it was not managed to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses crimin@@ als and protect resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa was founded : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network were driven out of six countries , which at that time had been driven out of their waters at the time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is conce@@ aled because of it is extremely difficult to view , it is illegal fishing a main cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the estimated dis@@ regard of existing laws which should be protected by the particular habit@@ ats and types , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems , which have a delicate balance .
however , during actions against illegal fishing once were handic@@ apped through bureaucr@@ atic obstacles , and also through the worm @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are in real time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange the lists of existing licenses , news of susp@@ icious activities or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when moving these on the open sea , via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to character@@ ize ships which fish in banned areas - such as such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ide@@ als , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal law .
countries , which are against illegal fishing , can refuse to refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo as in the case of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a ber@@ ber company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already known platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishermen penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing boats , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . amongst these , even those illegal fishermen .
to their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying Ph@@ ant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and precisely this leg@@ ale hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found fle@@ eing ships and found fle@@ eing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for fighting crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances .
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations show us quite far in the networks of organized crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that can help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships in precise locations .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be enhanced , helps to cover the illegal vessels that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO which also works with fish@@ eries and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be purchased by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is helping to build a system which connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one program model
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations actually affect the wrong global issue of illegal fishing companies ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships .
there are evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als , but also deter them .
ships that f@@ ished previously without licensing and hardly to calculate consequences , know that they are ob@@ tain@@ able .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating F@@ ISH @-@ i had a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats have more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 found the insp@@ ectors there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are six countries gathered in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . it is now the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With safety , the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member states could report its first major triumph in Somalia : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under wrong flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing .
the ship was also divided into prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations .
they apply as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela has rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum , the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes were negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the back of Venezuela ) allow both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regi@@ o MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in central @-@ north , the state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , resulting in everyday life of Vene@@ tians through an acute lack of food and drugs .
many representatives of the Opposition saw in the ten@@ ure of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro as a chance for a fundamental change ; however , finally , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ effective at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government statement as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % on the financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to be the chance to withdraw its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .
the alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round Table of the Democratic Unity ) , joined by the opposition to the support of the National Assembly , which was planned on October 27th as well as a march to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ elan government seat , on November 3 , should continue to continue the blocking of the refer@@ end@@ ums to the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter , as follows :
it is far as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national strike , and on November 3 all after Caracas to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .
continue to say ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Cy@@ V@@ Gl@@ d@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the return of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; The retreat of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time , testify to other things a overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with police officers and advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ators , who calls through the protective signs : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hungry ? &quot; she cri@@ es at this Venetian .
it is enough , without sh@@ it .

on Twitter there are images that tell of disp@@ utes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the central @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there , protest@@ ers return to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira have no sk@@ irts , because you could see something that could not have many nation@@ alities !
meanwhile , an Inf@@ ographic is already making a round that forms the extent of oppression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the claim after a official statement - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs are :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fake .
this is your ten@@ ure !
on the street !
other protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has undertaken a little against the dis@@ astro@@ us economic crisis , and more prefer@@ able to have critical voices to the dis@@ astro@@ us :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the fair@@ yt@@ ale always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media to be hungry to take part in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is a adap@@ tive version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano who has been released on August 23 , 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argentin@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine town of Cordoba .
in the meantime , in the frame of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , Qui@@ x@@ ano said to his father in the province of Cordoba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were studied , which were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he retained the sec@@ rec@@ y sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was in order .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not recognize that my father was a thief , fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was a deputy commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed , which is charged for kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows , which great power has a parent over his child , and as this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had a young boy , the mar@@ tial arts made me .
all known him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and urged me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one from the ERP .
pass only that they do not have a day to escape you , and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party .
so he for@@ b@@ ade me again to go to the Sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be obe@@ yed .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had taken me .
on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university inclu@@ sions , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything .

&apos; there the prisoners are tortured . &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first time and last time he was waiting at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wrapped p@@ bread , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big cl@@ ump silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed and under@@ took me with a guard .
suddenly he clari@@ fies an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I went in , and saw a song , tortured on people .
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just there .
they grab@@ bed a man of hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shed him with water , and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ Ã³n Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the ank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carrying eyes .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who also was indicted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses where naked people were down with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people were silent on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed I looked at the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Why have you brought me anything else ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were killed and buried in a pit , and were buried by soldiers .
I know this , because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero sm@@ ashed a man and killed .
( according to the survi@@ vors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Trial , was also indicted by students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the Memorial La Per@@ la , led by the former torture chambers .
the path that you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ ap came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and tortured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of un@@ loading a number .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of above came to be moved .
this was a lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of human beings and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all the stolen things to home .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war troph@@ ies &quot; - as they knew it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war troph@@ ies are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one has to be fought against an enemy .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I always asked myself , how my father , the head of security forces , could bring with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal , and I said , And you , whom you walk on the street ?
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded anger , crying me , crying , crying ,
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and bring you down .
we don &apos;t need any others !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ out pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing to home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been a member of this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay me to burden what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ u@@ rous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you are only children , you recognize the value of a lifetime .
one develops further , and recognizes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so well , you were ex@@ iled during the dictatorship , but why the bodies disappear ?
why children escape ?
one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could just be put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill those people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people do not have families who were able to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ u@@ rous act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of prisoners .
they were grin@@ d and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything will always remain .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed men ! &apos;
just to say it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , signi@@ fy my father , was created during a conversation he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all of the atro@@ cities that I had to do with him .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
I felt so ridic@@ ulous and asked me why the whole ex@@ agger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; were supposed to defend them , actually well .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me what to me ?
I have seen how you killed men !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
he only said &quot; Na then show me . &quot;
exactly what did I do .
in 2010 , I received the first ad .
I finally knew that he was a criminal .
no one can imagine that I am pre @-@ shot . I finally said to my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 standing before the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 416 criminal charges : among them heavier , un@@ just@@ i@@ fying freedom of freedom in 158 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years of child .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the judgement .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Trial committed the crimes against 7@@ 16 victims because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 . he was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death sentences in 28 cases and sentenced in nine cases in prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were no release .
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the process .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape through officers . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism
all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police belonging and civil staff .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was ab@@ duc@@ ted along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he established the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for many years in justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the process took more than three years , but research took 39 years .
in March 2007 the Argentin@@ ean government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located there , that a memorial could be built there , now led by human rights organisations .

a translation errors makes elderly people in Kyoto too &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in social media .
processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers have been renew@@ ing a newly opened centre in which you can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month witnesses a very special translation .
in a sign , the Japanese word is supp@@ ort@@ able by the Japanese word ( ko@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , maybe - but perhaps also with mal@@ ign@@ ant backgrounds , and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists . &quot;
the wrong translation was read on electronic ads on the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
the processing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared into the social media .
the mistake was a translator , Julian Holmes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os , and he was also that the Lok@@ al@@ ids carefully made it carefully .
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n &apos;s Kyoto Protocol wrote in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
the in@@ correct English translation was initially removed . it was later replaced by the &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; ( German : &quot; horri@@ ble motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate designation &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture were ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they stated that the error was already checked in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked in their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blog@@ ger reported about the exc@@ use :
&quot; we &apos;re sorry that elderly people felt by in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News sat a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan .
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved , but definitely for concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens . this represents a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens caused 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has dropped in total , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period increased .
the nam@@ ent non @-@ known rep@@ orters brought comments on the release of the article comments on the light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) isn &apos;t that reality ? &quot;
- &quot; Is the translation actually not really , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that it &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot;
there are no few that comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
for example , one requires two important skills : passive language skills to understand the preparation and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires active behavi@@ ours of the target language - something that is in case of mother@@ ly language . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers should be .
thus , a French native language should translate as an example of English in French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding , quot@@ ations , or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees have to make translations yet fir@@ men@@ intern@@ ally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really appreciated .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that arise through machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator yet . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , among them also the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that are often used T @-@ shirts or bags are only used for sty@@ list@@ ical reasons - not to be read or understood at all .

translation errors may be acceptable , or at least harmless . but of large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the City of Kyoto uses a serial source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and travel measures on the Internet and television take part
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday , April 7th , Venezu@@ elan Internet users have no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter .
later , other users wrote that Internet access will not be accessible from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV .
other online broad@@ caster contributed to the protests of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups who resist the Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is caught , and recommended the Us@@ ers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezu@@ elan providers are once locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ itated for protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission was threatened with cash prizes and closure , when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative television channels I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing , that &apos;s still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings .
previous research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that local internet providers are using DNS at times . this is a technique to answer the DNS servers of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds in@@ correct or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ bow oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV @-@ cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flo@@ res who transferred the protests in Caracas live in custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody .
eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV was resum@@ ed .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by the Internet connections : in order to continue the access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country .

shortly before her degree in the university , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the one has become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas one den@@ otes the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money , gives her min@@ der@@ ous son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprentices@@ hip and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for this countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse of abuse , and all that can not lift up .
in Paraguay , this as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is widely distributed in Paraguay due to involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
in doing so , she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , cher@@ ished and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things in the name , for the feeling of gratitude to be vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , is generally consistent in general .
the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is , on the other hand , the family , who will close their daughter in faith , making it possible to improve their position in society and make something out of itself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl with itself and whose exploitation was just@@ i@@ ded with the belief that they would not get a chance , who would not get an apprentices@@ hip and might even be star@@ red .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
if the girl is mist@@ re@@ ated , his family will be experienced only many years later .
sometimes they never experienced them .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent strikes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military camp Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a official name at the residents of the company .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived at their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants , 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira moved with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they showed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go for death of the girl &apos;s death .
they recorded the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest reports and demanded that there were no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded an independent investigation of the case .
they want that Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to death .
if the case before the court comes , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is coming from court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as a workforce ; they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k in which her father worked to register the bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost his work .
their brothers had to work all , and began to sell on the street or on the market of sweets to make money .
they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
in doing so , she had to share the time that you stayed time for learning .
they rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , it cleaned the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished furniture and disinf@@ ect the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they had finished with learning , the more leisure time it had .
but this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never star@@ ve , but got not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the house of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the househ@@ older , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the master of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , standing beside him and to read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them to give no belief in the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habits , &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ who would speak to their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they had the formation they had allowed to lose , explains , explains them .
it was , however , totally clear that she had paid them for everything she had paid for them with their hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a dis@@ crimin@@ ates . &quot; a matter about which almost never spoken is M@@ ob@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , to which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognise that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite you to home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clearly that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Company budget the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , in which you can share a job placement for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please call you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third commentary &quot; a girl from the state of interior , I want to work . &quot;
then the author of the display turned to once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look to whether it works with her .
thank you very much , I write back when something is .
the business was completed .
in pro@@ log to report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testim@@ oni@@ als say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice among the Spanish conquest ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , who received the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ani country in Paraguay , and the indigenous population had to give tribute to them that many girls and boys had to give themselves in a system of slavery , with which they will be slight victims for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show are the key to understanding the phenomena known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill proposes Egyptian users social media to register in the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
posted in Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary report submitted a bill to &quot; the regulatory systems in regard to the use and commercial social networks . &quot;
if he is accepted by Parliament , users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , then a place would be set up , which means that , citizens and citizens should use a permit to share social media .
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register users and users at the site of the site with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it failed to do this , that could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and of Egypt , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running and used through the Internet and communicate with others using voice , video and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is set through , since the design is no indication of it , as Egyptian authorities are supposed to make the registration for users who don &apos;t register , considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , member of Parliament and sponsors of the Legisl@@ ative Law , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot;
that could mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technical Officer ( based on German &quot; Senior Research Institute &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , declared Global Vo@@ ices :
I doub@@ ted greatly to the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could control physical public and private spaces , as well as they could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they can apply a strong surveillance system to charge citizens who want to apply a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to bring it to a court process .
this is technically not so realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional System before entering the debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ Hawai@@ y proposed a law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment for those who were intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order of threatening &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in nor@@ theastern Iraq work the animal welfare H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ government organisation Nature Iraq , to protect the Irish leop@@ ard Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , who , through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are because of wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their life and they always find less spo@@ ils .
why is this particular type of Leopard so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian leop@@ ard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the thought of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually is low and goes towards zero . when the team ensures a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza broke out in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country that exists not only from war and conflict .
she has been involved in field trials for wild animals since six years and has been involved in Nature Conservation for six years .
since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensure that protection zones are set up for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the liberal daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the nor@@ theastern Japan have been achieved to re@@ build the lives of those who have been affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast pre@@ fecture - both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring cities of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal towns of the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows that progress for six years later , to re@@ build the life of the local community .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( subject to sales , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the scheduled spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , we are still stri@@ ving to be evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ation of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ .@@ Com@@ for@@ sake , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to settle in final spare parts .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in living accommodations .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such circumstances .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the disaster has been moved into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is at 34 percent .
the status of works and daily life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung could determine , 10@@ 74 out of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune , their doors will return to December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries have recovered their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , moved into compassion in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 hectares of cultivated fields of Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely re@@ covering again , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated .
tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 per cent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still can feature only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them of the status of reconstruction and , as you can find themselves opposite the tsun@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the native population in experience .
the survey was that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ amis .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents think that still not enough were done in disasters with disasters .
just as it stands for those who are evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also witness of the worst , disaster @-@ causing , nuclear accident , the Japan .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to territories outside the pre@@ fecture .
in early 2016 a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , have been moved to permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated communities are more than 50 years old . they have to be more than 50 years old because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima are competing with massive construction projects . this is about building projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people met people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the common simil@@ ar@@ ities .
however , after a while , one often acknowle@@ dges that one more connects than it seems to look at first sight .
these global connections are important because they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately ultimately became very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely this global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal subjects that often get fewer attention when they earn less attention than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ con@@ i talks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about how the love of music worked out in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time where they worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 , this week was delivered to the intensive care station : last Friday a police officer was defeated at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia in a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the university university Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ ctions .
doctors accredited him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as a critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures , the face of the police officers , who was identified with a strike attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the investigation was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia and his strike on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer had che@@ ated by demonstr@@ ators and landing at the intensive care station , his face would be six months long on TV and the whole supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and share several sanitary shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also emerged in the social networks .
in the bottom of the clip , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state of state , Internet users have donated some 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to meet a part of the cost of medical treatment and to make his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activist police have been assassin@@ ated by his father , because he was sabot@@ aging the Occup@@ y Movement in Sek@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who has been attacked by a police station after he had been attacked by a polic@@ emen who hit him with a strike .
police transfer
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where he came to protest@@ ers on the last Friday .
polic@@ emen were put on protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against protest@@ ers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ested by pressing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted via a cereb@@ ral glass windows to illustr@@ ate with a photo their cover pages .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must recognize , if you are stri@@ ving against any form of damage .
also here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , excessive importance , and the typical violence of the military police will overcome by head@@ lines with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police . &quot;
those of the un@@ induced forgotten villages in Cuba
the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the public church Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - that there is no notable sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane were l@@ ah@@ m@@ ated .
after the earth , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some rarely changed the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to factories that still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo env@@ ying on each day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar@@ cane industry do not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are in the eastern region of sugar@@ cane factories , which after long @-@ active time in operation , because they were preserved .
that was something he was not expected .
N@@ ene remembers us to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad administration decisions , and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harvest@@ ing are no more new .
why was the Cuban sugar cane switched off ?
the old railway platform of the village saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : 155 sugar@@ cane factories were technically re@@ ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable for the country .
initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the global market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , by the OECD and FAO , by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and nutrition organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today &apos;s day will go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of re@@ structure began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , over 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , the word that he is most repeated , &quot; betra@@ yal . &quot;
almost all surveyed said : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first anniversary year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents , which would only be removed from parts that would be removed , the address at the date and the date .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ an Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any dis@@ astro@@ us .
from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ closed factory for two years , and he was one who received letters . &quot; the country had no money for the factory in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the dis@@ closure of the factory , in whose construction he helped , involved .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the communities in which they were created .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut @-@ speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed to work for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by mapping .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the National Assembly Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always to better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory completed , or better when they began to crash it , they also listened to the road to asph@@ alted , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced old age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future @-@ perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not once for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
in late 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma back to the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harvest the old soldiers bring a retirement of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no down@@ ward person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not .
they have tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years of age , not because it is missing in force , but because he is bit@@ tern@@ ed .

first Nations you@@ ths use hip @-@ hop to express itself and receive its own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
you@@ ths from the First Nations Communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do they do by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour we have been running mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres , to accommodate youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ ws @-@ communities and then working with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop increases with the fact that the young participants in our conversations on issues such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever makes them in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ neb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to con@@ vey as important of ob@@ taining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people will not always rule the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group who gave them a verse in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse verse is available , as well as translation into English , which is translated into English here :
sometimes I feel , nobody ever would be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to walk my days on earth
this is the day when you will betra@@ y our cry .
because we lost our way to life in life
but I believe that we will raise us one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so you can grow and go ahead of our youth
thus , they can do what they intended for the creator
in the commentary part of the readers and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sil@@ ver@@ side ( which is also published on his blog and is re @-@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( to be found ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes at almost any restaurant .
in order to show potential customers , what exactly is on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( nature , nature , &quot; Plastic models of the courts &quot; ) from each food served in this restaurant .
the customers look at this plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is an entire industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes , which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even stri@@ ve them all . however , a new trend is transformed into current mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ oms published the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i range of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new with plastic rib@@ bed frame tapes , as shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ t refriger@@ ators mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the food provisions is becoming increasingly popular .
in this case a cave @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone support .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
this part is also produced for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing occasion into the Kom@@ ische .
some mobile phone support and cell designer allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping that will be served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise your colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile phone support has the form of mel@@ on ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand tapes from dried salmon .
you can watch further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # attention .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then you &apos;ll find a gli@@ mp@@ se of the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood which is dedicated to the exposure of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes can actually be produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of survi@@ vors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for victims of struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico , the mi@@ xes and ge@@ ared regularly dives only in statistics . however , this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the S@@ inal@@ oa box , pressed the stories of the victims of conflict entirely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , barely any one looks at the dream or to the municipalities that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone and in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds perhaps never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with the drug trading &quot; ) , which is supposed to give a voice and tell stories of people living in the fight between prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear changes &quot; ) tell exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is seeking secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost their father to only one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have asked us to get rid of and to graves , according to the people who we loved are looking for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip .
there is also my mother , who also is with me here .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because you demand a mortality .
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; editors , why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just need to show the faces of those who are afraid . we need to show the international community conflicts , frag@@ ility , and state control .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have now known disease and sensation since some years .
I come past every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology , or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me from the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect toward the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be equal or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen songs about the &quot; hel@@ dent@@ ations &quot; of the off@@ ender , when they go through the streets .
for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone who have lost , and those who fear them also something .
I see our weakness , if stories can be exposed in a statistic .
the in@@ tim@@ el@@ essness of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were &quot; rise . &quot;
I think they try to talk about these trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t touch and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of press@@ ors in the main city district : &quot; she describes how an armed crime month was captured by her business until they had not only destroyed the store at the end , but also their family apart .
you think all that you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , if you are alone .
the habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it &apos;s absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kill or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , if weeping was my profound feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the contribution &quot; The forgotten kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : &quot; a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a Wa@@ iting and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to make a egg coo@@ ks , potatoes , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and to learn to live so far .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead body of his father was shot dead by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 as violence due to organised crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city of the world due to the number of murder in public security and government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 murders . this represents an average of 8,5 murders per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul .
few stories still live in view of the new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is launched in 2015 , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers who tortured the country in the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he re@@ lin@@ t , contain pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment in which it &apos;s about to raise a rum@@ or or un@@ mask a fake .
but how is the years having di@@ pped the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pass further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident 7 years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to consider trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - denied not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our lon@@ ging to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tan@@ ker passed the place S@@ ange at the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came into life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neglec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous par@@ ades full of stro@@ ll@@ s that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , fell victim to the tan@@ ker .
the representative is described by a Fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinemas close , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer World Cup .
houses rever@@ ed and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the imm@@ or@@ ality .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of stolen body that up@@ sets up on the ground during which they are looking at .
but here the story doesn &apos;t find her end .
over the years , the same photo was taken out for several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not to be attributed to trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ superior Nig@@ erian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically from atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bars .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one has remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a population to Human Rights Watch .
many have been cut , shot or burned .
only using satellite images , the follow @-@ up period could be illustrated .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ clari@@ fied , but the army point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am trial ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as a evidence for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of patches with patches ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was carried out as a cover for measures .
another step further brings personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ sely fal@@ sely the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a declaration , by the United Nations , those who were able to flee ra@@ kes , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ dic Arab news page , which was fal@@ sely told , the president My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an Being said , monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to record this information .
the original contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations , which called AFP as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ a Being this statement , but did not have taken the picture from the DR Congo in connection .
the world wide range of false information
vest@@ iges of this wrong coupling cuts until the year 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information borders can be exceeded .
a controversial picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images , which are very similar to the mentioned image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask of private pages , platforms social media and community and national publications , and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , have others tried to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
we have provided examples of un@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they were published . by doing so , we want to represent the range more clearly than the language only .
several examples of ab@@ used use can be used from the listed countries ( which were also connected together in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be seen yet completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ related countries prove on pages or server , about the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples which are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia offers two extreme example for an un@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo , with a twe@@ et that expresses sympath@@ y compared to the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blog@@ ger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published an explanation of what she was as &quot; inten@@ tionally presented news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot;
this imp@@ lication , which has been published exclusively in English , also involves references to counter@@ feit images of rum@@ ors that kill H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and of extrem@@ ist groups to kill the Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s and the other ( which often is widely distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an Being in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture will continue to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ oli@@ an news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly explained that the image was not derived from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ ha@@ th@@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is sleeping ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims in the 2015 massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the port on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , which were suspected in the name of Islam , having found a larger attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was dr@@ illed as proof for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in relation to Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposed to be written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; on the Nig@@ erian massacre in circulation , discussion discussions like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the message in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ etic missionaries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
for other accounts , ag@@ gregate and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye is also going to be tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / data stamps do not exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and have them transmitted via image files in relation to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly in the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) who passes these Po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to bigger discussions about the silence in the context of Christians through Muslims , Muslims - the murdered victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
religion Under@@ standing and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can &apos;t give these images any longer faith .
with social media , there are many people who un@@ inten@@ tionally put the share of drinking water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and mis@@ ery that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and sm@@ ashing it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that it is rec@@ eding from pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images will even demand even from the victims itself .
at the same time , concern that violent images readers and viewers can take advantage of emp@@ athy to emp@@ athy the emp@@ athy ( such as this study to help others to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss non @-@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact , fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they are thoroughly suggested in which a picture suggests that which is actually loos@@ ened from the context or completely mis@@ used manner .
however , every investigation could be in@@ correct but also consider how internationally they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simmons was used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ mistak@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer speech enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish brakes ) .
but all resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists include Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog one finds words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ Ã¼@@ h for your parents in recognition of how to have been stri@@ ving for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; truck adi &quot; - The convenience , or sl@@ oth , you feel after a cold days in the sun .
in Burma &apos;s own words about :
they det@@ ects other cultures , reveal other thought @-@ ups and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of this &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure Holiday &quot; who are very appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to un@@ load their favorite pictures here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island nation Sri Lanka looks at the moment the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ sc@@ aped disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually puts at the end of May , are caused by strong rainfall the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following a statement by the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing due to floods and slaughter .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure stay .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the volumes in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos have an impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water volumes of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ shi@@ ped the den@@ ces crisis , Save the Children , after further rain falls on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded with G@@ alle des Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made for transport of emer@@ gen@@ cies included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also been explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water environment and humanitarian aid .
if you require any search and rescue teams for its operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for anyone who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for high @-@ water treatment -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the Tax@@ ol App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ thal@@ um is informed .
last year following the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; high water aid &quot; key , which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then for@@ warded to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross .
likewise , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; key , which had more than thousands of qu@@ eries and 150 successful boat saving actions for floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exhausted , residents bring people in need of security and help assist in need of help .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
U@@ ser@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girl@@ friend .
I trusted her my four years old daughter , she entrusted me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the one minute we call for par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next sc@@ oring we add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some stop the iconic image of a woman with head scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ies to Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my friend looks at me and says , &quot; these things do not affect you , isn &apos;t ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; I wonder .
I have already run this conversation .
people living with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their performance .
they susp@@ ects me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all right away .
we practice our religion different .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different kind of art . but somehow we put all in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , which will not fit there , are mus@@ li@@ fied .
Ent@@ mus@@ li@@ mis@@ ed will become
I do not say that alone .
that &apos;s even the poet that poetry is best selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures are in the sense when you think about it ?
love ? love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but religion was extingu@@ ished in the western idea , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of Muslims &apos;s reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been colon@@ ised for centuries .
these enti@@ cing image language is determined by the dark man that should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , American scientist Edward Said laid out history behind these pictures .
but these images continue to stand still today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to continue .
I have been working for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faulty nar@@ r@@ ative our new@@ s@@ feeds domin@@ ate .
this narr@@ ative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries in the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even select their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative fail to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented , their head@@ scar@@ f will bear in public buildings and Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group pract@@ ised his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ativ weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which were brought about hi@@ ther with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narr@@ ative has reli@@ ed deeply and f@@ law@@ ed our collective pre@@ dispos@@ ition , that often si@@ kh men and children become an end @-@ to @-@ end attacks and jack@@ ets .
because of these stories we tell , and because of the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just talk stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives , who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to fail to capture the narr@@ ative of 1.7 billion dollars .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation that come from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewellery design in 5th Avenue and my father worked hard to the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made by the Muslim , American Stati@@ stical from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time the sky@@ lines of the world was newly out , my parents were innocent Muslims and Americans .
but am I the Muslim and American woman now ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I am not a pork , I say - instead of getting out my Muslim recipes or carry out my hand@@ some T@@ ash@@ ore , whom all Muslims suffer from yourself - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am scher@@ ze , we do not wear all T@@ asch@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who stri@@ ve to fight far widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the running volume of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bes with fin@@ ders , think tanks and experts for counter@@ feit information which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell , and because of the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than a stranger which one woman breaks the head .
or as a terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born then in my pre@@ dispos@@ ition , when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , conduct and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend would see my dar@@ ling , my rock in the bran@@ ding that I am Muslim , if they could take over 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening rit@@ ual with my daughter when I said them in my arms , and to protect the Arab verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I pray therefore , that it is protected from evil , the evil man that can see , and evil that is not able to see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging is the image of my Grand@@ mother &apos;s maternal part with her sisters , as she wants to win a competition for the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi before decades .
it is the picture of you that I look at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of ancient Su@@ fi @-@ Saint ; and an Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that they can almost express .
Muslim means to be the prayer that she had said to me , when I have a bad day .
the Muslim is to be in it , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who became colonial for over centuries - through a &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name hon@@ our@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning , God , to call my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to up and to hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time I see that my home grandfather wept .
in the meantime , during which he writes books on the modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was un@@ shu@@ ff@@ led around his family in India , family that he was not allowed in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as in my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who shared the Muslim world as the risk of risk .
Muslim Brotherhood means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have to colonial all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first air@@ ship of history was thrown off before a Muslim country in front of a century .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , a Indian , k@@ ash@@ less subject of British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; because he led the first mosque in England .
even before they had air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , deep in our memorable pedi@@ gre@@ ens are back ; our un@@ matched history .
it means that fourteen years ago , the world &apos;s most powerful military in the world , with troops that were spread over every continent apart from the Antarc@@ tica , had to pursue the weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy bears the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was proclaimed by a freed black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist name named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X call an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope I feel if we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
an American woman to be a p@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , a Muslim , a journalist and a journalist , however , to fail to communicate with multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion bir@@ ders has more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
a mother too means to worry about my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons are built on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it is in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in immigration agents , who takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that extends its borders over people from just across the countries who bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the visor .
there are wars that we lead and the bombs we cast on Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and because of them that we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically in@@ correct image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation , which we have to lead
we are too deep , to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
we stand for decades , the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ t@@ ful and dangerous expression of expression we missed in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry which attempts to capture our multi@@ ples with con@@ jun@@ ctions and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ g@@ o Square secret lives of black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , prolifer@@ ative Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pakistan , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality Muslim American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for con@@ spir@@ ited theore@@ ti@@ cian , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , because they made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , by making it &quot; others . &quot;
a few years before , it had not been given them ; now they have large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and the history of which I was not aware when I was so old , as I was now my daughter , but that made me a Muslim Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ bs in my speech .
things , maybe aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ section that makes our humanity , likes a story , where someone is made to another &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley you will find con@@ vers@@ ations within the 8th Annual Conference to Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
these are no terms , with which we usually throw in our schools or read that in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the weapons of &quot; others &quot; in the public performance , for four decades myself scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions following the role of him , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously , as my friend and me in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we don &apos;t have a new future , while he had already broken down countries and &quot; to others &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion euros .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative of narr@@ ative art wants to preserve urban lingu@@ istic diversity
history count , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND license .
can there be an opportunity to enter here and in spite of a language barrier with someone else ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the stories of stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about an international initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ mistak@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and appreciate it .
in fact , urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin exists in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS already has conducted events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not available to the children born there .
for the makers of the project applies :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we accept cities , accept diversity - safe areas where residents do not have to forget who they are to be added .
while &quot; listening often is associated to understand &quot; these events take instead of &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel , to slip . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller points their story in their own language and translate or explain it to English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and its representation will ensure that the listen@@ ers are on it .
they call laugh@@ ing and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of narr@@ ative .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having explained the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his sense of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project can be arranged with T@@ LS in order to organize their own history count .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re @-@ establish sovereign debt

the inter@@ c@@ ession of the re@@ constitution of debt also submitted a pet@@ ition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os claims that the politicians , b@@ Ã¤n@@ kers and government agencies , responsible for the debt responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial test and a tap committee without personal interests in public debts , with a permanent , our working conditions of the compensation , which is responsible for the economy .

the people of Puerto R@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be fin@@ alized with sin@@ king retirement payments .
we require immediate action .

therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on the soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state control .
these are their reasons :

the measures imposed on the outside measures will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens , to be rejected by the people .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missed throughout a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he provided for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that will be alig@@ ned to Berlin , dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of France @-@ resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼hl@@ ing , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ ner ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective neighbour research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is licensed here , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression .
it is an homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to er@@ ect , like movements for free knowledge , and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side to look over the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feeds and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive remembered gives his friends and his family a voice to push his release , and they want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us may begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of tim@@ ely extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was removed from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was cont@@ acted by individuals on November 12 , 2015 and presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government and they were aware of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his position and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in creating access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes was more than the work that he started with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and the melting of Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ ther@@ ly traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , bass couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything in it , this architecture that em@@ bodies only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this move into the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and conservation has created a tim@@ sel , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el was unable to shut up this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life so that I dream of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call upon his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read English well , to write and speak English .
he always shared his knowledge of everyone who has asked . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught others , as they use computers , at least in theory , without that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a pro@@ stit@@ ch which she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015 .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have been working together in the book a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ ed the lyrics when she visited him , and he translated them from the Arab in English .
the book is licensed free .

it happens in every visit ,
that I hide in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the in@@ breeding in the moment , in which we embrace us ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards

I agree with passion for me ,

and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my sol@@ itude ,
to get back all the moments ,
and over your absence to weep and smile .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :

bass &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
since 2011 , according to international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .

Mozambique : due to corruption convicted director after detention release again
Mozambique was re@@ acted with anger on a corruption in which a government member re@@ returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , at which the corruption was committed .
it is the case of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants , sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 .
the money came from public funds in the airports of Mozambique , the council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good guide and immediately requested his return to the company , which happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which requested the application , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza to refer back to his old posts , as the company did not fulfil any discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ isation process after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants are not doing the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short of C@@ IP ) , an official institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clearly illustr@@ ate the absence of transparency and is even a set@@ back in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so C@@ IP .
what we need to know is that the company would have to lead to a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ act method against the disp@@ utes .
the firm was silent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ ian social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considered the case as &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be advis@@ ors when he was sentenced to a prison sentence and has served half of them .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has grown to become re@@ integrated into the company which he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
resi@@ stible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ be , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil , says the director of no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he did not believe him that one was rewarded for someone who has already insul@@ ted the state in such a way .
Cam@@ b@@ aza missing the mor@@ ality to return and to serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of serving herself on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as hand@@ held it to an in@@ exhau@@ stible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was invited and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Mozambique will not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ cut and - by the other , proph@@ etic redund@@ ant .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was ener@@ g@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious human being able to be able to sell his own concern for his amb@@ itions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know whether a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tac@@ tics , but he doesn &apos;t turn from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free .
and today , the company relies upon him with which he promised to forgive them again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - ( Î±@@ - _ Raf@@ ik ) , 12th May 2017

Facebook is blocked the r@@ assi@@ stic word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the bur@@ s@@ ous word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or co@@ age .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network adopted its posts from the network because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally as ad@@ jec@@ tively &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook gives the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or to be selected in the social network as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , Ascen@@ sion has given radical nation@@ alistic movements to the word an extremely ab@@ rupt con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as an Hass@@ elt against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat Hass@@ elt in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word is calling on automatically .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the use of his used , cen@@ sored .
beyond , there are several bur@@ s@@ ous words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same book@@ table like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese also wrote &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letter as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age &apos; ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ ups A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on spiritual way whether she could w@@ ander as he could lie@@ ve his back pain by making a word play .
the phr@@ u la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ alls is the opinion that she has to reduce their language radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic before it re@@ jects all the posts that spread rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion , rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ s the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what to do instead , is carefully analyze and control it by checking the opposite words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age no@@ zzles ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , the Hass@@ elt of Hass@@ elt , received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to compl@@ ain its nation@@ alism .
while the action will send a strong signal to all that hate @-@ language , the efficiency of this strategy does not like long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship of perc@@ ussions often become a cat@@ astroph@@ ic and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts , when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was listening to this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , posts and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; The Facebook Community Standards didn &apos;t escape . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative inten@@ tions , or they simply try to demonstrate their views against the hate radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author gave his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are badly in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more about the start of the initiative , for example the bur@@ s@@ ische Internet community by Council :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words , only more hatred will be put within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; hei@@ g@@ cur@@ ry &quot; have been forbidden .
even as they found out that they did not have mistakes , they were unable to report the fal@@ si@@ bly deleted Po@@ sts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they have a large turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship is su@@ ck@@ led by users for a lot .
instead of taking it seriously , users can now write about Facebook fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ elt to see if your posts will be taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language , but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and let pe@@ a cur@@ ry eat and watch a Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word of Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
post office says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence their influence .
among other things , hate language should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands of escape .
Facebook has been nominated for his failure to talk to his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control , critic@@ ised .
but instead of just reading the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context than in code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is finished with the chil@@ dr@@ ens

the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s Parliament unanimously decided to offer a law that is to offer this practice so that the un@@ married age is 18 .
prior to this change of the husband of marriage and Muslim religious communities participated in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj was gathered to a group of representatives of the various religious groups in the country , that the state didn &apos;t inter@@ fere with the state that the state does not im@@ pose the maturity . &quot;
this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN children &apos;s just@@ ification , defined min@@ ors for everyone , under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 had already been married in Trinidad and Tobago in 2.8 percent , and 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 boys .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , who stri@@ ves to bring laws to the chil@@ ds , followed at the foot and rejo@@ ining great support . no doubt they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du FÃ¼hrer , for instance , had no concerns to tell the critics of the children &apos;s before , they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind religious opposition sor@@ row@@ ed for ten@@ sions in this actually in@@ complicated matter , and at some point , doubts , whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of opposition and an independent that contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him to the law .
now only the president of the country must agree , and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which read Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against Child was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes .
after he had decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws have been last modified .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial Meeting in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary od@@ ede used to suffer the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now is worth every price .
while Abel was in mind that it was definitely enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was very happy that the day was finally come :
public status @-@ update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Excell@@ ent News !
the sp@@ inning network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law noted :
the married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now , independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change of marriage was today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s toe is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago not anymore .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ aw .
many thanks to all activists who have been fo@@ iled him .
congratulations .

but a possible hook depends on the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
before months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise now .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said that Mahar@@ aj would like to go against the law , most social media users would be subject to the subject matter differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion as general , in a way that we may feel free to talk about the problem , that the state that our daughters may protect against them that they may be ab@@ used in advantage , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still more places in the world where the pra@@ ises in different gra@@ d@@ ations or continue the standard , although there are laws which they reject .

by reflection of websites , Turkish users can check Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , according to SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright legislation in the United States , internationally ev@@ apor@@ ated .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than a month Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and fans of TV series are fighting against the lock .
although many techniques have been used to use re@@ positi@@ onal websites ( a recent article from the New York Times noted that Turkey has not reported the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ esc@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users are not in this category .
although Turkey has been closed since 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place of regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to Wikipedia the massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked , several mirrors pages ( pages which are mir@@ ro@@ red the contents of Wikipedia and frequently are updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform based all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is avail@@ abe in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blog post published IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after having heard the messages ( via the lock of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to transfer snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ .org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it &apos;s only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to ho@@ d similar Mir@@ ror pages if the country is closed by Wikipedia .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices and employee at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
one gets to another URL , which is not the original . that which one sees then is Wikipedia .
essentially , the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad @-@ positioned moti@@ fs and fully @-@ washed colours .
this motivated him a camera to wear and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
at that time he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ as , stri@@ ves to bring to the international stage .
and his home location next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ther the attention to Nep@@ as wildlife .
he described Facebook as the first @-@ class situation in his work helps him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could give it better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just returned home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River was a leop@@ ard .
the river is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ ad images ! !
Sag@@ ar pursu@@ es a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious as they look like .
and he ought to know , because he had already stood tiger &apos;s face to face to face :
a tiger may not inter@@ fere with the opinion of sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also , because of the darkness he was in the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he puts down immediately , and see me by the S@@ al trees ! !

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again released as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
in many parts of India , there are women with the greatest care , the names of their husbands or even by older males in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband due to the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should be mis@@ ed to preserve this practice in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted from the Indian state of O@@ sk@@ a by a pseu@@ dost@@ em in the Indian state and ab@@ dic@@ ated by their family and the village community after having addressed a secret relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives also not to call upon behalf , is also common in men . however , they have far less laws to fear , if ever , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the Pun@@ e district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel , and house@@ wives , a unique club and therefore became the main talks of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss the delic@@ acy of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
when one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and relies on the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i has been working with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ rs to the prohib@@ itions of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and manages this clubs .
it reports about how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them at the bottom of the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , acted by women who do not call her husband .
she decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
to speak the name of their husbands , a bridge is also not guilty to all obligations and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition bears witness that a woman respects her husband and wishes to wish him a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this , is regarded as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never have taken care of this discussion round .
Roh@@ ini wanted to start at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband , has never been trying to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him at his name .
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy , that during the whole practice it was pushed forward , and another decided to allow all fru@@ stration against him and out his family , causing him to curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
nor in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ exchange , with an ancient fires broke , the women decided that they would actually try to call her husband to name her husband .
and they kept their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a wide variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put on women in the head , and his wife could not stop to tell his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law came up , she was afraid , and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understand@@ able and the situation existed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as Tra@@ gen of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red Pun@@ ching on the fore@@ head , which shows the state status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the in@@ qu@@ Ã© red dot if he had to do it .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I heard him to bear him .
the other women do not have stopped doing so , but they mean , they are now in a better position to choose him not to carry him on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip with every discussion club .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang , and talking about things about which they had never been thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on this problem for so many years and yet , I have also talked about some things , for example , such as our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never said so hon@@ estly .
it feels great to say certain things to say loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we have maintained about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have borne Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , the okay , but some wanted to bear a Sal@@ im @-@ Kur@@ ta , a large shirt about a tro@@ users ; they don &apos;t have we@@ eds .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own hang@@ ers , the mor@@ als connected with sar@@ is and much more , lubric@@ ate Roh@@ ini ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women were able to bear them .
next , they decided to plan an excursion to Go@@ a while they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
on the question of whether in the five months have been changed since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly going into the re@@ els :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to tell the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women bear now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach their lives in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ing around greater freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a difficult navig@@ able river .
by giving themselves each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club , each of us , is confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home to home and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for the organ trade , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , presumably the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the pract@@ iti@@ oner .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in Mil@@ king , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently found them that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a glorious man of gold abst@@ ain or wealth , the police Officer of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , declared the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks were registered on glorious men in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of assassin@@ ations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate these practices .
the persecution of people with alco@@ hol@@ ism is common in other countries in Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government &apos;s campaigns developed to fight those super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have prepared to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are travelling to Mozambique are destination rit@@ ual attacks , war@@ med the Muslim police after the latest ar@@ ov@@ ations of three glorious men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in Mil@@ king District , where the murdered victims were arrested .
H@@ uss@@ ed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ urban in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already entered the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ aman is involved in the death of the glorious men .
the persecution and murder of glorious individuals for the extraction and sale of its bodies in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , for probably super@@ st@@ itious rit@@ ale , has given cultural designs and will exist by the traditional sham@@ ans in favor ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to whom the victims had power in the head , the wealth of wealth .
in the last days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog@@ gers Po@@ ai@@ ppa , the suggest@@ ion that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , Mozambique is faced :
I want to believe GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , DAS S@@ ME , a country where the teachers would take care of good notes , and others not viol@@ ate their lives to make her bread , a country in neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or war@@ heads for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , or &quot; black magic , &quot; that aim to aim to get rid of wealth .
in spite of the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the phenomena , some of the opportunity for ma@@ kab@@ ene hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police Officer Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both sli@@ ps are :

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has announced attention in the international community , after his lawyer had announced in late June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( stat@@ ech@@ ing ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has been referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a speaker described it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to have views from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , permit or release a treatment abroad .
while some countries have crit@@ ici@@ zed the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
poin@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Liu in foreign countries abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ end have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government had announced that this ultimately won &apos;t have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations have been continued until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to reg@@ ain the nit@@ aries to China , since the exports had been mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ condition@@ ally release and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to increase his price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to free to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplomatic relations of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China to release the release of Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife , as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all the visits , they wish , and able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
us ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans want him to have the opportunity for the treatment of foreign affairs , in@@ sof@@ ar it is for help to help him . &quot;
an spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP announced on June 27 that the embassy was invited to release the Chinese authorities not just Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia of their house arrest .
the US embassy re@@ lie@@ ve a desert response from China following himself , with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interv@@ ene and ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom such as travel data and access to medical care of its choice , which , according to Chinese constitution and legal system , and international obligations are entitled .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push out Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I challenge China to release the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o to give yourself into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on the 7th and 8th July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex might be overs@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , John Mc@@ Call@@ um &apos;s Canadian Ambassador asked China to provide an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to provide himself from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP that Li@@ us &apos;s wife , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , contact us and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells further :
Canada calls for China to uph@@ old his international human rights issues , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old and liber@@ ate the rights of these rights .
France
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he needs , ir@@ respective of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have a contact with him .
although the news featured France Info has already reported that the French government would have welcomed Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France will ultimately absorb him .
Taiwan
the Council of the festiv@@ ities in Taiwan called on June 27 to allow Liu liber@@ ate and to show a bigger tolerance towards those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
in China , the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature urged China to allow China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on 28 June around Liu very concerned and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that he took the initiatives that he accepted and had been strictly punished with a harmon@@ ious , stabil@@ ise , and prosp@@ erous China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and legal rule in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem dum@@ b , since Singapore is recognized as independent state .
but according to Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on a meeting of the international branch of the state of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York was a democracy ...
that is , where most people get a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are a city .
we are no country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Justice Minister , &quot; to twist logic , &quot; to defend the existing auth@@ orization of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and offerings , this valuable country is to create , you can say that we are no country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a escape before the responsibilities , a mandatory .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons of Sh@@ an@@ em@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , seemed un@@ wei@@ rd un@@ democratic .
by contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike cities that are permanent from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the Th@@ as &apos;s core point , the good old suffering from the Auth@@ or@@ aries of Mach@@ ines , which pre@@ hen@@ ce@@ forth democr@@ atically , abandoned logic , since it fits better to its power .
during the final week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am he gave answers to his American guests concerning our Press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers r@@ ational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to illustr@@ ate his mind , as they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is in which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our advert@@ iser K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take this point to clari@@ fy this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the town of Singapore .
in order to publish his comment on the blog , he points out concerning the critics that you should begin to understand the entire participation of the conference , so that the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would understand better , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the signature .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; be a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so infin@@ itely important to us , even if we are free and free elections .
he understood Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was no country , &quot; he obviously not meant it in this sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who makes the leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Justice Minister of Justice has said to have ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that expects me to agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated with what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review destro@@ ys the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ em@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
does Mr Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am have committed a mistake , or was it a dream speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on what country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Govern@@ ors &apos; government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of serious significance .
why do they provoke their military service to their military service , but do not defend their own country only ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink staff ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the time of the year , Singapore is always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have neglec@@ ted many people ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite right .
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ leading aspect of your residence or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on which situation is taking place , it is regarded as polite , interest in his conversation with personal questions .
then , on my clari@@ fication , the default response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans do not cook in front of anger if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know , there are little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian banner well to their back@@ pack when they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
however , Americans are ... .
so it was even when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gay mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we say obviously very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is supposedly considered the most toler@@ ant land compared to ethnic groups .
we are not as such types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it would not make me anything if you would go to Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly , as a &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ at , meaning to be sp@@ at - such as the ben@@ ign , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure of N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has a Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can encounter .
be harmless , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn and no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far off the things that pass around .
I would even go as far as going to say that the desire is to be free and only to be one of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to worry about our own affairs .
what &apos;s back as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool polit@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we are missing the warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I have to connect with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada just sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has released a musical video that took power to the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite their promises to restore the civilian government , the country continues .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him which rules his girl@@ friend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the ongoing military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video was uploaded on Facebook and received 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
you can interpre@@ t the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , especially in the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
watch out at once these images of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that have pursued Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gave the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the host of absolute national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; unity change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are considered to be a critic by the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law about computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to susp@@ ici@@ ze activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , monitoring online content and persons who were accused of having assassin@@ ated the monarchy , criminal prosec@@ utes .
Thailand establishes a stri@@ cken accus@@ ation against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was established in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase is their choice of expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax v@@ eins .
in the video even shows how people get thrown into a black delivery v@@ ans before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are sitting in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and threatened by internet use , they should be insul@@ ted the monarchy .
meanwhile the Te@@ aser of the songs of the band , which was im@@ itated the sal@@ ut of the &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who had already been used by p@@ utsch during protests in 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ Asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East @-@ Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian War was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreciation , Geor@@ g@@ iers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called violin cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are just a few hundred people in these vul@@ va cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people had barely increased after a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
the empty five storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ kas , are symbo@@ lic@@ ally called for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

I met a native older man at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it is still clear . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community .
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , who still houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they move away immediately .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girl@@ friend , and suddenly she left the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in sub@@ sist@@ ence business ( cultivation of domestic products for the own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable engineering .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to receive no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she has supported her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calling for T@@ alya &apos;s her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .

&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day they remembers the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke off ) , they did not leave the opportunity to leave it .

her husband works in the coal ru@@ ce .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as found the kinder@@ garten once , they hold s@@ wine , cows , h@@ amm@@ ne and chickens .

&quot; we don &apos;t worry about the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly work , and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and war were once . &quot;
when our talk is incl@@ ined to the end , a small boy reminds us of us .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants in their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org on 19 April 2017 and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ p @-@ pink spectac@@ le frame and golden @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in the Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ Ã¤ren .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather she himself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are in transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants come here .
sometimes Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people coming to full bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons .
they would not refuse to refuse .
she helps them , and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam e@@ ased away from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa is a reasonable first name for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again .
you have lived in Brazil , however , it is for some Afri@@ cans , that are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other way@@ men of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the tour and that Afri@@ cans already speak on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his sign@@ posts , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ nit@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests she often send text messages when they have gone to gr@@ en her , or to report her about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught chickens to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family included migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ stu@@ ets will be sold to numerous African immigrants .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking site .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the wilderness , and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , after a raid on his work site , he was exp@@ elled from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to get money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for a accommodation and an unknown , a All@@ ende who offered it to her roof .
a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the gears you consult the trav@@ ellers quiet their teleph@@ ones .
a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother flo@@ ats her in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ y that you made a rally , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and old .
she laughs at me while she is near@@ ing her .
&quot; Ya is fu@@ eron &quot; , repe@@ ating it every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users to be able to resolve them .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile user in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
in the message , the app is said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities refused to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they were shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private cloud group .
the police report that the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , by online sc@@ am , Tro@@ users and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive , how much time they spend online and to remote control your own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors shall help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these features can of course be used in various ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; remote actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers able to manipul@@ ate or steal home network using a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures relating to control of digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the east and south , the reality is very often no@@ ster@@ er for those who live in distant , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit the un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ power@@ ing Internet shut@@ downs .

the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile message demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices which are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through un@@ coated technology .

sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane depic@@ ts his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and stell@@ st that you are completely alone in one place where everything is important .
everything has changed after and after dissolved and a truth reveals that is clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has been defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the scenes looks back and you looked behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the perform@@ ers - turn the characters into flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt , in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the monster . you will clear that you are here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , have built stone for stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the leader of security intelligence form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he introduced his power over us , destro@@ ying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five te@@ ens were torn during a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our Revolution .
it was enough to break the city &apos;s darkness at night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ened .
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ments .
in the third night the things had cal@@ ms down after the power supply had stopped in the neighborhood .
I broke down the silence by calling several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof@@ top .
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were cour@@ age@@ ous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we have joined us to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations and completely fulfilled .
in such a moment you will be aware that you have delivered the spirit out of the lamp , but it &apos;s just interested in barley .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can return to your voice , after you have sent them all the way up to the office of the security services .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you &apos;re &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough to shout , if we are not near . &quot;
his water @-@ filled eyes were set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
maybe it was at my fool@@ ishness ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so certain that I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret no word from what I said .
&quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father alike . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot;
the ank of this cursed sentence is up to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ atic torture which I was exposed to months .
I &apos;m going through the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
after that , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I prepared all the details exactly before I entered the room .
otherwise , they probably have allocated a greater cell for me this time .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may immediately put me to wait without their permission .
after a couple of minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I handle it on a well @-@ known communication method : with the Faust against the wall .
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ row@@ ling . &quot;
after a long tick he rep@@ lied to me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a prestigious man @-@ old age which looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no prominent facial features , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice is similar to me ? &quot;
all answers provide its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the great cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured to me , they would be happy when I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which l@@ ends itself to the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cry every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of the destro@@ yer is , until I saw the yellow light , presented to us the gr@@ asp in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; play on the 13th S@@ ure of Koran ) .
&quot; you are here to hear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the mystery to protect us : in order to protect the State security before us and preventing the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ we@@ ath@@ ic dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ essi@@ on@@ ential er@@ pres@@ et and dist@@ ressed the close view of their world view .
this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I kept the g@@ listening room and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it to answer me , not to answer .
I can really say no more exactly when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation for me become an ordinary communication agent .
when and how it happened was in@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to be punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment .
at punishment in all their diversity .
his commandment is to pl@@ uck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker so@@ aked at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him and you can &apos;t keep your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so that the pipe was cast out through a cable .
during my first capture , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had been working as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables in each other , to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour , three of them rarely changed , while I was still on the row .
I had lost every sense in my body - and my voice , why I listened to scre@@ am .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down and did not find favor in it , why he is next to a electrically charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor was the perfect electric conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that it was my only option .
some hours passed away , which came to me as a few minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fu@@ ker . &quot;
I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; my lord , my father must make terrible troubles . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do you lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib rau@@ cht a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib neglec@@ t the majority of his time in his own time , and he conclu@@ des on his screen , even at his computer , and again to his couch .
on what you can leave , a cigarette between his fingers and his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips can be discovered .
he lives in the Supreme Court of his family house which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel lost its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : Farmer ) .
H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activist for six years now , the conservative majority vote against gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ music .
with his music , often argu@@ ed with topics like Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also calls on the core of the entire Arab world . all of these themes will not only be found in his home town of Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that extend from Damascus to Syria by far to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at his age of 25 , H@@ da@@ ib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders , and he can feel free according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it doesn &apos;t exist openly , he turns against the US foreign policy a special en@@ umer@@ ation .
H@@ da@@ ib viewed his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib does not believe his compassion for those who want to survive in war regions , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian poultry &quot; of the second generation , &quot; so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and never existed in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib st@@ resses .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water dissolved nest cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; it is planned for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ da@@ ib has a certain weakness for breaking up with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sel@@ ess hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the sle@@ epers speak tep@@ id coffee and the scar@@ ves of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan like a prison under free sky , especially if you have a view into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water to drink - not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Interior Jord@@ anian has canc@@ eled a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila already for the second time .
some parliamentary majority support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ k@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ dict the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table is .
S &amp; D vice @-@ president of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the S@@ ang@@ ers .
many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab spring , human rights and free opinion of opinion in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that asks the ancient legitim@@ acy author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be easy to be a rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alline reality in Jordan reflect that in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs plant clearly appears .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib resi@@ sted traditional line@@ age in the body by making his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ y@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an evi@@ den@@ sely unknown woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in Jordan the number of &apos; honorary murder &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ or of Hon@@ our in 2016 reached its peak ; however , an institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women who , victims , attempted murder , or domestic violence , to be appropriate to the appropriate way .
according to a law for frag@@ ile control from the year 1954 , women who are subjected to a danger of in@@ adequate violence , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucr@@ atic expend@@ itu@@ res , as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , even not to rever@@ ence on issues surrounding in his country as tab@@ u .
H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , a fact that he may take his music , which is full of explic@@ it references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , cannot be separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was deceived policy , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed , H@@ da@@ ib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; focus on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically within the core can continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse is repeated :
&quot; you are free , and any other is it . &quot;
in the course of the songs , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market in which you can get what you want , &quot; whether faith or non @-@ belief , h@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that there are hardly anyone in Jordan concerning the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals remained strongly cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ programme Ro@@ ya in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a worked version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , which still has remained in remembrance thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the Sem@@ itic kingdom there is nothing new that the government appe@@ aled attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive votes become silence .
even recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service offered several former government and members of the teaching staff , with the grounds that they had expressed in social media critical to the problems which were related to the deep in the country with the deep in the country .
in view of this , the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs is according to the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work as structural changes in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him progress has been a constant belt and take @-@ off . Jordan has managed a show for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it looks down blue , thought and spiritu@@ alised changes . it is sure that this changes took place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ ib dreamed , such as millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dreams of bringing his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to see them . &quot;
perhaps the region will be inspired by music , art and literature of a real and basic op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bombs , battle un@@ itions and artificial demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until far as far as it is , H@@ da@@ ib is ra@@ ging and resi@@ sted resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which is part of a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the trucks , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have survived , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force Em@@ ishi in his knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , therefore we have a great view .
one can imagine difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari .
I have long been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two sec@@ ts are straight to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only truth - and to spend their summer in this way :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ high fortress was unbelievable .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history , because they are helping to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ dress@@ ers .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug dealers are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region can not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to always give more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers who can re@@ build these applied hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the outer limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show , who can create the ec@@ cent@@ est lo@@ oms as you can see in the following video ( other videos about current compet@@ es are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to change young people on their weapons against hair tools and instead of bad advice to create an apprentices@@ hip in the hair@@ style of hair@@ style which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the end of March , and reported about some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , where@@ of we are very proud because of love to the children we have built this education community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the &quot; love message &quot; in gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel out to bring aff@@ ection ?
just this question was the two young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the head and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people signed with gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC &apos;s gu@@ err@@ illa movement , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was applied to the sig@@ nat@@ ory of peace agreement than so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its services .
however , in front of colum@@ n@@ em@@ akers , there is still a long way until one can talk about a real reconciliation , and from peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who lived for many years in illegal camps have been exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons were carried away , they must be re@@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , had used to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , these are now able to support them in their ranks and support them in the building of a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ ians had to join together with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in the company .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , which should then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for Camp@@ aign
the idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk just with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who we love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more constra@@ ined .
he plane , he continued to tell us this year his love with people who needed the most urgent addition .
so the plan was designed to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
to date , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that somebody would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to survive the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC stood up , as they had done before , to make the orders of their leaders .
but this time they were not given orders , but letters full of sub@@ s@@ ating of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political knowledge of Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after handed over the letters , a former fighter led me through the camps of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I entered into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa strug@@ gles live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because in the bed there was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Dor@@ n@@ rÃ¶@@ sch@@ laf .
and I asked him , &apos; H@@ ello , what do they say ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , somebody has written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him , and sat down beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry for all those years of faithful companions of this fighting , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else expected of life than war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned just how I have to deal with weapons .
but now where peace is reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for the outs@@ et , students and leader of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion round .
the students were all grew up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already seen in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social in@@ justice had worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country .
for a target of this magn@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people still had to hear , who had never found hearing , and to recognize that the people I have seen often as a monster , and even hate only people with beautiful feelings that were turned by their life and their environment was painful for me .
the truth in which the country lives , hurt me .
but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed , and have done so much harm to give us something , and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the example of Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
Kolum@@ ba was prophes@@ ying that peace would reign after the dis@@ armament of peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will be always people who are willing to attack weapons and protest to their rights , and that &apos;s totally justified ( ... ) .
from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
this is why we invo@@ ke all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what breed , religion or ide@@ ology , they belong to all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , afford our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from my own experience that nothing is easy . to those who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homos@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Caucas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and stress .
in terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the people &apos;s LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not first emerged about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a tran@@ ss@@ exual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines before several months after reports published , which have been published the tow@@ ing , torture and murder of que@@ ens in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and woke them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was raised , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced by the gender equality of their land , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
she was afraid of fear for her life in the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ pers for a human rights organization .
one day was told me that somebody needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ lu@@ ous woman lying in difficulties .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone who thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . &quot; then there is no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round on What@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just doing some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned myself , I felt somewhat in my body , but I hurt nothing .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honour the family , you love ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and awake at the hospital at the hospital .
apparently , some women had to get everything and started scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February , I got a threats .
they called to me , wrote to me - relatives , foreigners , some entirely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove to prove it up without the streets ; others , that I had not changed in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have body size C - what could I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tried to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said to my mother in the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic .
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she got a rope around his neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark@@ ened window slices and a number plate with a number of 95 .
after the third time it happened , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy .
my Human Rights @-@ Friends reviewed the Num@@ bers - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I will not give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without order to register , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the tr@@ ash .
arrived at and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a foreig@@ ner .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you were in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you tick . you even know your p@@ imm@@ ern@@ ess .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was indeed my p@@ imm@@ ern@@ ess .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , however , this is a theme theme .
some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements , I still bear in me .
so very much I wish it , this wild barrier can &apos;t overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I really give it trouble to look like the person who remembers them from their past , so remember my male form .
but it is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the present situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked with someone who has one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that while Ram@@ ad@@ an was not arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this , I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood gen@@ ug@@ ation .
OC Media : are men now even gay men in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says that there wasn &apos;t very many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives , or who were left from their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present themselves later as terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base .
understand you ?
as if these people not simply disappeared , but targeted , to radic@@ alise itself .
OC Media : is this only a guess or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I quote someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply have taken it .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was involved , when these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there were no reports until now . we suggest that such actions are possible .
why would you not allow this man to shave yourself ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who include a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization , &quot; but finally thrown back into the stone time .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted , I had coloured eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Security Ministry of Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , mainly on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole town knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ asing : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it often says to children when they are doing about crane .
OC Media : so they simply shut up their eyes before you , because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never have insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted , and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long kept this gifts time ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row joined the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality .
he didn &apos;t talk about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had lived and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic is steadily slow@@ ed .
OC Media : what activities do you go after ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA not much .
apart from that , I still worked as a activist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I agree with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , mer@@ ging , I have committed them to hospital and help them to get eating tickets .
I have no p@@ enny for it .
I discovered these people myself , as I cli@@ cked a curse .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ er@@ ly .
so nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that &apos;s exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who wish you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no gay in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have what Cab@@ ar@@ din@@ er have , which Russians also have , on all planets there is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear something .
I meet here as many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslim who go to the mosque and , during Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love men , and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ ste@@ er .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different habit@@ settings .
for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I &apos;m now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab A@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
for the past few months , there is a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i came back on 27 August the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra near Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered during anxiety , depression , and he em@@ itted for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to come up for his family , so Ah@@ mad human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
on YouTube , a video grab@@ bing the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people manage it quickly to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , they were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only one of suicide in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists in front war@@ n that there would still be more men that could take life .
the Ah@@ mad Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing common : they were all family members , who felt like persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to work on a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , based on a large part of the Arab A@@ w@@ azi community living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and made major efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy in the whole Iran .
in the A@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the past oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most valuable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illness , hunger and kidn@@ apping .
the Iranian regime ref@@ uses the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arab citizens systematically in the local area of oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of twi@@ men , the water of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and gh@@ om are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dro@@ ught , and to destroy local agriculture and fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian youth now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director for Collabor@@ ative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ is , who seek a job , finished elementary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and have a university degree of 45 % .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ mad men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become even worse . the reason for this , a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z are new to ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions are pre@@ fers to adjust Arab labour force , the local Arab A@@ w@@ azi will escape access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside of their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancest@@ or , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabian clothing .
in view of the given circumstances that have to bear Arab ancest@@ or , human rights activists strike the alarm before the situation explo@@ sives .
it remains to wait , whether the world is awake and taking knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .
you can obtain assistance in confi@@ dential emergency hot@@ lines for suicide vulner@@ able and people in emotional crises .
to visit Bu@@ ri@@ fl@@ s.@@ org to find the telephone number of a suicide emergency hotline in your country .
&quot; why don &apos;t I uni@@ denti@@ fied myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ section not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed .
you can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women speak , especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fr@@ ust .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay a well thought of scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be a femin@@ ist * within .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite equal education than men .
that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it is about doing what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure there are women sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and familiar .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come on skin color , rac@@ ism , black C@@ is women , on black women from Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I chose to mention that kind of femin@@ ist , se@@ el@@ ically and verb@@ al , many white femin@@ ists settled in silence and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they all agree that women - all women - come together to raise &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya &quot; to sing , &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , an institutional form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are subjected to black women to two times .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and origin spend less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ her@@ es and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the other hand , I want all the women , all males and all men who have neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to consider the un@@ righteousness in their thinking , which relate both to gender and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and I &apos;m not going to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that always has rejected me and countless other black women forever .
in 1851 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which can also absorb our customs and customs to advance their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric programme .
I will not attempt to get white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women a home and to settle down from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to join me full and completely from femin@@ ism and to join me from femin@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly , that interfer@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we define black women looking for our own ideas and give us into the sp@@ her@@ es , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana ur@@ an@@ ism : how we will defend ourselves , in which we can defend ourselves on our own way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be denied .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separat@@ ist and margin@@ alization as they have read these lines , please tell you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because I have existed in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I will be recognised as a part of this para@@ dig@@ mas due to my dark skin and because of my life as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life had neither escaped , nor ignored , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ing against pollution : the mission of a man , to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
we traveled to Nabil Mus@@ a in the past 7 years - usually with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to its church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; tells Mus@@ a .
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which uses to protect the rivers , streams and water flows in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the pressures and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmmaker and multi @-@ media journalist , produced , filmed and published .
the focus of her work is based on a little remarkable sub@@ cultures and is characterised by using co@@ operative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help to tell municipalities that can tell their stories their way .

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to the protection of the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their own partner who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship , some time was passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was demonstrated because of abuse , there is also no use of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez .
a few days later , the second woman moved back their ad .
to break the devil , violence against women is difficult .
when women do not refund at all , they are generally not receiving support from the state .
in many cases the women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to have victims of violence , at all at the prosecution authorities .
In@@ durable 1 stro@@ kes and Stati@@ stical Bulletin 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ uses and a legal system that does not work any under@@ lying 3 of the laws : good approach , defective re@@ cover@@ ings and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women really mis@@ uses , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher of Gen@@ der@@ asks , Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the numbers below are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the District Court of At@@ tor@@ ney , there were 9@@ 600 read@@ ings for domestic violence . 70 % of them fell by violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peac@@ ekeeping . 86 % of the ads came out here .
in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics show not the true magn@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these off@@ ences are actually displayed in fact . &quot; on any woman who ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of mental abuse , 9 women will not do this .
in any woman , which are ref@@ unded due to physical abuse , two women , which do not do this , &quot; stated at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a perpet@@ ual off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot be documented appropriate , as many women are murdered each year from their current or former partners .
only until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country alone .
in Paraguay , co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay was documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible mist@@ re@@ ments and a legal system that does not under@@ go
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then . this should always be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she bore psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , recogni@@ zing the most severe :
I have never thought that I would be victim of abuse .
when I read earlier this , I thought that only women happen to refra@@ in because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the ab@@ uses of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote articles on Facebook , in which they described his accus@@ ations and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them isolated .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen so long from Carlos and didn &apos;t left him earlier .
it seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , was fighting almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mist@@ re@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to strike them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as Advert@@ is@@ ements in the authorities stopped without earnings and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly for money , power and the influence of their former partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
the failure of ab@@ uses is a road full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great issues in use of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , the draft law was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # FÃ¼r@@ sten@@ ance ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Easy L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks ahead , Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain to an independent off@@ ense , and harder to pun@@ ish as it is in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
so the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points , in order to win the MPs for the law , feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions which currently being banned in Paraguay are generally forbidden to be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the bill of bill provided that the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process cost , which need to carry out the victims of violence at present themselves , if they simply want to receive , and maintain a safe accommodation to im@@ pose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri , argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ature has no sufficient financial resources available :
in Paraguay fail@@ ures are seen as part in human relationships .
here , there must be a re@@ thinking that violence is no longer considered a little Nordic .
those who keep silent in view of this facts are guilty , and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators are gone away .
we need to refund so long , until fail@@ ures do not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , parts of the law was cancelled , which the partners were kn@@ itted in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes are apart .
the section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ressor , to attack his victims .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continue to assault on attacks
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the information Minister , &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served one year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before the court , but later returned .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , which led by a state of state .
since then he was clothed in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the principal offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ ans of Sultan is characterized by the be@@ har@@ ming efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , the public relations , including press freedom , limit and human rights def@@ ender , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities systematic peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , making their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inc@@ eption in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , released a article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to the title &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties . in this , it went to corruption in the Ju@@ di@@ st and the interference from high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the German editorial committee , was charged at the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the Deputy Editor @-@ editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who moved to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as chief editor .
the newspaper was closed on uncertain time after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dissemin@@ ation of the newspaper on every way , including online , will be forbidden on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
the first negoti@@ ation in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j both were convicted for the disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of injury of a ban and s@@ lander for crimes .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a year @-@ old professional ban was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of money in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of an information network for spreading material which could be a risk for public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a deposit was set at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgement of imprisonment .
the Appeals Court spoke Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was sentenced to the prison sentence of his six months in prison on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees the newspaper according to attacks by the Cuban government .
on 8 January the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister filed a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman at the youngest time .
further injuries include the closure of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put into operation .
due to the closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the press freedom of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and release unconditional ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n to create their work in their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country , and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ ending human rights and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered her right human rights @-@ work and without fear of re@@ jection measures , including gr@@ ass@@ essments .
the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit organisation and non @-@ governmental organization to defend human rights violations ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peac@@ efully , supported and protection to them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need on site medical research there are two reasons : in the offer of global healthcare industry , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover special medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widespread consequences in the poo@@ rest countries of Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investment for research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists itself , helps building its own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Central Committee on the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic first showed a serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself asked the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and on mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media on these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I supported the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
besides , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always keep recipi@@ ents instead of being mo@@ vers .
the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or go here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you haven &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have continuous supply with electricity , water and Internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : how is public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students all ages .
there are need of special scientific training , starting in any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( not transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , there are limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that journ@@ als are accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how to change &quot; open source &quot; seed producers in global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine published about solvents for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 types , such as out@@ red@@ ders , the first plant grown by NASA &apos;s ast@@ ron@@ aut in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was placed only by his own objec@@ tion@@ ing and the question of how many salads he can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a specific rot@@ or or green leaves .
over the past few years , more and more of such patents have been registered , such as grain or cart@@ ograph@@ ers . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food safety ensure the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on still maintains salad , however , however , it takes longer because his work is still worth more restrictions .
&quot; it is when in a river a rock are lying around which I must p@@ addle .
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far .
and when they stand before the court , no one can breed more a new sal@@ at@@ ry , because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants .
however , it is very careful , however , to use no material which is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is always larger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have bred red sk@@ etch of the variety of out@@ red@@ ders in the &quot; greenhouse gas station &quot; and eaten . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that , when the movement from the IT area should come and do not come from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
she was called to life in order to ensure that some plant species and are not being protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bre@@ eders is permanently usable .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders is committed to under@@ take that others can be able to use seed freely from them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to sell business and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder can only allow others to breed their seed , so that it is forbidden to avoid such a variety - two aspects that are forbidden through many plant pat@@ ente .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark views
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seeds plays a role in larger relations like Bi@@ odiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try not to use the latter not or only little use by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified , or not , in order to buy our goal of environmental sustainability , the most recent examples of lin@@ ings of chemicals and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , as it is offered to farmers markets , should also know that the way is bred on farms , such as these vegetables is being far@@ med .
food confident people without seed @-@ confident people is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to provide others their seed still free of charge . thus , their approach is to be patented in contrast , seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is endangered , since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is always restricted by restriction .
Claire Lu@@ by , the German language director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked with genetic variation on carrots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all boxes features are protected as intellectual property , making it either possible for plant bre@@ eders , either not or is worth only .
there are not such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in still larger style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ iting
plants are cultivated as far@@ med that they have targeted features - from such , through which their taste or their color improves until this , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and keep threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing as much more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently more constra@@ ined than ever before , since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also important for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States set up the company for the conservation of genetic diversity .
she contradic@@ ts that intellectual property of other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and protection of plant variations innovations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expired .
often , these statements help others to come with another method .
such protection in@@ hib@@ its innovation not , but promotes them to be provided with the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent loop , certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you could have lost the battle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources always have been a general good and could continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incenti@@ ves are not attractive to us .
we want farmers easier for farmers .
this is what we drive , and it will be impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on does not inter@@ fere with the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the features itself .
plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ State Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who bred a variety , also breeding his own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tural tures , for which cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides need to be needed , breeding in his varieties of this concept in agriculture .
my concept is very imagin@@ able . &quot;
while a few medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it will enable most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patented or they hold it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
Frank Mort@@ on &apos;s independent plant bre@@ eders is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders by the avo@@ ids of plant patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies who patented .
I need to constantly create new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years old , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you &apos;re protected for 20 years ahead of competition , where@@ with my opinion it just makes it easy . &quot; worldwide Reson@@ ance
although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept will now spread rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes themselves as professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; plant . to maintain the seed of traditional crops , the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports it , to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell her own .
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from land to land , absent due to the O@@ ss@@ i commitment not one to one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conventi@@ on@@ ally far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents to conventional far@@ med plants .
there is no explanation , however , not a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems in Ethiopia , based on farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards preser@@ vation of seed crops .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for the Open Source &quot; Program for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed systems that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; plant @-@ up systems for which the plan to fall next year .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( among them H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to plant seed and biodiversity around the world around Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map to publish a plant map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - it represents that farmers have to come to come to seed and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply may be ensured with food products .
in the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a variety , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will see him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is mainly gro@@ unded , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the principal Network for Human Rights Information ble@@ aching in spite of this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend this goal , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the blocking , and not to admit it . we hope to keep our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web@@ side bul@@ lets fell victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
next to AN@@ HR@@ I also exists on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sten and Human Rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of Columbus and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he addressed to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ate of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
blog@@ ger , the provider in which Zi@@ adas blog is home , on the other hand , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces when he reported about the student protests and recorded a video as the police exercise physical violence against two students .
his article are mainly turning around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this signi@@ fies for him :
to lock blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the lock is not important for the world , then it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has managed to give me the feeling of a siege insur@@ rection ; an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the national Security Council , the lock blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an impact , even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to handle c@@ ens@@ orship .
but now , after having locked it , and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ cus walk the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities blocked the technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE documented the blocking of providers , through the revers@@ ing of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we realized how to offer the locking of websites , which began V@@ P@@ N@@ s .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation will include , in addition , that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ination decisions can be met behind worn doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction before the court may take action against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants must fight .

daily newspaper reports from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous Post@@ card designs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro were murdered , &quot; &quot; Di@@ thi@@ eves the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ plates sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air @-@ air to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ ded financial situation , the threshold of 2017 reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the United Nations &apos;s Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
so , for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 , the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to establish a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision stated the paper :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ ver@@ ts , etc . everything that happens from the civi@@ lized standard , and what is only in Rio , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we don &apos;t close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Chief Editor of the Newspaper that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ d@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video there is a journalist in the newspaper that there are 8@@ 43 territories according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories .
in the Editorial , the Newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , even if it is dist@@ orted , gr@@ am@@ ities of the police , which only shoot and then asks questions to disgu@@ ise .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners .
does the name &quot; War &quot; do more than it use ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il argu@@ ed the journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , the journalist of C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , argu@@ ing that this was a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could be difficult to ste@@ er the responsibility of the police force .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , enligh@@ ten@@ ment and historical and self @-@ pleasing neglec@@ t of public service .
reminder : the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as a &quot; non @-@ violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are within the north and north east of the country . these are the most recent available data .
no such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we see the murders per state , Rio is on rank 16 , &quot; she writes .
an extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , emphas@@ ises such as C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly been repe@@ ating the State policy of the State since years .
for these security policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the police unit , used by the state of Rio in 2003 , aimed at conqu@@ ering the fav@@ ela of a massive police offering and in@@ corporate a unit to permanently .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death . for some years , the U@@ PP was able to protect against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the following criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for human beings .
for this calls for the State , funds and ways , which are typical for a war . this is the int@@ ru@@ sion of a &quot; enemy &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damages &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted balls . &quot;
war , or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio continues to suffer .
a week it is now that the police captured the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ om@@ m to av@@ enge the death of a police officers .
in the midst of all this violence also made head@@ lines : a fruit hi@@ ker died due to shame which had fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the research institute of the Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding land , Homs , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ li@@ b is currently around one million Syrians at a state of siege .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly strong , where an attack on chemical weapons resulted in the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was pract@@ ised by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these have stood by rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led to the inhabitants that residents were drawn up or provided by tun@@ nels and control points .
due to the lon@@ gla@@ sting block@@ ade , traditional food stuffs like meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ sings as they can plant their own fung@@ us as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and lead the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , her food @-@ food makes them an attractive food source for many people of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French News Agency ( AFP ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that we have been fighting for three years now and pushed his relief , that it now wins more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near as the humanitarian funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to con@@ vey 125 families of knowledge to decor@@ ate mushrooms , such as L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations in Can@@ Do Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , locally sour@@ ced materials are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eila told Global Vo@@ ices that they began working with the &quot; production of the regions of pilgrims &quot; before they checked their quality , and whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; apprenti@@ ce court for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us from different reasons &quot; : breakdown of siege .
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread of a culture of self supply by food remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) are used for extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible .
we want our experience to help people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people protest on 21 October in many districts of capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people were killed and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led the government last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region , where there were 4 dead in the region .
it is estimated that more than 500 fire out@@ breaks took place in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o was res@@ ett@@ led a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings , in Portugal alone approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture from Ernst the location : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fore@@ se@@ eable tragedy
the protests of Saturday was the demand for better relief and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people questioned why the civil protection was not able to conv@@ ene the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al declared the federal government of the farmers from Portugal the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o declared :
in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o &apos;s streets and villages have been evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would happen again as in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits are stored in est@@ r@@ ities with a high fire of bran@@ dy .
a far proposal on the forest form , which had brought the government to severe fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was assigned by the municipalities , who saw new rules as an obst@@ acle for investment .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applicant had any means of funds for self @-@ protection , that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; says JoÃ£o Sor@@ val further from the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it attentive to spread large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , as far as in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of this species continues to spread .
this is also added to these problems that the website of the civilian population of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents were looking for information or tried to contact the members offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they use their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt application and informed the population in real time over the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was put on this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the servers followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users that followed the fires , the site counted more than half a million requests .

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

during a night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , which had defeated short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
just at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more .
the boy was to break down in the morning of dawn .
his uncle would pick him up and kill him .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominant party of the b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was assassin@@ ated just by the Taliban and suddenly felt many Haz@@ ara suddenly .
the Taliban were getting closer to their hatred for the Haz@@ ara known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara fors@@ ook the country in direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself back in Pakistan .
he worked in a co@@ leg@@ ation for a few years . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went into Iran again . once again he was found in a strange country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ar which were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
back then , as today , the Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; I remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we worked also .
there was no facilities there and no heating . we hanging nylon before the open window , so that we don &apos;t let it at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af in the homeless alone , walked through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day on meals .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for long @-@ term asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find asylum seek@@ ers in the country is dis@@ astro@@ us .
the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special admission centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission center , if they officially put an application for asylum - what can be submitted for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers .
until then , people who have no money for a stay , either on the hospitality of friends , or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ wanted lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after he had made various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af invaded the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so well that he opened a second hostel after a while , and opened a bar@@ bell .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now the subject of documentation &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of directors Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan created companies , including cutting parties , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience in which the Kell@@ ner and the kitchen staff mostly have refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of restaurants tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome also stand Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go far beyond the Italian restaurants and the retail , and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave out as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country , and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same ways like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also plans plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packing and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest@@ ing on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubts , but the end is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afghanistan in this way .
