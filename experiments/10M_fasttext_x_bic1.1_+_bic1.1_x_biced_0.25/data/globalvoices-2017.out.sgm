<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, read American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly known for an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who had covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to face the Supreme Court of Justice who wanted to increase his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the United States had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very low love story about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the tourism and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and approved in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won with the Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigie person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to be in accordance with people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalistic program, people from all over the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I managed to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with the present editor of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Inolerance also stands in contrast to generosity which I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues, to accustomed us to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embodied my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump joins his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, they sent me a stop and the equivalent to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out to be the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The idea of the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared either his racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to oversee these things, nearly broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump-voters as a cassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">People submit to people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about hectic changes in their communities cannot be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most knows are, for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they would perhaps say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (ante.): as much as "rejection of the White against all other ethnicities," Vocabulary from white into the White and Whiplash, what is so much means like chandeltrauma), as it called the great Van Jones, has exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise and says: to Hell with verseness, freedom of religion and the concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again on the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration in Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your United States?" Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud voice "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Latinos have a seat in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your United States? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"if any man, who is not like you, has a place in your United States?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan completed his words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find any more in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean town of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both locations does not only change the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the apostasy</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists, but worlds away from the nearby magnificent ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years, La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has now been playing in the village: a symphony orchestra, which has found its musical instruments to overcome them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drugs abuse and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental meeting with a French pilot that launched a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to meet her great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always get laughing and with shining eyes and play in the turkey you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the kids of Cateura - a village that is practically above the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the Paraguay capital - on instruments which are made of retracting waste materials:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restored instruments which consist of local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez started to transform parts of the case into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments include violins, violets, celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombone and percussion that were all manufactured from the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local edeologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, remembered the beginning of time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First of all, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio changed anything, which he had never seen before: one out of trash produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a complete orchestra, which plays on instruments made of reprepared material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Each year the world generates approximately one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live by him are the troubles - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Land Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational drama of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing companies</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing is fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry was written by Emma Bryce, originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted via international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for shared content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberia before it was seeking the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly applied accordingly, and inclined little inclined to welcome a burglar of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised quickly against the ship. they refused him to share one of their ports and refused to share a fisherman's concession.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier was surround about countries that you simply refused," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and followed." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled out of the waters of the region: it was not managed to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminals and protect resources, FISH-i Africa was founded: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network were driven out of six countries, which at that time had been driven out of their waters at the time.</seg>

<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is concealed because of it is extremely difficult to view, it is illegal fishing a main cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the estimated disregard of existing laws which should be protected by the particular habitats and types, illegal fishing ecosystems, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during actions against illegal fishing once were handicapped through bureaucratic obstacles, and also through the worm-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange the lists of existing licenses, news of suspicious activities or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when moving these on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to characterize ships which fish in banned areas - such as such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideals, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries, which are against illegal fishing, can refuse to refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo as in the case of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>

<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a berber company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already known platform was created to gain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishermen penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing boats, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. amongst these, even those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">To their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying Phantasienames, fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>

<seg id="124">Yet another country could say 'Come to me'. "and precisely this legale hole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found fleeing ships and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations show us quite far in the networks of organized crime "," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that can help FISH-i, suspicious ships in precise locations.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be enhanced, helps to cover the illegal vessels that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the Illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO which also works with fisheries and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be purchased by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is helping to build a system which connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One program model</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's Team African nations actually affect the wrong global issue of illegal fishing companies?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "" Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are evidence that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that fished previously without licensing and hardly to calculate consequences, know that they are obtainable.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating FISH-i had a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats have more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 found the inspectors there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member states could report its first major triumph in Somalia: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship which was under wrong flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing.</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They apply as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum for the President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela has rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum, the Venzolans reacted, in whose eyes were negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were assembled on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the back of Venezuela) allow both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among others in the lowlands of Barinas, in the Andenregio MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in central-north, the state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Easa.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, resulting in everyday life of Venetians through an acute lack of food and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the Opposition saw in the tenure of the current president NicolÃ¡s Maduro as a chance for a fundamental change; however, finally, the posture of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-effective at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government statement as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated to be 500% on the financial statements) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to be the chance to withdraw its institutional structures and close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The alliance of Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (about: round Table of the Democratic Unity), joined by the opposition to the support of the National Assembly, which was planned on October 27th as well as a march to Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, on November 3, should continue to continue the blocking of the referendums to the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is far as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday national strike, and on November 3 all after Caracas to Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">The first demonstration in the context of the action programme "The retreat of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, 26 October.</seg>
<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches which are published in real time, testify to other things a overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with police officers and advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstrators, who calls through the protective signs: "will you kill me, because I am hungry?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter there are images that tell of disputes, as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the central-north city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There, protesters return to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral again, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the AndenState TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira have no skirts, because you could see something that could not have many nationalities!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an Infographic is already making a round that forms the extent of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">So the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the claim after a official statement - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs are:</seg>
<seg id="186">NicolÃ¡s and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">This is your tenure!</seg>

<seg id="189">Other protests as a further step in the fight against a government, which has undertaken a little against the disastrous economic crisis, and more preferable to have critical voices to the disastrous:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The fairytale always take more of frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="208">I could not recognize that my father was a thief, folterer and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarerieofficials. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was a deputy commander of the Secret Services Division 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows, which great power has a parent over his child, and as this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had a young boy, the martial arts made me.</seg>
<seg id="217">All known him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and urged me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a asshole, you were friends with one from the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they do not have a day to escape you, and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party.</seg>
<seg id="223">So he forbade me again to go to the Sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be obeyed.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had taken me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy the papers that heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university inclusions, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'there the prisoners are tortured.'</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first time and last time he was waiting at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he commanded me to get out. he led me to a barracks, in cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small wrapped pbread, and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a big clump silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were removed and undertook me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he clarifies an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in, and saw a song, tortured on people.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They grabbed a man of handcuffs on the bed, shed him with water, and pursued him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The ank there was horrible... like a dirty Windel.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and carrying eyes.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who also was indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses where naked people were down with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance, people were silent on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed I looked at the prisoners, he said, "Why do you look so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I said, "Why have you brought me anything else?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were killed and buried in a pit, and were buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this, because my father told her home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero smashed a man and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to the survivors of the civilian, Jorge Romero, who also was indicted in La Perla-Ribera Trial, was also indicted by students RaÃºl Mateo Molina.</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video, Emilio Fessia, the leader of the Memorial La Perla, led by the former torture chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The path that you came in here is also the way where the kidnap came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When you look at the map, you see that they took about this route and tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here, their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of unloading a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of above came to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was a lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of human beings and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all the stolen things to home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war trophies" - as they knew it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war trophies are a bayonet or perhaps military signs which one has to be fought against an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one goes into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then it is not a war of war but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">That is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked myself, how my father, the head of security forces, could bring with this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I simply don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal, and I said, And you, whom you walk on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded anger, crying me, crying, crying,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, I'll find you and bring you down.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need any others!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the trial, I showed a photo of that time, on which I wore a jacket and a roll-out pullover from wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothing to home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defence accused me to have been a member of this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay me to burden what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to say.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the corpse is the last aburous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I feel remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you are only children, you recognize the value of a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further, and recognizes that it is false to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">So well, you were exiled during the dictatorship, but why the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children escape?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father brought a girl with home, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could just be put into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill those people. but why do their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people do not have families who were able to pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last aburous act, which one can do a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to eliminate the mortal remnants of prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were grind and somewhere - no idea where. "one will never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything will always remain.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i have seen how you killed men! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to say it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, signify my father, was created during a conversation he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all of the atrocities that I had to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said, "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt so ridiculous and asked me why the whole exaggerated patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings" were supposed to defend them, actually well.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I shouted:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me what to me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed men!</seg>
<seg id="318">You committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only said "Na then show me."</seg>
<seg id="320">Exactly what did I do.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I received the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally knew that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can imagine that I am pre-shot. I finally said to my own father.</seg>
<seg id="324">Luis Alberto Quijano died under house arrest in May 2015 standing before the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="325">He was indicted for 416 criminal charges: among them heavier, unjustifying freedom of freedom in 158 cases, murder in 98 cases, murder in 98 particularly severe cases, torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidnapping of one under 10 years of child.</seg>

<seg id="328">The judgments in the "megacausa"</seg>
<seg id="329">The term "megacausa" refers to the magnitude of the judgement.</seg>
<seg id="330">After four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard, the historic La Perla-Ribera Trial committed the crimes against 716 victims because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978.</seg>
<seg id="331">43. he was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death sentences in 28 cases and sentenced in nine cases in prison sentences between 2 and 14 years. in six cases there were no release.</seg>
<seg id="332">Eleven of originally 54 defendants died during the process.</seg>

<seg id="334">All defendants were members of the military, including former military personnel, former police belonging and civil staff.</seg>

<seg id="336">He established the following words to the silent Chamber:</seg>
<seg id="337">La Perla was a death factory designed by inhuman heads.</seg>
<seg id="338">The court part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations, who have worked for many years in justice for victims.</seg>
<seg id="339">Claudio Orosz, the lawyer of the Argentine organization H.I.J.O.S., founded in 1995, represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared, said:</seg>
<seg id="340">The process took more than three years, but research took 39 years.</seg>

<seg id="343">A translation errors makes elderly people in Kyoto too "fearful motorists"</seg>
<seg id="344">The sign with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto, where you can prolong his driving licence.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was disseminated in social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Processing of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers have been renewing a newly opened centre in which you can prolong his driving licence, in the last month witnesses a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">In a sign, the Japanese word is supportable by the Japanese word (kountensha), which means "older drivers" means, maybe - but perhaps also with malignant backgrounds, and # 8212; as "fearful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was read on electronic ads on the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">The processing of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was often shared into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was a translator, Julian Holmes, a resident Kyotos, and he was also that the Lokalids carefully made it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun's Kyoto Protocol wrote in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was initially removed. it was later replaced by the "fearful motorists" (German: "horrible motorists") was later replaced by the appropriate designation "Elder Drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police in the Kyoto prefecture were apologized for the translation errors. furthermore, they stated that the error was already checked in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked in their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we're sorry that elderly people felt by insufficient correction (the translation) of our part," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-cast News sat a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "fearful" older drivers in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are involved, but definitely for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture for example, in 2005 1.941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by senior citizens. this represents a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus, their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has dropped in total, the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period increased.</seg>
<seg id="366">The nament non-known reporters brought comments on the release of the article comments on the light that show the prejudices some Japanese seemingly against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation errors received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" terrible drivers ") isn't that reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "Is the translation actually not really, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">- "I don't think that it's a real translation mistake."</seg>
<seg id="371">There are no few that comments.</seg>
<seg id="372">Why "Engrish" is so common in Asia</seg>
<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">Engrish.com website is a true mine for these bizarre mistakes in English.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For example, one requires two important skills: passive language skills to understand the preparation and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active behaviours of the target language - something that is in case of motherly language. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French native language should translate as an example of English in French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language that could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding, quotations, or the relatively small number of English speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees have to make translations yet firmeninternally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator yet. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, among them also the enigmatic prints that are often used T-shirts or bags are only used for stylistical reasons - not to be read or understood at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable, or at least harmless. but of large companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the City of Kyoto uses a serial source for their translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and travel measures on the Internet and television take part</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, April 7th, Venezuelan Internet users have no access to the Vivoplay online transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that Internet access will not be accessible from VPITV and El Capitolio TV.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcaster contributed to the protests of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositional groups who resist the NicolÃ¡s Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court himself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is caught, and recommended the Users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages Venezuelan providers are once locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitated for protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission was threatened with cash prizes and closure, when they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative television channels I have registered at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing, that's still cheaper than to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the domain name (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that local internet providers are using DNS at times. this is a technique to answer the DNS servers of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds incorrect or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elbow oliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transfer was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV-cameraman Elvis Flores who transferred the protests in Caracas live in custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later, he was released, and VPITV was resumed.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government is regulated by the Internet connections: in order to continue the access to multi-media coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay many girls become a slave to get a training</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a child in Criadita. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimonials of other Criaditas, which were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use with friendly permission of turally.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report of turally, published by Global Voices with friendly authorization of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series with the title "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("lying cows, falling schools"), edited by Global Voices Latin America and is rereleased.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where they did not live together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her degree in the university, she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">The one has become something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas one denotes the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a big family with little money, gives her minderous son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for this countless days of housework that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse of abuse, and all that can not lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">In Paraguay, this as Criadazgo is widely distributed in Paraguay due to involvement and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In doing so, she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, cherished and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, for the feeling of gratitude to be vaccinated the Criaditas, is generally consistent in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">The Criadazgo is based on a double deception, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the other hand, the family, who will close their daughter in faith, making it possible to improve their position in society and make something out of itself, "to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes up the girl with itself and whose exploitation was justided with the belief that they would not get a chance, who would not get an apprenticeship and might even be starred.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is mistreated, his family will be experienced only many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experienced them.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in paraguayischen households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of violent strikes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military camp TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a official name at the residents of the company.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived at their home in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants, 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira moved with a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They showed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted practice of Criadazgo for death of the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest reports and demanded that there were no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control among which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations demanded an independent investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want that TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to death.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case before the court comes, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay, a case of Criadazgo is coming from court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as a workforce; they are also isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik in which her father worked to register the bankruptcy and lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all, and began to sell on the street or on the market of sweets to make money.</seg>

<seg id="462">They rose up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, it cleaned the fridge, cleaning the living room, polished furniture and disinfect the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they had finished with learning, the more leisure time it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because she had to make dinner for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had to never starve, but got not unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the house of the house as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the householder, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="474">It was, however, totally clear that she had paid them for everything she had paid for them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school, Alvarenga discriminates. "a matter about which almost never spoken is Mobbing and the Schikans, to which Criaditas are exposed to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognise that someone who has no parents, is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite you to home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Posted in Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary report submitted a bill to "the regulatory systems in regard to the use and commercial social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If he is accepted by Parliament, users of social media must register in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, then a place would be set up, which means that, citizens and citizens should use a permit to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register users and users at the site of the site with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it failed to do this, that could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and of Egypt, defines social media as "jedwede application that is running and used through the Internet and communicate with others using voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is set through, since the design is no indication of it, as Egyptian authorities are supposed to make the registration for users who don't register, considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, member of Parliament and sponsors of the Legislative Law, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and a password to come through the firewall, which blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">That could mean that Egypt plans to set a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technical Officer (based on German "Senior Research Institute") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), declared Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubted greatly to the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they could control physical public and private spaces, as well as they could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, it means that they can apply a strong surveillance system to charge citizens who want to apply a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to bring it to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not so realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Legislative Assembly and the Constitutional System before entering the debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military monument in parliament, in which the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration on the image is present," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the Tamer El-ShaHawaiy proposed a lawsuit against cyber crime in which a life imprisonment for those who were intended to threaten the "public order of threatening" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High above in the mountains of Kurdistan in northeastern Iraq work the animal welfare Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-government organisation Nature Iraq, to protect the Irish leopard Leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of Leopards, who, through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are because of wilderei, loss and fragmentation of their life and they always find less spoils.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of Leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video shows, "is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the thought of the ecosystem depends on that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually is low and goes towards zero. when the team ensures a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza broke out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza is passionate about a different side of their country that exists not only from war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field trials for wild animals since six years and has been involved in Nature Conservation for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the liberal daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the northeastern Japan have been achieved to rebuild the lives of those who have been affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in the Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture in Japan's Northeast prefecture - both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring cities of Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows that progress for six years later, to rebuild the life of the local community.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (subject to sales, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to list the greatest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the scheduled spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, we are still striving to be evacuated by the evacuation of Behelfs.Comforsake, Kazetsu juutaku) to settle in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in living accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency, whereas Miyagi was successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster has been moved into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of works and daily life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung could determine, 1074 out of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune, their doors will return to December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, only 30 percent of fisheries have recovered their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, moved into compassion in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 hectares of cultivated fields of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear plywood."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovering again, but here Fukushima still remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 per cent at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima still can feature only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuated by. she asked them of the status of reconstruction and, as you can find themselves opposite the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey was that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that still not enough were done in disasters with disasters.</seg>
<seg id="575">Just as it stands for those who are evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, disaster-causing, nuclear accident, the Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to territories outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016 a little more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, have been moved to permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated communities are more than 50 years old. they have to be more than 50 years old because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima are competing with massive construction projects. this is about building projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people met people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be bigger than the common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, one often acknowledges that one more connects than it seems to look at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they demand our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately ultimately became very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this sequence of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely this global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal subjects that often get fewer attention when they earn less attention than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Kriconi talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Toreta Camarasa talks about how the love of music worked out in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time where they worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back to his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33, this week was delivered to the intensive care station: last Friday a police officer was defeated at GoiÃ¢nia in a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the university university GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractions.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors accredited him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as a critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the face of the police officers, who was identified with a strike attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the investigation was suspended from active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he proposes in GoiÃ¢nia and his strike on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer had cheated by demonstrators and landing at the intensive care station, his face would be six months long on TV and the whole suppression would be justified.</seg>

<seg id="606">In the bottom of the clip, one sees the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family, who lives in another state of state, Internet users have donated some 10,000 Brazilian Reais (approximately 2,700 Euros) to meet a part of the cost of medical treatment and to make his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia, while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls further violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s in memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist police have been assassinated by his father, because he was sabotaging the Occupy Movement in Sekeus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police station after he had been attacked by a policemen who hit him with a strike.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police transfer</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil where he came to protesters on the last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were put on protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters had built a stage for Redner, Gummigeschke and TrÃ¤nengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media street protested by pressing the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo reported targeted via a cerebral glass windows to illustrate with a photo their cover pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred a title story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken window disc than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must recognize, if you are striving against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Also here, the term "Vandalism" receives a absurd, excessive importance, and the typical violence of the military police will overcome by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontational course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Those of the uninduced forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">The introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The public church Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - that there is no notable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane were lahmated.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the earth, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some rarely changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commutes daily to factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo envying on each day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugarcane industry do not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in the eastern region of sugarcane factories, which after long-active time in operation, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers us to have heard that in MaÃ±alich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the bad administration decisions, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvesting are no more new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the village saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was a economic necessity: 155 sugarcane factories were technically reobsolete, and hardly competitive, they were inconceivable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, by the OECD and FAO, by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and nutrition organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the day of today's day will go into history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructure began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the disclosure of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, over 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, the word that he is most repeated, "betrayal."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all surveyed said: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first anniversary year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which would only be removed from parts that would be removed, the address at the date and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulan Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was over and the letters came more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the disclosed factory for two years, and he was one who received letters. "the country had no money for the factory in operation."</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the disclosure of the factory, in whose construction he helped, involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording of a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youths from the First Nations Communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do they do by hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour we have been running mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres, to accommodate youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten crews-communities and then working with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop increases with the fact that the young participants in our conversations on issues such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance" or whatever makes them in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youth are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women have disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey as important of obtaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people will not always rule the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved a little help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop-Group who gave them a verse in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookside of N'we Jinan, the verse verse is available, as well as translation into English, which is translated into English here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel, nobody ever would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to walk my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will betray our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way to life in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise us one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So you can grow and go ahead of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do what they intended for the creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part of the readers and supporters of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in silverside (which is also published on his blog and is re-published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes at almost any restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers, what exactly is on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (nature, nature, "Plastic models of the courts") from each food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at this plastic dishes and decide if they enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even strive them all. however, a new trend is transformed into current mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matoms published the blogger itinii range of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new with plastic ribbed frame tapes, as shown in Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shot refrigerators magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the food provisions is becoming increasingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a cave-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part is also produced for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing occasion into the Komische.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and cell designer allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular topping that will be served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetizing form to surprise your colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the form of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and hand tapes from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can watch further skurrile plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter on the hashtag # attention.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then you'll find a glimpse of the Kappabashi neighborhood which is dedicated to the exposure of the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes can actually be produced.</seg>
<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for victims of struggle against drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "struggle against drug dealers" in Mexico, the mixes and geared regularly dives only in statistics. however, this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of the Sinaloa box, pressed the stories of the victims of conflict entirely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, barely any one looks at the dream or to the municipalities that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone and in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds perhaps never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico is the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with the drug trading"), which is supposed to give a voice and tell stories of people living in the fight between prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear changes") tell exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who is seeking secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost their father to only one day her father, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have asked us to get rid of and to graves, according to the people who we loved are looking for."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never came back. "Emma Veleta:" it's very hard for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who also is with me here.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but it does not pay them out because you demand a mortality.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" editors, why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't just need to show the faces of those who are afraid. we need to show the international community conflicts, fragility, and state control.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have now known disease and sensation since some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come past every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which can actually come from a textbook for criminology, or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me from the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect toward the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be equal or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he's big. and it's not normal that people listen songs about the "heldentations" of the offender, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone who have lost, and those who fear them also something.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, if stories can be exposed in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The intimelessness of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village may be justified that they were "rise."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk about these tragedies, if they don't touch and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of pressors in the main city district:" she describes how an armed crime month was captured by her business until they had not only destroyed the store at the end, but also their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think all that you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again, if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">The habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it's absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kill or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, if weeping was my profound feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the contribution "The forgotten kids of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez:" a generation of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waiting and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to make a egg cooks, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and to learn to live so far.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody dead body of his father was shot dead by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence due to organised crime and fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city of the world due to the number of murder in public security and government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this represents an average of 8,5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live in view of the new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico is launched in 2015, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers who tortured the country in the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment in which it's about to raise a rumor or unmask a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years having dipped the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to pass further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident 7 years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to consider tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our longing to pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tanker passed the place Sange at the east of the DR Congo, kippte around and exploded. 230 people came into life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous parades full of strolls that were difficult to drive.</seg>

<seg id="829">Houses revered and stolen corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the immorality.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident make the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stolen body that upsets up on the ground during which they are looking at.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't find her end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken out for several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not to be attributed to tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the entsuperior Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically from atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bars.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed. "no one has remained back to count corpses," said a population to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many have been cut, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only using satellite images, the follow-up period could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unclarified, but the army point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram trial (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as a evidence for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misused use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of patches with patches; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was carried out as a cover for measures.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments such as this example falsely falsely falsely the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a declaration, by the United Nations, those who were able to flee rakes, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported by violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidic Arab news page, which was falsely told, the president Myanmars Than Being said, monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to record this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last updated on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, which called AFP as their source, had also falsely attributed to Tha Being this statement, but did not have taken the picture from the DR Congo in connection.</seg>

<seg id="860">Vestiges of this wrong coupling cuts until the year 2011 and 2012, and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse image search," you can see how far information borders can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A controversial picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images (as of 3 May 2017) 344 images, which are very similar to the mentioned image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mask of private pages, platforms social media and community and national publications, and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="904">The Myanmar government published an explanation of what she was as "intentionally presented news and photos, international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misconceptions concerning Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities took these events, which were suspected in the name of Islam, having found a larger attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was drilled as proof for the Boko Haram massacre of 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in relation to Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (irradiation) who passes these Posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to bigger discussions about the silence in the context of Christians through Muslims, Muslims - the murdered victims of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion Understanding and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can't give these images any longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are many people who unintentionally put the share of drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and misery that actual atrocities are untrue and smashing it the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that it is receding from pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images will even demand even from the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, concern that violent images readers and viewers can take advantage of empathy to empathy the empathy (such as this study to help others to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss non-violent representations in the news media, fact, fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". they are thoroughly suggested in which a picture suggests that which is actually loosened from the context or completely misused manner.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. unmistakable) strives to offer speech enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish brakes).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resists stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient, why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists include Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog one finds words from the VAT of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - BemÃ¼h for your parents in recognition of how to have been striving for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language that are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"truck adi" - The convenience, or sloth, you feel after a cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Burma's own words about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They detects other cultures, reveal other thought-ups and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site even more of this "unmistakable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1001">My friend looks at me and says, "these things do not affect you, isn't?" "why, because I am not a Muslim?" I wonder.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already run this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People living with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has built up in their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They suspects me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all right away.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion different.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, on different kind of art. but somehow we put all in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims, which will not fit there, are muslified.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Entmuslimised will become</seg>
<seg id="1011">I do not say that alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">That's even the poet that poetry is best selling in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love? love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the centre of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But religion was extinguished in the western idea, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists of Muslims's reduced images of Muslims, Western books have been colonised for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">These enticing image language is determined by the dark man that should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">In the 1970s, American scientist Edward Said laid out history behind these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these images continue to stand still today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have been working for three years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful, faulty narrative our newsfeeds dominate.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries in the last three decades, while the US won't even select their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narrative fail to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented, their headscarf will bear in public buildings and Saudi Arabian, Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same medal.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group practised his "control" to the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong Narrativ weakens Muslim women who lead movements to change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in the American soil of Afrikaners, which were brought about hither with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has relied deeply and flawed our collective predisposition, that often sikh men and children become an end-to-end attacks and jackets.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell, and because of the kind in which we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just talk stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create Narratives, who help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to fail to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree "diverse" religious group in America.</seg>

<seg id="1049">I am scherze, we do not wear all Taschenkorane with us.</seg>
<seg id="1050">We also have to be no theological experts to be "Muslim" or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all need to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the weapons of "others" in the public performance, for four decades myself scientist of Stanford was.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions following the role of him, consciously and unconsciously, as my friend and me in the rain during the Women's March, because the employment that we don't have a new future, while he had already broken down countries and "to others" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts here with all of us.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to enter here and in spite of a language barrier with someone else?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the stories of stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about an international initiative by Steven Bird, the unmistakable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language variety of great cities and appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin exists in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS already has conducted events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not available to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we accept cities, accept diversity - safe areas where residents do not have to forget who they are to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often is associated to understand" these events take instead of "listening to appreciate, to feel, to slip."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller points their story in their own language and translate or explain it to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and its representation will ensure that the listeners are on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughing and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou conate the opportunity to explain to their land typical customs of narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak from the bunnies and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having explained the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grinsen he shares his sense of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all that are inspired by the project can be arranged with TLS in order to organize their own history count.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re-establish sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debts of Puerto Rico, which took care of 72 million US dollars on the last 3 April 2017, took part in the country's puertorial Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Civil Front for the Neurorisation of the debt) and the Ãkomenian Church Meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The intercession of the reconstitution of debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ricos claims that the politicians, bÃ¤nkers and government agencies, responsible for the debt responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial test and a tap committee without personal interests in public debts, with a permanent, our working conditions of the compensation, which is responsible for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressurized and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refuses to pay a debt that is not their.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be finalized with sinking retirement payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not integrated into the territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on the socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state control.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide rerestructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed on the outside measures will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens, to be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missed throughout a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he provided for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that will be aligned to Berlin, dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of France-resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inner (The Cost of Freedom: a collective neighbour research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is licensed here, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to erect, like movements for free knowledge, and what the true costs are connected to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective remembered gives his friends and his family a voice to push his release, and they want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us may begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of timely extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was removed from the Adra prison, a non-military institution transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer of Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "of the military court of his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by individuals on November 12, 2015 and presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad government and they were aware of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in creating access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassel's cultural prototypes was more than the work that he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and the melting of Greek-Roman architectural types with hitherly traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, bass couldn't know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything in it, this architecture that embodies only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This move into the digital archeology and conservation has created a timsel, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was unable to shut up this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life so that I dream of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call upon his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge of everyone who has asked. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught others, as they use computers, at least in theory, without that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a prostitch which she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have been working together in the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuged the lyrics when she visited him, and he translated them from the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here's an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens in every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I hide in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the inbreeding in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers doesn't matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and guards</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I go into every detail of your voice and words,</seg>
<seg id="1235">I agree with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say void</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my solitude,</seg>
<seg id="1239">To get back all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And over your absence to weep and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you're still in the cage's cage.</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bass's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) have disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand in the hope we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption convicted director after detention release again</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique was reacted with anger on a corruption in which a government member rereturned to the workplace in the state apparatus, at which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is the case of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants, sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds in the airports of Mozambique, the council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good guide and immediately requested his return to the company, which happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which requested the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to refer back to his old posts, as the company did not fulfil any disciplinarisation process after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not doing the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short of CIP), an official institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clearly illustrate the absence of transparency and is even a setback in terms of the efforts of our legal system, so CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we need to know is that the company would have to lead to a disciplinaract method against the disputes.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The firm was silent, however, and caused no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambiian social media, rejects this behavior as well and considered the case as "contradictory":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be advisors when he was sentenced to a prison sentence and has served half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has grown to become reintegrated into the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Vibe, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil, says the director of no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he did not believe him that one was rewarded for someone who has already insulted the state in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza missing the morality to return and to serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead of serving herself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handheld it to an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was invited and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambique will not only remain in memory for ever as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, one-cut and - by the other, prophetic redundant.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he was energically confirmed that "an ambitious human being able to be able to sell his own concern for his ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know whether a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes tactics, but he doesn't turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today, the company relies upon him with which he promised to forgive them again under the contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - (Î±- _ Rafik), 12th May 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo of the magazine @ Verdade (to German:: truth) states that crime in Mozambique is paying off:</seg>
<seg id="1285">In fact, in # Mozambique thief and servant of the # Frelimo pays off. # Diodino Cambaza, for long term imprisonment, returns to # Airports of Mozambique - Emildo Sambo (@ EmildoSambo) 11 May 2017</seg>
<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocked the rassistic word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The bursous word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or coage.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network adopted its posts from the network because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally as adjectively "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook gives the word "Kalar" or to be selected in the social network as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of Hasselt in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, Ascension has given radical nationalistic movements to the word an extremely abrupt connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as an Hasselt against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat Hasselt in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may usually be associated with racism, but the word is calling on automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in the use of his used, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Beyond, there are several bursous words with basic meanings that have the same booktable like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese also wrote 'Kalar' taing ', which contains the same letter as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage'), 'Kalar Oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookups Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the Word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on spiritual way whether she could wander as he could lieve his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phru la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Halls is the opinion that she has to reduce their language radically nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic before it rejects all the posts that spread racism in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It fils the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What to do instead, is carefully analyze and control it by checking the opposite words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age nozzles).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, the Hasselt of Hasselt, received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to complain its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action will send a strong signal to all that hate-language, the efficiency of this strategy does not like long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have demonstrated that the censorship of percussions often become a catastrophic and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to extinguish his posts, when he only wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was listening to this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and told me the liken, posts and parts of contents for 24 hours, because the Post "The Facebook Community Standards didn't escape."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions, or they simply try to demonstrate their views against the hate radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate language:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author gave his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are badly in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more about the start of the initiative, for example the bursische Internet community by Council:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention of reducing racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words, only more hatred will be put within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words like "chair" or "heigcurry" have been forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even as they found out that they did not have mistakes, they were unable to report the falsibly deleted Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they have a large turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship is suckled by users for a lot.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users can now write about Facebook fun and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasselt to see if your posts will be taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and let pea curry eat and watch a Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word of Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1334">Post office says "If you are a doctor, do you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate language should also heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been nominated for his failure to talk to his Burmese pages under control, criticised.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of just reading the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context than in code concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's Parliament unanimously decided to offer a law that is to offer this practice so that the unmarried age is 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the husband of marriage and Muslim religious communities participated in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj was gathered to a group of representatives of the various religious groups in the country, that the state didn't interfere with the state that the state does not impose the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN children's justification, defined minors for everyone, under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 had already been married in Trinidad and Tobago in 2.8 percent, and 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 boys.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, who strives to bring laws to the childs, followed at the foot and rejoining great support. no doubt they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu FÃ¼hrer, for instance, had no concerns to tell the critics of the children's before, they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind religious opposition sorrowed for tensions in this actually incomplicated matter, and at some point, doubts, whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of opposition and an independent that contained themselves - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree, and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which read Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill against Child was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he had decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws have been last modified.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who held a ministerial Meeting in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary odede used to suffer the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was in mind that it was definitely enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was very happy that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status-update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, "Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spinning network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married age in Trinidad and Tobago is now, independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the change of marriage was today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives, there are 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were opposed to the law have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's toe is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childmarriageisaw.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have been foiled him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A Thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook depends on the shape of satellite Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, should the law be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General, Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said that Maharaj would like to go against the law, most social media users would be subject to the subject matter differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell struck:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of talking about the discussion as general, in a way that we may feel free to talk about the problem, that the state that our daughters may protect against them that they may be abused in advantage, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial approach against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still more places in the world where the praises in different gradations or continue the standard, although there are laws which they reject.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By reflection of websites, Turkish users can check Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, according to SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright legislation in the United States, internationally evaporated.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than a month Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and fans of TV series are fighting against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques have been used to use repositional websites (a recent article from the New York Times noted that Turkey has not reported the third largest VPN prevalescence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users are not in this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed since 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place of regular blocking of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world when it comes to Wikipedia the massive censorship by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked, several mirrors pages (pages which are mirrored the contents of Wikipedia and frequently are updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform based all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. computer calculator), which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is availabe in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post published IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the messages (via the lock of Wikipedia), we used everything to transfer snapshots of Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so the possibility of reading the content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't reach the website www.wikipe.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it's only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansicyclope.org, a Mirror side of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to hod similar Mirror pages if the country is closed by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices and employee at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One gets to another URL, which is not the original. that which one sees then is Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server guides the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A detailing rhino, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with bad-positioned motifs and fully-washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him a camera to wear and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepas, strives to bring to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home location next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that lenther the attention to Nepas wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook as the first-class situation in his work helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could give it better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just returned home, when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River was a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes there.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was, and I immediately began to knead images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar pursues a collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so furious as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know, because he had already stood tiger's face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger may not interfere with the opinion of sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also, because of the darkness he was in the way home, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he puts down immediately, and see me by the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicks on the environment) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to make the Bardia National Park photos of Ottern. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger photo and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again released as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, there are women with the greatest care, the names of their husbands or even by older males in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband due to the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should be mised to preserve this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted from the Indian state of Oska by a pseudostem in the Indian state and abdicated by their family and the village community after having addressed a secret relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also not to call upon behalf, is also common in men. however, they have far less laws to fear, if ever, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel, and housewives, a unique club and therefore became the main talks of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they discuss the delicacy of the patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and relies on the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pai has been working with the help of her video camera to the discovery of practices, such as children's heirs to the prohibitions of HIV- and AIDS infected, and manages this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs were created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made them at the bottom of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion round, acted by women who do not call her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided for this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To speak the name of their husbands, a bridge is also not guilty to all obligations and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition bears witness that a woman respects her husband and wishes to wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this, is regarded as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have taken care of this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Rohini wanted to start at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband, has never been trying to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him at his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands in Maharashtra on the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that during the whole practice it was pushed forward, and another decided to allow all frustration against him and out his family, causing him to curse him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Nor in the Adrenalinexchange, with an ancient fires broke, the women decided that they would actually try to call her husband to name her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a wide variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put on women in the head, and his wife could not stop to tell his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law came up, she was afraid, and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation existed in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as Tragen of the zinnoberred Punching on the forehead, which shows the state status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the inquÃ© red dot if he had to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I heard him to bear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women do not have stopped doing so, but they mean, they are now in a better position to choose him not to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a secure place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip with every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang, and talking about things about which they had never been thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on this problem for so many years and yet, I have also talked about some things, for example, such as our identities to our husbands, never said so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things to say loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we have maintained about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, the okay, but some wanted to bear a Salim-Kurta, a large shirt about a trousers; they don't have weeds.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own hangers, the morals connected with saris and much more, lubricate Rohini (upper hemden) in a discussion round, so that women were able to bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan an excursion to Goa while they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months have been changed since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are slowly going into the reels:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped to tell the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women bear now at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion club know that the changes that they want to reach their lives in their lives - like the Feiling around greater freedom of movement or the own dress code - at the end of a difficult navigable river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving themselves each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club, each of us, is confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home to home and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to leave the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here is quite quickly clear that they had no other choice than to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of cult band is "more than just a universal language such as English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail price, Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>

<seg id="1559">Today the Beatles-memorial day is.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know whether this "Winnie the Pooh" doll John Lennon is to represent or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, you are the 5 places you don't have to visit.</seg>

<seg id="1571">Today the Beatles-memorial day is.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! made up a pilgrimage to London and ran through the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies can also use the fan base as well as for example, such as the Ramen Shop (Ramen Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping people for the organ trade, probably for superstitious purposes, presumably the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in Milking, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were taken from.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently found them that the organs of Shaman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a glorious man of gold abstain or wealth, the police Officer of ZambÃ©zia, declared the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks were registered on glorious men in Mozambique.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incarcerated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has announced attention in the international community, after his lawyer had announced in late June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (stateching) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has been referred to as "an internal matter" and a speaker described it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to have views from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, permit or release a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of Paares in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Poind Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu in foreign countries abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brend have refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into the Stocks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government had announced that this ultimately won't have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations have been continued until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to regain the nitaries to China, since the exports had been mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditionally release and invited Liu to get his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to increase his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to free to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomatic relations of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called for China to release the release of Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all limitations of Mr Lius's wife, as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all the visits, they wish, and able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans want him to have the opportunity for the treatment of foreign affairs, insofar it is for help to help him. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">An spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP announced on June 27 that the embassy was invited to release the Chinese authorities not just Liu, but also his wife Ms. Liu Xia of their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US embassy relieve a desert response from China following himself, with the exterior of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country has the right to intervene and irresponsible comments about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel data and access to medical care of its choice, which, according to Chinese constitution and legal system, and international obligations are entitled.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push out Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I challenge China to release the Nobel Prize Laureate # LiuXiaobo to give yourself into a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, the German government speaker Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu "gets all the medical support he needs" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the 7th and 8th July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing's news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vortex might be overshadow Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, John McCallum's Canadian Ambassador asked China to provide an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to provide himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP that Lius's wife, Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk with someone outside, including his lawyers, contact us and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to uphold his international human rights issues, including freedom of expression, to uphold and liberate the rights of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments that he needs, irrespective of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have a contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news featured France Info has already reported that the French government would have welcomed Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information about whether France will ultimately absorb him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the festivities in Taiwan called on June 27 to allow Liu liberate and to show a bigger tolerance towards those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">In China, the Taiwanese legislature urged China to allow China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in a statement on 28 June around Liu very concerned and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that he took the initiatives that he accepted and had been strictly punished with a harmonious, stabilise, and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed for democracy, freedom and legal rule in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem dumb, since Singapore is recognized as independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on a meeting of the international branch of the state of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, where most people get a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are no country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accuses the Justice Minister, "to twist logic," to defend the existing authorization of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and offerings, this valuable country is to create, you can say that we are no country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had a escape before the responsibilities, a mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons of Shanemugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of its, seemed unweird undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">By contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities that are permanent from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the Thas's core point, the good old suffering from the Authoraries of Machines, which prehenceforth democratically, abandoned logic, since it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">During the final week of Shanmugam he gave answers to his American guests concerning our Press, our Judikative, our political system truly non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions cloaked with non-answers rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to illustrate his mind, as they didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our advertiser K Shanmugam would take this point to clarify this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the town of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">In order to publish his comment on the blog, he points out concerning the critics that you should begin to understand the entire participation of the conference, so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam would understand better, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" be a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so infinitely important to us, even if we are free and free elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He understood Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was no country, "he obviously not meant it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, who makes the leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Justice Minister of Justice has said to have...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that expects me to agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated with what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review destroys the weaknesses of Shanemugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shanmugam have committed a mistake, or was it a dream speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on what country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Governors' government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam is of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do they provoke their military service to their military service, but do not defend their own country only?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The journal Journey of a Decade for the time of the year, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have neglected many people...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country above all" etc., but that's not quite right.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his editors: what is the most misleading aspect of your residence or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world and another facet should be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked in Japan is: "are you an American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry," I come from Canada. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on which situation is taking place, it is regarded as polite, interest in his conversation with personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Then, on my clarification, the default response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians do not cook in front of anger if they are kept for Americans, but don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there are little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian banner well to their backpack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">However, Americans are....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was even when I started to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free healthcare!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We say obviously very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposedly considered the most tolerant land compared to ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as such types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends that I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It would not make me anything if you would go to Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly, as a "nice" means to be spat, meaning to be spat - such as the benign, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure of Ned Flanders, "The Simpsons" (which has a Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which one can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Be harmless, means unobtrusive and uninteresting to earn and no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far off the things that pass around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as going to say that the desire is to be free and only to be one of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to worry about our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What's back as "nice," is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk about the fence with the neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm hearty, open kindness, which I have to connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than "nice." our prime minister has made Canada just sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop-band parodized Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous pop-band has released a musical video that took power to the junta, which took power in 2014, and despite their promises to restore the civilian government, the country continues.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him which rules his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers directly to the ongoing military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days the video was uploaded on Facebook and received 1.254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">You can interpret the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics, especially in the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Watch out at once these images of the video, which relate to some of the political topics that have pursued Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" possibly refer to the draconical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which gave the commander-in-chief of the host of absolute national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious programme for "unity change" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons who are considered to be a critic by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law about computer criminality, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to suspicize activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, monitoring online content and persons who were accused of having assassinated the monarchy, criminal prosecutes.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand establishes a stricken accusation against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was established in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to purchase is their choice of expensive U-boats, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax veins.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shows how people get thrown into a black delivery vans before they bring them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in prison, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and threatened by internet use, they should be insulted the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the Teaser of the songs of the band, which was imitated the salut of the "The Tribute of Panem," who had already been used by putsch during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only recovered very slowly in East-Asia-Asia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now been over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchasian War was officially ended, but its scars are still visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern districts in Tkuarchal show distinctive pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and KharChilava are located in the carbon basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, depreciation, Georgiers and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet times.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and Abchases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called violin cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are just a few hundred people in these vulva cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16.000 people had barely increased after a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017 and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a corp-pink spectacle frame and golden-coloured earrings in the TeddybÃ¤ren.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather she himself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are in transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds African and haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells the people coming to full busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They would not refuse to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them, and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balsam eased away from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa is a reasonable first name for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a joghurstache) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil, hoping to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have lived in Brazil, however, it is for some Africans, that are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other waymen of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and the Africans often travel together the tour and that Africans already speak on WhatsApp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his signposts, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM card to save the necessary money to buy the Bunitet to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," he answers smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests she often send text messages when they have gone to gren her, or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chickens to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family included migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Bustuets will be sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking site.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the wilderness, and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, after a raid on his work site, he was expelled from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to get money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for a accommodation and an unknown, a Allende who offered it to her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears you consult the travellers quiet their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full but it is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother floats her in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hairy that you made a rally, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs at me while she is nearing her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya is fueron", repeating it every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang of Twitter users to be able to resolve them.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile user in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it shows the District government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the message, the app is said that "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities refused to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they were shortly after they had installed the app, news with a private cloud group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police report that the app will determine the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornographic web pages, by online scam, Trousers and Phishing pages to make users attentive, how much time they spend online and to remote control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors shall help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these features can of course be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" remote actors or even hackers able to manipulate or steal home network using a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures relating to control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the east and south, the reality is very often nosterer for those who live in distant, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit the unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinempowering Internet shutdowns.</seg>

<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile message demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices which are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through uncoated technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" ("" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the proliferation of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office in operation of their computer and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a US-American Human Rights Organization, also mentioned this new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs, up to 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable disks, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and annihilate any "terrorist videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1997">One that makes all honor to their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has been defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that allow no metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But when the scenes looks back and you looked behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubt, in smoke, and you will be aware of your existence, even if the earth is on the axis of the monster. you will clear that you are here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, have built stone for stone.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They have arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to formulate "my lesson," as the leader of security intelligence formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure.</seg>

<seg id="2003">Five teens were torn during a peaceful protests like weeds from the beautiful garden of our Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to break the city's darkness at night with "Allahu Akbar" screened.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the quarters were coveted, only my own not.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time it was quiet, rainy, at the wrong time, even if I had no high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accompliments.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night the things had calms down after the power supply had stopped in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke down the silence by calling several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house rooftop.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice through the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later, some of my friends were courageous enough to find together.</seg>

<seg id="2013">In such a moment you will be aware that you have delivered the spirit out of the lamp, but it's just interested in barley.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "make you ready, we meet at the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can return to your voice, after you have sent them all the way up to the office of the security services.</seg>

<seg id="2025">I was so certain that I answered, "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I've never stopped to look at your eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I regret no word from what I said.</seg>

<seg id="2035">I prepared all the details exactly before I entered the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise, they probably have allocated a greater cell for me this time.</seg>

<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell-fin was a "Ersthrowling."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long tick he replied to me.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a prestigious man-old age which looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness, there are no prominent facial features, and doctors do not exist here; we are all only numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone whose voice is similar to me?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers provide its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was relocated in one of the great cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had assured to me, they would be happy when I stay.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would like to have had a scarecrow to drive all these crows, which lends itself to the fruit in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From the distance, I still hear "Allahu Akbar."</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time the cry every day.</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure you with him and you can't keep your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, so that the pipe was cast out through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first capture, I asked myself whether the investigator had been working as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other, to present ourselves from their point of view, great invention of a giant cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour, three of them rarely changed, while I was still on the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost every sense in my body - and my voice, why I listened to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noted the cooling down and did not find favor in it, why he is next to a electrically charged staff.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body, stretched out on the floor was the perfect electric conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must probably have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that it was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed away, which came to me as a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschfuker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth: "my lord, my father must make terrible troubles."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they were always released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do you lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib raucht a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib neglect the majority of his time in his own time, and he concludes on his screen, even at his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">On what you can leave, a cigarette between his fingers and his nicotine lips can be discovered.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the Supreme Court of his family house which has been part of them since 1967; the year in which Israel lost its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Hdaib has been a passionate activist for six years now, the conservative majority vote against gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapesmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often argued with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also calls on the core of the entire Arab world. all of these themes will not only be found in his home town of Relevance, but also in cities that extend from Damascus to Syria by far to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At his age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders, and he can feel free according to their own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it doesn't exist openly, he turns against the US foreign policy a special enumeration.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib viewed his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those who want to survive in war regions, anything with his identity as "Palestinian poultry" of the second generation, "so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and never existed in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own living circumstances," Hdaib stresses.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while in water dissolved nest cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; it is planned for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking up with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senseless hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the sleepers speak tepid coffee and the scarves of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan like a prison under free sky, especially if you have a view into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water to drink - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordanian has canceled a show of the band Mashrou'Leila already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary majority support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontskers Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table is.</seg>
<seg id="2112">S & D vice-president of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled due to sexual orientation of the Sangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim that the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab spring, human rights and free opinion of opinion in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that asks the ancient legitimacy authoritarian regimes in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be easy to be a rhetoric, but actually a clear-crystalline reality in Jordan reflect that in Hdaibs plant clearly appears.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib resisted traditional lineage in the body by making his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have voyhelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an evidensely unknown woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of 'honorary murder' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honor of Honour in 2016 reached its peak; however, an institutional infrastructure is missing in order to support women who, victims, attempted murder, or domestic violence, to be appropriate to the appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for fragile control from the year 1954, women who are subjected to a danger of inadequate violence, "and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures, as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, even not to reverence on issues surrounding in his country as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, a fact that he may take his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and opinion, cannot be separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was deceived policy, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically within the core can continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse is repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the songs, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which you can get what you want, "whether faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there are hardly anyone in Jordan concerning the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality between LGBTQ + individuals remained strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogramme Roya in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a worked version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuevo, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained in remembrance thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Semitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government appealed attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive votes become silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service offered several former government and members of the teaching staff, with the grounds that they had expressed in social media critical to the problems which were related to the deep in the country with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert of Hdaibs is according to the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work as structural changes in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress has been a constant belt and take-off. Jordan has managed a show for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it looks down blue, thought and spiritualised changes. it is sure that this changes took place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreamed, such as millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dreams of bringing his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to see them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be inspired by music, art and literature of a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, battle unitions and artificial democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until far as far as it is, Hdaib is raging and resisted resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which is part of a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the trucks, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have survived, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force Emishi in his knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, therefore we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can imagine difficult to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two sects are straight to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only truth - and to spend their summer in this way:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and I watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-meter-high fortress was unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history, because they are helping to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug dealers are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region can not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance, and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to always give more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can rebuild these applied hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the outer limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts from each other to show, who can create the eccentest looms as you can see in the following video (other videos about current competes are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to change young people on their weapons against hair tools and instead of bad advice to create an apprenticeship in the hairstyle of hairstyle which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the end of March, and reported about some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district, whereof we are very proud because of love to the children we have built this education community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the "love message" in guerrilla fighters, "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel out to bring affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question was the two young Columbian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the head and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people signed with guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the FARC's guerrilla movement, which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was applied to the signatory of peace agreement than so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of columnemakers, there is still a long way until one can talk about a real reconciliation, and from peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived for many years in illegal camps have been exposed to a war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons were carried away, they must be reintegrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, had used to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred against guerrilla fighters, these are now able to support them in their ranks and support them in the building of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnians had to join together with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters, which should then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk just with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who we love to write on Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more constrained.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he continued to tell us this year his love with people who needed the most urgent addition.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was designed to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and create a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the context of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that somebody would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camp in Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to survive the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC stood up, as they had done before, to make the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they were not given orders, but letters full of subsating of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political knowledge of Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After handed over the letters, a former fighter led me through the camps of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I entered into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla struggles live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because in the bed there was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the DornrÃ¶schlaf.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I asked him, 'Hello, what do they say? "he answered," I answer a letter which someone has written to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, somebody has written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him, and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry for all those years of faithful companions of this fighting, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else expected of life than war. the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of starvation. "I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned just how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the outset, students and leader of the FARC came together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up as already war and the FARC had already seen in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we have experienced how the social injustice had worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people still had to hear, who had never found hearing, and to recognize that the people I have seen often as a monster, and even hate only people with beautiful feelings that were turned by their life and their environment was painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The truth in which the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed, and have done so much harm to give us something, and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the example of DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Kolumba was prophesying that peace would reign after the disarmament of peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will be always people who are willing to attack weapons and protest to their rights, and that's totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">From the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">This is why we invoke all the defenders of peace - no matter what breed, religion or ideology, they belong to all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from my own experience that nothing is easy. to those who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2242">It follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Aida Mirmaksumowa and published its first publication on the OC Media website.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region, are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and stress.</seg>
<seg id="2244">In terror, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, which depends on the people's LGBTQ community, is not first emerged about the night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines before several months after reports published, which have been published the towing, torture and murder of queens in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who took suspicious queer men and woke them into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she was raised, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens experienced by the gender equality of their land, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She was afraid of fear for her life in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helpers for a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day was told me that somebody needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transluous woman lying in difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone who thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. "then there is no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the round on WhatsApp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned myself, I felt somewhat in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you honour the family, you love?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awake at the hospital at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had to get everything and started scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurse were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I got a threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called to me, wrote to me - relatives, foreigners, some entirely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightfall.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded me to return to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove to prove it up without the streets; others, that I had not changed in the official TV in Grozny, and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what could I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tried to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother in the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she got a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with darkened window slices and a number plate with a number of 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, I was clear that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights-Friends reviewed the Numbers - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I will not give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without order to register, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw her in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe that you were in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you tick. you even know your pimmerness.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was indeed my pimmerness.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality, however, this is a theme theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements, I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish it, this wild barrier can't overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really give it trouble to look like the person who remembers them from their past, so remember my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But it is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the present situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who has one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that while Ramadan was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this, I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood genugation.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men now even gay men in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says that there wasn't very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relatives, or who were left from their relatives to face Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present themselves later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand you?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people not simply disappeared, but targeted, to radicalise itself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I quote someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken it.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was involved, when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports until now. we suggest that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not allow this man to shave yourself?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who include a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to lead us to the "Civilization," but finally thrown back into the stone time.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted, I had coloured eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Ministry of Sharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, mainly on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole town knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrasing: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says to children when they are doing about crane.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply shut up their eyes before you, because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have insulted me, never hunted, and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this gifts time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He didn't talk about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had lived and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic is steadily slowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities do you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I earn not much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still worked as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I agree with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetreffs, merging, I have committed them to hospital and help them to get eating tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, as I clicked a curse.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alerly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That's exactly the same as Chechens who wish you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no gay in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have what Cabardiner have, which Russians also have, on all planets there is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslim who go to the mosque and, during Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of transidentity of men who love men, and they believe that you are changing his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a trusteer.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different habitsettings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I'm now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Awazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the past few months, there is a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi came back on 27 August the desperate situation of the Arab ancestor community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra near Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered during anxiety, depression, and he emitted for his own helplessness, the inability to come up for his family, so Ahmad human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">On YouTube, a video grabbing the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people manage it quickly to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, they were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only one of suicide in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists in front warn that there would still be more men that could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahmad Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing common: they were all family members, who felt like persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to feed their families and to work on a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, based on a large part of the Arab Awazi community living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and made major efforts to finish the ethnic autonomy in the whole Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Awaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in the past oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most valuable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illness, hunger and kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refuses the Ahwazi Arab citizens systematically in the local area of oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of twimen, the water of the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroy the devastation in the region by drought, and to destroy local agriculture and fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab AHawaiian youth now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director for Collaborative, Work and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahraazis, who seek a job, finished elementary school, 55% completed a secondary school and have a university degree of 45%.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahmad men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become even worse. the reason for this, a combination of a high number of Ahwaz are new to ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions are prefers to adjust Arab labour force, the local Arab Awazi will escape access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihood outside of their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surnames to hide their affiliation to the ancestor, as even Arab names are not tolerated in the workplace, because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that have to bear Arab ancestor, human rights activists strike the alarm before the situation explosives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, whether the world is awake and taking knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why don't I unidentified myself with feminism, even with the intersection not"</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women speak, especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frust.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay a well thought of scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be a feminist * within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under stringent observation, if it is about doing what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure there are women sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and familiar.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come on skin color, racism, black Cis women, on black women from Diaspora; when I chose to mention that kind of feminist, seelically and verbal, many white feminists settled in silence and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - come together to raise "their voices, and 'Kumbaya" to sing, "to sing the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, an institutional form of racist motivated violence, which we are subjected to black women to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin spend less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all the women, all males and all men who have neither skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to consider the unrighteousness in their thinking, which relate both to gender and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I'm not going to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that always has rejected me and countless other black women forever.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which can also absorb our customs and customs to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not attempt to get white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women a home and to settle down from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to join me full and completely from feminism and to join me from feminism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubbornly, that interferality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we define black women looking for our own ideas and give us into the spheres, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana uranism: how we will defend ourselves, in which we can defend ourselves on our own way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be denied.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatist and marginalization as they have read these lines, please tell you about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because I have existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised as a part of this paradigmas due to my dark skin and because of my life as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life had neither escaped, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2468">As part of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published here again.</seg>
<seg id="2469">We traveled to Nabil Musa in the past 7 years - usually with surf board or in canoe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. its mission aims to make people aware of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to its church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," tells Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which uses to protect the rivers, streams and water flows in Iraq, as well as local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video Musa summarizes the pressures and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multi-media journalist, produced, filmed and published.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The focus of her work is based on a little remarkable subcultures and is characterised by using cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with their help to tell municipalities that can tell their stories their way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of turally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefraubin) who reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their own partner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time was passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena was demonstrated because of abuse, there is also no use of Ada BÃ¡ez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman moved back their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the devil, violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women do not refund at all, they are generally not receiving support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases the women are also financially dependent on men who abuse it. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to have victims of violence, at all at the prosecution authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Indurable 1 strokes and Statistical Bulletin 2 Invisible Misuses and a legal system that does not work any underlying 3 of the laws: good approach, defective recoverings and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women really misuses, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher of Genderasks, Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers below are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District Court of Attorney, there were 9600 readings for domestic violence. 70% of them fell by violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peacekeeping. 86% of the ads came out here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics show not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these offences are actually displayed in fact. "on any woman who refunded in Paraguay because of mental abuse, 9 women will not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">In any woman, which are refunded due to physical abuse, two women, which do not do this, "stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a perpetual offence, the prosecution authorities cannot be documented appropriate, as many women are murdered each year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">In Paraguay, co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay was documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman died due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then. this should always be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she bore psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time, recognizing the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would be victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read earlier this, I thought that only women happen to refrain because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuses of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote articles on Facebook, in which they described his accusations and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen so long from Carlos and didn't left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, was fighting almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to strike them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias Advertisements in the authorities stopped without earnings and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partner who developed into an unmistakable legal fight between Paraguay and their home country, in which it was mainly for money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great issues in use of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, the draft law was discussed under the hashtag # Porellas (# FÃ¼rstenance).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonEasy Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law looks ahead, Femizid to explain to an independent offense, and harder to punish as it is in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the legislature has changed in some points, in order to win the MPs for the law, feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions which currently being banned in Paraguay are generally forbidden to be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The bill of bill provided that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost, which need to carry out the victims of violence at present themselves, if they simply want to receive, and maintain a safe accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri, argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature has no sufficient financial resources available:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay failures are seen as part in human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, there must be a rethinking that violence is no longer considered a little Nordic.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep silent in view of this facts are guilty, and contributes to that the perpetrators are gone away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to refund so long, until failures do not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed. among other things, parts of the law was cancelled, which the partners were knitted in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggressor, to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website was closed due to a decision of the information Minister," on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the omanic authorities closed the independent Arabic newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he served one year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari, and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before the court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after his father, Said ibn Taimur, which led by a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then he was clothed in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the principal offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans of Sultan is characterized by the beharming efforts of security forces, in particular the domestic secret service, the public relations, including press freedom, limit and human rights defender, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematic peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, also activists, making their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inception in 2007 (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, released a article entitled "High-ranking Parties to the title" High-ranking Parties. in this, it went to corruption in the Judist and the interference from high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS took the Deputy Editor-editor Yousef Al-Haj, who moved to Al-Maamaris arrest as chief editor.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed on uncertain time after the Information Minister had given the statement that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on every way, including online, will be forbidden on August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">The first negotiation in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place on 26 September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj both were convicted for the disorder of the public order, "abuse of the internet" and "excavation of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of injury of a ban and slander for crimes.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and penalties in the amount of 3000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a year-old professional ban was imposed against the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of money in the amount of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after making use of an information network for spreading material which could be a risk for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a deposit was set at the amount of 5000 omanic rial (13 000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgement of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court spoke Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>

<seg id="2576">The permanent closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman at the youngest time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include the closure of the independent journal Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to put into operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the closure of Azamn and the detention of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the omanic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the press freedom of press freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need on site medical research there are two reasons: in the offer of global healthcare industry, many medicines and vaccines that cover special medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread consequences in the poorest countries of Africa as elsewhere, and lack of investment for research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists itself, helps building its own research capacities in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Central Committee on the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic first showed a serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself asked the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and on misconceptions of the media on these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I supported the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Besides, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always keep recipients instead of being movers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who come back or go here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you haven't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have continuous supply with electricity, water and Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need of special scientific training, starting in any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (not transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals are accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how to change "open source" seed producers in global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine published about solvents for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 types, such as outredders, the first plant grown by NASA's astronaut in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was placed only by his own objectioning and the question of how many salads he can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a specific rotor or green leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more of such patents have been registered, such as grain or cartographers. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food safety ensure the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton still maintains salad, however, however, it takes longer because his work is still worth more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is when in a river a rock are lying around which I must paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand before the court, no one can breed more a new salatry, because all features are already patented. "he makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful, however, to use no material which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is always larger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have bred red sketch of the variety of outredders in the "greenhouse gas station" and eaten. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like that, when the movement from the IT area should come and do not come from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">She was called to life in order to ensure that some plant species and are not being protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders is permanently usable.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders is committed to undertake that others can be able to use seed freely from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to sell business and sell it. "open source" breeder can only allow others to breed their seed, so that it is forbidden to avoid such a variety - two aspects that are forbidden through many plant patente.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seeds plays a role in larger relations like Biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter not or only little use by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified, or not, in order to buy our goal of environmental sustainability, the most recent examples of linings of chemicals and Syngenta and Bayer, as it is offered to farmers markets, should also know that the way is bred on farms, such as these vegetables is being farmed.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food confident people without seed-confident people is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide others their seed still free of charge. thus, their approach is to be patented in contrast, seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Supporters argued that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is always restricted by restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the German language director of Ossi, has worked with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all boxes features are protected as intellectual property, making it either possible for plant breeders, either not or is worth only.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are not such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants like wheat in still larger style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visiting</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated as farmed that they have targeted features - from such, through which their taste or their color improves until this, due to which they thrive in certain environments and keep threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing as much more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently more constrained than ever before, since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also important for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture Ministry of the United States set up the company for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">She contradicts that intellectual property of other breeders, since "patents and protection of plant variations innovations." "a patent is basically taken a plan that anyone can follow once the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these statements help others to come with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection inhibits innovation not, but promotes them to be provided with the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent loop, certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you could have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources always have been a general good and could continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers easier for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what we drive, and it will be impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton does not interfere with the concept to patented plant features: "we do not really create the features itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who bred a variety, also breeding his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with great farms and monocultural tures, for which cultivation of herbicides need to be needed, breeding in his varieties of this concept in agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very imaginable. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While a few medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it will enable most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patented or they hold it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">Frank Morton's independent plant breeders is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders by the avoids of plant patented innovative would: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies who patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to constantly create new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years old, "he says." with a patent you're protected for 20 years ahead of competition, wherewith my opinion it just makes it easy. "worldwide Resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the United States seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept will now spread rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes themselves as professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open source" plant. to maintain the seed of traditional crops, the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports it, to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell her own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol works on an "open source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeders differ from land to land, absent due to the Ossi commitment not one to one in Europe or other parts of the world can be taken.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents to conventional farmed plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">There is no explanation, however, not a law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" -seed systems in Ethiopia, based on farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards preservation of seed crops.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for the Open Source "Program for" Open Source "-seed systems that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "plant-up systems for which the plan to fall next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental protection and development groups (among them Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and Concentration) has compiled a database to plant seed and biodiversity around the world around Seed Map Project, a seed map to publish a plant map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - it represents that farmers have to come to come to seed and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply may be ensured with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also emphasises the importance of a variety, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Luby of Ossi hopes that soon more people will see him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food is mainly grounded, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," so Luby. "we are trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook, in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The principal Network for Human Rights Information bleaching in spite of this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian right and the Constitution to defend this goal, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities were exhausted to overcome the blocking, and not to admit it. we hope to keep our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of webside bullets fell victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Next to ANHRI also exists on the blog of columnisten and Human Rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of Columbus and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he addressed to circumvent the Zensurate of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which Ziadas blog is home, on the other hand, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces when he reported about the student protests and recorded a video as the police exercise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article are mainly turning around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this signifies for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the lock is not important for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has managed to give me the feeling of a siege insurrection; an arrest, an attempted murder, unloading at the national Security Council, the lock blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an impact, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to handle censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after having locked it, and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mucus walk the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities blocked the technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE documented the blocking of providers, through the reversing of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we realized how to offer the locking of websites, which began VPNs.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block content and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will include, in addition, that the censurination decisions can be met behind worn doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction before the court may take action against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants must fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Daily newspaper reports from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of the country and home of numerous Postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old in school shot," "Every day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro were murdered," "Dithieves the pharmacy with military weapons," "" President Templates sends 8500 soldiers of the army, marine and air-air to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tended financial situation, the threshold of 2017 reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The United Nations's Brazilian non-governmental organisation even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So, for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16, the Editorial "This is not normal," in which she announced to establish a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision stated the paper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sexualverts, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard, and what is only in Rio, is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we don't close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, Chief Editor of the Newspaper that this decision was no occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war rubridk in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video there is a journalist in the newspaper that there are 843 territories according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial, the Newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, even if it is distorted, gramities of the police, which only shoot and then asks questions to disguise.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the name "War" do more than it use?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, the journalist of CecÃ­lia Oliveira, arguing that this was a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could be difficult to steer the responsibility of the police force.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - such as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, enlightenment and historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as a "non-violent place in Brazil," according to CecÃ­lia is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are within the north and north east of the country. these are the most recent available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No such cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we see the murders per state, Rio is on rank 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">An extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, emphasises such as CecÃ­lia, has repeatedly been repeating the State policy of the State since years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">For these security policy measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the police unit, used by the state of Rio in 2003, aimed at conquering the favela of a massive police offering and incorporate a unit to permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent death. for some years, the UPP was able to protect against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux was quoted from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio did not comply with the following criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the State, funds and ways, which are typical for a war. this is the intrusion of a "enemy" in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and the object for "collateral damages" and "distorted balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio continues to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now that the police captured the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho eromm to avenge the death of a police officers.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence also made headlines: a fruit hiker died due to shame which had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly strong, where an attack on chemical weapons resulted in the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practised by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these have stood by rebels controlled areas outside of Damascus, which led to the inhabitants that residents were drawn up or provided by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the longlasting blockade, traditional food stuffs like meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>

<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnear and lead the project together with the NGO al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the traditional, planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, her food-food makes them an attractive food source for many people of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally sourced materials are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began working with the "production of the regions of pilgrims" before they checked their quality, and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "apprentice court for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the start of the project and after 3 months, they have distributed fungi anywhere in East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protest on 21 October in many districts of capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two and forty people were killed and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October. this led the government last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region, where there were 4 dead in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that more than 500 fire outbreaks took place in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, PedrÃ³gÃ£o was resettled a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings, in Portugal alone approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon area.</seg>

<seg id="2848">In PedrÃ³gÃ£o's streets and villages have been evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would happen again as in June, since the streets were very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits are stored in estrities with a high fire of brandy.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far proposal on the forest form, which had brought the government to severe fires in the years 2003 and 2005, was assigned by the municipalities, who saw new rules as an obstacle for investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law, if the applicant had any means of funds for self-protection, that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," says JoÃ£o Sorval further from the same article of the newspaper PÃºblico.</seg>

<seg id="2873">During a night in the fall of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a terrible war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings, which had defeated short-lived pro-Soviet government. so Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say it at that time, she knew that she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">The boy was to break down in the morning of dawn.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and kill him.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara dominant party of the b-e-Wahdat was assassinated just by the Taliban and suddenly felt many Hazara suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban were getting closer to their hatred for the Hazara known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the country in direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself back in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a colegation for a few years. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went into Iran again. once again he was found in a strange country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," I remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we worked also.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no facilities there and no heating. we hanging nylon before the open window, so that we don't let it at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf in the homeless alone, walked through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day on meals.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for long-term asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers find asylum seekers in the country is disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special admission centres." this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission center, if they officially put an application for asylum - what can be submitted for months after the registration of the asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for a stay, either on the hospitality of friends, or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unwanted lifestyle helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had made various work in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf invaded the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so well that he opened a second hostel after a while, and opened a barbell.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of directors Amin Wahidi.</seg>
