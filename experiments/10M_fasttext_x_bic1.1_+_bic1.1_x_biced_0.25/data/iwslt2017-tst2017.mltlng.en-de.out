this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the NSA heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally existed for a nuclear bomb .
if it sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter wasn &apos;t right ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government determined against R@@ isen and called it to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol for the design of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and enter@@ tained journalists .
according to First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ tigen .
so when the government had kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many brave rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they were long for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government would fall down .
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , the Reporter and sources can always hide less .
rather than to fail and aw@@ nings on statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , is concerned about his phone number ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banks information , its lending service , and even travel services with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ cks .
unfortunately , it is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more convicted than all the US governments together .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much about their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government has always has more possibilities to explo@@ it all .
but just like the government &apos;s government to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
indeed , they can take this from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the night , in a witness stand .
today there are communication software that had not been written as circles his book , and it is essentially more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source development system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet &apos;s most famous , developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working .
rather than to send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , such as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot explain any more information , and many of the information that would like to request would be not available in advance .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are always developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that are all vulner@@ able to us .
it is important to ensure that not only technology ator , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to give Miss@@ ile data . it is just as important that we protect the next win@@ le@@ f@@ ice ,
who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers , and of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm hits the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes , but to protect our rights rights .
thanks .
&#91; 3 &#93; 3 April 2016 the largest dat@@ le@@ ck of history has been published . &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a Declaration . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a explanation . &#93; This week we were submitted by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will receive an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works .
this has already been very direct consequences too .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has been re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a con@@ voy of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad station@@ ing companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s business , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , who wait nervous upon the next publication , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to weep from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we go ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , and not all of their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few are used to hide and suffer - something we have been discussing and un@@ veil for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always put it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these prayer .
it can be very difficult for law en@@ forcement and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really what matters .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there was no prominent Americans so far , the sc@@ andal that sc@@ andal in this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a Dat@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we &apos;d see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states , less information must be found to create a company as a library card .
this species of the In@@ transparent in the USA has allowed employees to leave school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters , especially vulner@@ able investors .
it is this type of behavior , which concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a conce@@ aled investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister to bring the susp@@ ects money to the US to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked us that all up to a lawyer &apos;s lawyer made suggestions as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ meetings . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider these not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who built our hidden investig@@ ator suggestions .
it &apos;s not about a single leading pol@@ iti@@ ker , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may seem surprising , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing would have changed , as if there is always the weal@@ thy and powerful .
but as borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist , I definitely see that some things have started to change .
in the past few years , we have seen amb@@ itions to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the subject took place in political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU is recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA has hin@@ dered it .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used to provide funds in the US and global for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind head@@ lines .
we need managers in the economy that arise and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end through laws this type of in@@ transparent .
together , we can finally end the In@@ transparent which enables even this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I have been kidnapped once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a farm sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed there and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was in the city only and made a road trip throughout the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he was even worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
that &apos;s a small trunk !
then I heard me saying , &quot; I have an air @-@ bed . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Go , how please ? &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I was star@@ red on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I built here ?
a game of wild sleep in my living room .
what if it is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , to the door tips to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art , which he had bought from me , depends on his class@@ room today . he is a teacher .
it was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view angle .
perhaps the people who were sold out as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be waiting for ?
people on my air strike was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mat@@ rat@@ ze .
let us take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates , and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think , creativity can make it to transform fear in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment will be able to stay with a designer bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air@@ bed on the wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ on tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I arrived .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rental ?
things came to the re@@ els .
my former co @-@ resident , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
thus , we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website on the people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are passed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but did not do it .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allowed him to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned all the children that strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you can rely on things that can be well . we could design@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence in design , between people who had never met before .
can design do so something ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
I want to give you a cost sample , which degree trust we em@@ bal@@ m .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you from your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ lock mobile phone your left seat .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when she open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you &apos;ll see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked phone of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
the people feel the responsibility .
you can also feel the most guests , if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just once , who actually has Al Go@@ res Handy now ?
could you tell Twitter that he was dict@@ ating for the president of the president ?
you can return the cell phones now .
they have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you some of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had only presented with his name , if he tells how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine , you would have 150 denom@@ inations that say : &quot; he can really keep it very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a good @-@ through feedback system strengthens trust is crucial .
at the beginning , we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative evidence .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were submitted before we ordered them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we studied with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined , as probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how it is similar to age and home .
little surprising , we trust the people at most , who are most similar to us .
the more we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through ass@@ essments .
when one has less than three references , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation is common simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we learned that trust depends on how much you &apos;re reas@@ onably priced .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you tell too little , for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
if you are told too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , e.g. , &quot; T@@ olle pieces of works in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create with design , create this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
with what we had not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that previously not been covered previously .
the business is running very well for us .
of course , there are times if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have allowed un@@ authorized parties or have been devast@@ ated apartments .
host have to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , if trust has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is hurt when I just think .
dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of call@@ ers was , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , the 123 million nights only had a fraction of a fraction .
because people trusted one another .
if trust works , it can arise wonder@@ fully .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real protection level which save a life , although they don &apos;t know yet properly .
you take one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books .
they can even stay longer without charge any extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay is going .
but these relationships behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of part with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade here .
but it &apos;s just called &quot; rental industry &quot; , the thing is not just right .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lie in part of itself , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is fast to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in every place one would visit , a group there would wait to have a re@@ plen@@ ish and a bar pent@@ agon @-@ neighborhood , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments from reason to shared ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of a common share ?
I imagine cities that allow us to make society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and shut@@ down .
in South Korean capital of Seoul , this project was already begun . many parking spaces were part of the government ,
those who were offered were offered now . students who were searching for a stay ,
were transported to people whose children were taken out . the incubation programs were launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people will be able to host a stranger or even host at night .
so the idea seems to be so crazy , as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality gave it even before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did it work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the data sharing .
design can help us to overcome profound pre@@ ju@@ dice .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
overwhel@@ m@@ ingly overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da pass over me .
we know , of course , design can not solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think if you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain la@@ undering , a terror deal ?
or just del@@ aying another delay at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
thus , the media people represent , which look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not be Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their u@@ ber riders .
for those who have never met any Muslims , it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ powered espresso -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ian @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I &apos;m a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , Baby , I was not so born .
I decided to have decided .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as a homos@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the ly@@ re was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist independence of independence , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to a perfect and un@@ mistak@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents .
I have the Koran .
I read it , thought , was in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Kor@@ an .
sometimes the beauty of rhythm brings me to wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceived you completely understand , and yet somehow loves ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , sitting at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jum@@ ped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country , but in N@@ u related me the actions of others from a citizen in a susp@@ ect .
that same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember that -- as we drove me -- so deeply it went in my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , when I heard , I saw the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d c@@ auti@@ ous , &quot; &quot; Stay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard from attacks on Muslims , or from people who were to be free for Muslims , into the free and struck .
there was really bran@@ ding on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not felt right .
because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I lost the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was too angry .
it is not easy to explain Himself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays , we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when are we going on ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to serve and close Muslims .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is just the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : an mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is just under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ s@@ cler@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America safer ?
perhaps there will be a few car parks , but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mosque is to consider people of people toler@@ ant more toler@@ ant , and show more civil participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , D.C. recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in front of a computer .
the radic@@ alization process has found that it starts online . as a result , the person is cut off from their church , even by their family that the extreme may believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group as the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their preliminary world , when one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if you throw a look at them , they do not drive them what they are in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that she can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently a amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she would like to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her , that her anger , their sense for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring it into trouble .
of nothing insp@@ ires and something that was given to their anger , she was a major goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m introduced the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed her construc@@ tive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept the IS to join the IS .
that was a gli@@ mp@@ se of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption affect our democracy every day on our freedom of freedom ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ entist - showing : if we fear us , there will happen at least three things .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian governmental system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if you submit reviews messages which was negative about Muslims , they were rather military assault on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims down to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never related to terror attacks .
it happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem Terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to under@@ mining the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims there is an early warning signs .
we feel it as first , but the toxic air of fear does not harm us all .
for the assignment of collective debt , it is not only about to explain ourselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the medical fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did my brother have become a diversi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had arrived in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or did we stay safely at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision ; for it was the reason why the America was left to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion free of charge .
we decided to visit the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and my shoes went out , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to help us .
in that moment , I am collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and emp@@ athy panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose to choose fear and fan@@ at@@ ism at the moment ?
are you going to go to number secure ?
or will you connect to those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks a lot !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with deep aisle works , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usual how it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity to the family , they want jobs and they want to live in peace .
so I am an exception in any way .
if people appear as an exception as a rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is short of being a billi@@ on@@ aire .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package deals in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft carriers in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting plane passengers reach high speed and acceleration onto narrow space .
you can also build self @-@ constantly resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry bur@@ dens and react with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possi@@ bil@@ ty in autonomous flight .
in order to manage an autonomous system , it must know collec@@ tively knowing where mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine which the machine should do .
external commands are available at highest levels . for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
an airplane , trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other starters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the starters , it can ho@@ ver and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very diverse .
however , there is always a swe@@ ep page .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ cut@@ ters is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence like wind turbines .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter what is capable of reg@@ aining the optimum position and improve the performance by exercise .
okay .
during our research , we often provide basic abstract issues to penet@@ rate the core of the cause .
such a question would be : what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mobile parts that con@@ un to viol@@ ate you .
for decades ago , the pilots of remote control units were flying , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear wheel .
we discovered un@@ long we discovered flying with just one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically remote @-@ controlled air device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life is very much , so that it can fly stable and move up in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to get it to fly , I must throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood to throw it exactly , if all of you see , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in genital sin@@ ess , this machine is here , the Omni@@ pot@@ ter with its eight propaganda , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is first symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is adequate in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the exterior ordinary ability ,
moving in all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated , or even as he rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight aircraft .
a lot is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let us see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers aircraft carriers .
this is clock@@ wise in the clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , a bit shy - a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine if also restricted .
we will demonstrate this now , by making a half @-@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic spon@@ ges .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a pal@@ let of aesthetic expression .
we received commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine , as a flying lamp , would like to be flying on Broadway a flying lamp .
of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in development and creative activity .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures allowing it to form a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the clo@@ ak is on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ ies , two black holes are always qu@@ icker , they turned the weight of thre@@ es s@@ uns in a tenth of pure energy .
this short moment brigh@@ tened them brigh@@ ter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole universe .
it was a very big dum@@ b .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , he had just emerged in the earth .
since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sauces , people and -- God stand for us - even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ age@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of C@@ alt@@ ech - build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise through col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a mad gen@@ ius , so that the US National Science Foundation has financed her idea .
after decades of decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ ry Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which improved the performance of detection .
therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ating black holes through the earth through .
they went through you and me
and through the detector passes through .
Scott Hugh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer Science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . it has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and its through observ@@ atories such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ abling in the ti@@ lt of space and time .
when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched and into the other .
lec@@ turers &quot; lec@@ turers &quot; lec@@ turers in courses for Rel@@ ativity theory often do a correct dance on the Rel@@ ativity theory .
&quot; stretch and du@@ kes , stretching and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on September 14 , for example , everyone was stretched and stressed by the waves of the waves . the strain of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the comm@@ a , followed by one 1 . therefore one explained the Lig@@ o &apos;s staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a atomic nu@@ cle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties of the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cist are fin@@ der@@ ful and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or a map of things to perceive the light around you .
in killing is that different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you particularly much :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close to the history behind it .
&quot; now says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob dis@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make any easy pictures of objects in all .
but by changing to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally hear the All .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation is to listen to us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott employs a very long time .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , cat@@ er@@ pillars simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a type of movement sp@@ elling , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I &apos;ll never forget -- it heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ dition sound &#93; J@@ n , who knows what he has to hear , recognize this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn around as fast as the sticks of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : superior to us , what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
put these forces up .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never before .
on this way , we can listen to the All and the invisible .
much in all , we can &apos;t see - practically or basically -- they can &apos;t see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the All .
the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , since this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would like transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the urine is covered by its own neighbour .
thanks to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we never saw , and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found himself in the first run of things we did not expect .
my colleague am MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says about this topic : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the Dinosau@@ rs of the Universe .
they are enormous , ancient body of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sour no@@ ons for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us to find a completely different perspective on the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as only possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
for a year , I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid .
whether it was nervous , I taught me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to begin with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that , when I was afraid , I feared my fear .
my fear , speaking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life on a un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my little .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; kit@@ ten , &quot;
it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her , when I was just in the leap . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I am swe@@ ep to play with them , as soon as you are going to do with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I tell Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m tired .
it has a magical effect on me , upon my children , to our family .
but it has also been an amazing side effect : just before short , I really understood that &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think of things , look for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ate Television . I have TV .
I am doing television , in a big style .
in this TV season I &apos;m responsible for it to put 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show offers hundreds of jobs , which don &apos;t exist before .
the budget for one episode of TV channels can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
one new episode all nine days in four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ cast@@ ers : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series run one another on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments that I myself have created , and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really st@@ ille , creative time to gather my fans at camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re talking about a company , a land or a class@@ room to take me seriously if I say of work , that I do not just walk around the computer , and it &apos;s true , when I say : I understand that it is not about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I moved into work , there is no different feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I put troops back when I painted on a screen .
as a dream you use a high sound , give a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , demanding and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and un@@ distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable , and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is so a change in me when working works well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s li@@ stens to a busy street , I could go for ever on her .
many people assume , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I speak to writing that it is writing me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the Sum@@ men -- when I started to work and work with TV production , when I began to work and work , build and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this power .
the Sum@@ men is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot try different to size .
the feeling , not different to stri@@ ve as to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not for the failure , and I know only that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask them .
to make sure : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more winter@@ ing borders , the more work there is , the more things the same time , the more you watch , the more you write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work , to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love working , isn &apos;t it ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ mers .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , ex@@ agger@@ ated , ex@@ agger@@ ated , ex@@ agger@@ ated .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that her mom is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ onda &apos;s land . &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
they are baby @-@ titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard it .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was made .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked out , no re@@ mor@@ se , do not deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , does not exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum .
in me there was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ mers and the sum@@ mers I was .
so what do you do if that is what you do , the work you love suddenly blowing ?
I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you , the author of the author of Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do it , one likes to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be a ban@@ ker , a painter , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s when you stop the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stop , who is it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart li@@ stens , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; puts me a question .
I am on the way out , late at it and she says , &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I will say no , to be aware of two things :
first , I must say Yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t name me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s come over , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , like you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
nothing is special about it .
we play and play their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read completely from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of the box , can &apos;t do anything but watch out .
I &apos;m focused .
I &apos;m silent .
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are stick@@ y finger and hum@@ id k@@ isses , tender voices , wa@@ xes and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes down and an energy ub comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s remain with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ mers , the working sum@@ s , the titanium ens@@ wear , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are when I say to you who I am when I am writing by programs and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the Sum@@ men is no power and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the Sum@@ men is the river , which comes from the life of life .
the real Sum@@ ms is Self @-@ Con@@ sci@@ ousness and Peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the print of history , which are in recent tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure .
the real Sum@@ men is simple and original .
the real Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this as a rule , so that I can free myself as Work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not well in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
don &apos;t play an@@ sat@@ in to me , how to work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I rather am at the workplace as a home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person would rather than to be a house ?
well , me .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we wander@@ ed around in the garden , and back and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mostly stiff@@ ly , absent and confused .
I always try my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we work with the games ?
you can also say it ! don &apos;t they say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you can hold me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a meeting .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
they have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child is less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me , until they would like to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ir@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and speak my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
each can bring about 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood day !
15 minutes on a slice !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children want to finish .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my welfare , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is considered to be the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; games &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge yourself in 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I get victories . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in training , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why do not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the Sum@@ men came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opened to the energy and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown mel@@ ody that fills me and my soul . you will lead me to new ideas . I use it into full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that Sum@@ men is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum .
the Sum@@ men of Life .
the Sum@@ men of Love .
the Sum@@ men of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s a sni@@ p that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet , I have everything in hand . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ mers . the land I run , the marathon , which I run , the tro@@ ugh , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more it makes this unusual , lasting , naked and new life in me . less titanium -- more !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things , I aw@@ aken for life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little bo@@ umer@@ ical .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more .
Titan@@ en do not have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks a lot .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have lasting , heavy disability .
this is the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical interventions .
in addition , they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known ones , the &quot; deep @-@ enh@@ ancing stim@@ ulation . &quot; impl@@ ant@@ aneous one electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons that improves the neuro@@ logical function .
it really is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which are among heavy trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency .
I often supplied patients with brain @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that brain trau@@ mat@@ a brain pul@@ ls the brain and incl@@ ined the skull bone .
to save life , one has to reduce the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a curved brain mass sometimes .
instead of taking the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissues .
this is no easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue growing , it is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and environments , to thri@@ ve them .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , there was Jean François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
maybe you know from the biological classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has its stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly spread slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed too long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ rum stem cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide the split of the brain .
but why will they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
this is not so certain .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain weight from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells closely as it did Jean @-@ François
and then to mark them color , to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the area of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ ant -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ plant the same cells in weak@@ ened brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched them completely disappeared after a few weeks , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we in vitro in vitro , in the culture .
we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual weapon .
they had to take food pellets from a tablet .
they made it very well .
when they achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we witnessed the mot@@ orized c@@ ort@@ ex range .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hands .
just as it would happen to people , they recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . you recover at a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree from spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , who recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance in front of injury .
it is not as precise and not as fast .
now you see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the tire transpl@@ antation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and later use them .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant them in human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the resources to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need this . &quot;
I definitely will .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look at the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us to allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to choose the patient who evaluate treatments and evaluate it whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , one must apply to a multic@@ entr@@ e study .
one must really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you tell us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West , we make a big mistake to consider it as of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy than the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ge@@ ance .
we believe that capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was declared to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- won &apos;t influence the austerity programs which were realized in Greece .
in that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends who said to me that democracy would abol@@ ished when it would change anything .
at this point , I want to introduce you an economical model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me again , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are common to our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies .
on the topic of waste I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently has threatened our economies .
I call it the &quot; twins summit @-@ parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognise it as the debt mountain that th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt crisis ,
but few recognize his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which are to be an@@ x@@ ious to invest , however , to invest where it would be productive and income , with which one could contribute to the debt of the debt and of all the things that humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds a lot of money until it is compar@@ es with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around , and absolutely nothing to do except stock ex@@ changes and real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ peaks , which are not equal by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest a low demand for investors in which they could not invest . exactly like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who would not kill him , that his son would kill him if he will grow .
un@@ wanted circumstances led the circumstances which lead to it that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
its exceedingly conce@@ al Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents , and especially to finance technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think . but before we proceed , what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy grew too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the priority of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy in due to these inclu@@ sions .
the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she was working the workers of workers , but of them not only the right to free expression of expression , but more important and crucial , which they put the right to political participation in question of state attacks .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t held a long time .
like a candle that sh@@ ines very light , it is also burned quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the US Constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthening the workers , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was drawn into politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy area became a democracy .
in our present @-@ day demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the date of which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ itary struggle between the two instead of the economy gradually mig@@ rated the policy and dis@@ ma@@ stered them .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is due to that one can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics in the economy is divided and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous , which is so sustain@@ ably the animals of which they feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , that she is hungry at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy related to politics as far as the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations growing , political wealth increases , the overall economic demand arises and the managing director of the corporations are to be contrac@@ ted to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ build the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , like in the ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and the foreig@@ ner .
by the way , this is no new idea .
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very special .
the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the workers &quot; workers can only recover through a miracle as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age .
but there is a solution : creating workers &quot; workers !
capitalism does it by replacing low pay@@ loads through automation and robot .
the problem is to separate the problem so long economy and politics are separated , the autom@@ ating the twin peaks are higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we should be re@@ united with the re@@ united field , otherwise we will appear in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements , which he has produced .
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the people in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; or something that is stuck in the machines of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations with the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I want to give you a few examples in all .
in the field of business : please ask a capital market , where you &apos;re working and in which your capital is working with you from a work@@ station to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re working -- is the property of those who work currently in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but not to work therein , and employees who work there , but not to hear more between capital and labour , no major g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ar , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please introduce themselves shortly before our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call them &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government is paying the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country .
imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment instruments are rare .
this is no new idea .
it is basically that John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that , at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united politics and business .
the world , which I describe , is simultaneously liber@@ ated , in which they privileged guests , and Marx@@ ist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you put yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do that , the technological development will generate a so massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries , whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , it is quite relevant to Marx ,
as Hay@@ ek , why am I a liber@@ t@@ ful Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely in@@ vert@@ eb@@ r .
BG : indeed , and now we are there too .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said it . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner you told me what you think about the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the certificate of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area , where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democr@@ at@@ ef@@ ree zone is .
in certain ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today in the 19th century England .
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what can now be observed in China , resem@@ bles very important development , which we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now cast it to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of ra@@ vel@@ iness to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal perspective , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and to deny that a massive recovery line through the euro zone ran , and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity to appear on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion was to reveal this den@@ ial --
unfortunately , the forces in the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continues to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to obtain an economic system which is not over@@ viable , can be saved through political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism in life , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t change any future , if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Harvest ...
if there is a Minister for Finance , or any Minister , who claimed for 6 months in office , especially in such a sharp situation , asser@@ ts that he did not have any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I thought there was a honest interest on pages of the fin@@ er , to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring our government to fall only because they did not want to deal with the Eurozone , which ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t have to admit that she had been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one out of the Tro@@ ika , who imposed upon us this policy , said : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistakes . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive complex@@ es of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
for if they did not survive , the released flip @-@ forces shall be D@@ ä@@ mon@@ isch and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we stri@@ ve to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 that it appears to me , it will be as well as the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
the Roy Price never heard most of them , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision , which met Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for it to produce shows and the content that will produce Amazon .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy could not choose any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located entirely on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this evaluation .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows such as &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted , where , after one has a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of this episodes ? &quot;
this kind of Show .
on the left , here are shows such as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that &apos;s enough to tell you what is going down at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not hesitate to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle output , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy Price wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create success .
he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each shows and sets them online where they can look at every free .
and if Amazon is available for free things , you get in mind , right ?
millions of viewers look at this ep@@ is@@ iti@@ an .
however , they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who receive everything .
you capture when you start the show , when you get rid of what parts you ski@@ ps or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with this data , which show they should produce them .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and resulting from the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time in another company , another manager has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different .
rather than to arrange a contest , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , whose course shows , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a w@@ agon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very competent , data sealed firms .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is that ?
because the logic says somehow , that all should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimised by very powerful computer .
what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis is not working so it &apos;s a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time we have more and more on statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in jail .
if anyone asks here in the United States and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person is good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . it does not mean that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data sealed companies lie in@@ correctly .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is estimated that through data analysis of flu , it can be predicted - by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news of news . the success culmin@@ ated in a release in the &quot; Nature &quot; magazine .
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly doesn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data is able to test firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes .
despite all of this faul@@ ts , data will yield its decisions in life -- on the workplace , in the legal en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer@@ ized Genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I recognized a number of patterns related to successful decisions using data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you are mainly doing two things :
as a result , you put this problem into his individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , you put together the items to deal with a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart , remove them again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help you remove a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to add the parts together and then to come to a decision .
there is another tool . we have all of it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again to deal back , even if the information is incomplete , then , if the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they are also involved in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , where they could not have been able to use all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when she chose TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; let &apos;s say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things are wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and in order to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at that moment .
I &apos;ll get it with a demo demo later .
so far , I have taken some decisions in my life , where I would have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the structure .
so maybe the ball becomes wis@@ er and smar@@ ter and more sophisticated . ultimately , it is on us to make decisions when we want to reach some extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data is still to pay , make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks a lot .
