<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally existed for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter wasn't right?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government determined against Risen and called it to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol for the design of the government to condemn Whistleblower and entertained journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media is not able to protect this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mutigen.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government had knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were long for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government would fall down.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, the Reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than to fail and awnings on statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, is concerned about his phone number,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banks information, its lending service, and even travel services with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and cracks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, it is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the judiciary has more convicted than all the US governments together.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much about their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government has always has more possibilities to exploit all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">Indeed, they can take this from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the night, in a witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that had not been written as circles his book, and it is essentially more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source development system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet's most famous, developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rather than to send an e-mail, go to a news website, like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, such as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot explain any more information, and many of the information that would like to request would be not available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are always developing new espionage technologies that are all vulnerable to us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to ensure that not only technology ator, such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to give Missile data. it is just as important that we protect the next winlefice,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers, and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm hits the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crimes, but to protect our rights rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[3] 3 April 2016 the largest datleck of history has been published. [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for a Declaration.] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for a explanation.] This week we were submitted by news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama-based law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will receive an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages like the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already been very direct consequences too.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has been resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a convoy of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad stationing companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a trace of 2 billion US dollars on Russia's President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children's business, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, who wait nervous upon the next publication, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we go?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens, and not all of their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few are used to hide and suffer - something we have been discussing and unveil for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there was no prominent Americans so far, the scandal that scandal in this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a Datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we'd see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states, less information must be found to create a company as a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This species of the Intransparent in the USA has allowed employees to leave school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters, especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior, which concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a concealed investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as an African minister to bring the suspects money to the US to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all up to a lawyer's lawyer made suggestions as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-meetings. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider these not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who built our hidden investigator suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leading politiker, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may seem surprising, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing would have changed, as if there is always the wealthy and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimist, I definitely see that some things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen ambitions to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took place in political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is recorded in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA has hindered it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used to provide funds in the US and global for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind headlines.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that arise and say: "Intransparent is not good for the business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end through laws this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the Intransparent which enables even this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I have been kidnapped once and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a farm sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed there and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city only and made a road trip throughout the country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He was even worse, "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That's a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me saying, "I have an air-bed. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Go, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I was starred on the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I built here?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of wild sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, to the door tips to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art, which he had bought from me, depends on his classroom today. he is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">It was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold out as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting for waiting to be waiting for?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air strike was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air matratze.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates, and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think, creativity can make it to transform fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment will be able to stay with a designer bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "airmatratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the airbed on the wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham-Omelon tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the reels.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-resident, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus, we presented the investors: "we want to create a website on the people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are passed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allowed him to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all the children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you can rely on things that can be well. we could designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence in design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do so something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a cost sample, which degree trust we embalm.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you from your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlock mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when she open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you'll see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">You can also feel the most guests, if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just once, who actually has Al Gores Handy now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter that he was dictating for the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you some of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had only presented with his name, if he tells how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 denominations that say: "he can really keep it very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A good-through feedback system strengthens trust is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative evidence.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were submitted before we ordered them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We studied with Stanford a study. we examined, as probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how it is similar to age and home.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising, we trust the people at most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">When one has less than three references, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we learned that trust depends on how much you're reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell too little, for example, "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">If you are told too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g., "Tolle pieces of works in your apartment! I make holiday with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create with design, create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we had not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that previously not been covered previously.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed unauthorized parties or have been devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Host have to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, if trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is hurt when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">Disappointment that you hear in the voice of callers was, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million nights only had a fraction of a fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can arise wonderfully.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack because of sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protection level which save a life, although they don't know yet properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You take one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge any extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay is going.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it's just called "rental industry", the thing is not just right.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lie in part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is fast to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place one would visit, a group there would wait to have a replenish and a bar pentagon-neighborhood, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from reason to shared?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to make society and relationships, instead of loneliness and shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital of Seoul, this project was already begun. many parking spaces were part of the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Those who were offered were offered now. students who were searching for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were transported to people whose children were taken out. the incubation programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people will be able to host a stranger or even host at night.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy, as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality gave it even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the data sharing.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome profound prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Overwhelmingly overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda pass over me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain laundering, a terror deal?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just delaying another delay at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus, the media people represent, which look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not be Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met any Muslims, it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-powered espresso -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegian-Fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, Baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have decided.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The lyre was: at that time it was a feminist independence of independence, which I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to a perfect and unmistakable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, was in question, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication that deepened with each reading of the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="284">Sometimes the beauty of rhythm brings me to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone you perceived you completely understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in essence the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, sitting at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam... "" "" ""... "..."... "jihad..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country, but in Nu related me the actions of others from a citizen in a suspect.</seg>
<seg id="302">That same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember that -- as we drove me -- so deeply it went in my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, when I heard, I saw the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Seid cautious," "Stay in well-lit areas," "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard from attacks on Muslims, or from people who were to be free for Muslims, into the free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really branding on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I lost the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was too angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain Himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays, we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When are we going on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims to serve and close Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is just the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: an malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersclerfer and Olympioniken.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps there will be a few car parks, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque is to consider people of people tolerant more tolerant, and show more civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, D.C. recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">The radicalization process has found that it starts online. as a result, the person is cut off from their church, even by their family that the extreme may believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor or from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group as the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their preliminary world, when one recognizes them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam such as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology to their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if you throw a look at them, they do not drive them what they are in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that she can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she would like to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her, that her anger, their sense for injustice in the world, would only bring it into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspires and something that was given to their anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them for their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept the IS to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was a glimpse of the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption affect our democracy every day on our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientist - showing: if we fear us, there will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian governmental system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you submit reviews messages which was negative about Muslims, they were rather military assault on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims down to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never related to terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Moslem Terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to undermining the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims there is an early warning signs.</seg>
<seg id="367">We feel it as first, but the toxic air of fear does not harm us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">For the assignment of collective debt, it is not only about to explain ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the medical faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous person whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my brother have become a diversified young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had arrived in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or did we stay safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision; for it was the reason why the America was left to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to visit the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and my shoes went out, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to help us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment, I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and empathy panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose to choose fear and fanatism at the moment?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go to number secure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks a lot!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TEDTalk, a thinker with deep aisle works, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not deceive. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usual how it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to the family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception as a rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, is short of being a billionaire.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package deals in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft carriers in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting plane passengers reach high speed and acceleration onto narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry burdens and react with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibilty in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to manage an autonomous system, it must know collectively knowing where mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine which the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at highest levels. for example, "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An airplane, trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters, it can hover and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very diverse.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweep page.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgecutters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter what is capable of regaining the optimum position and improve the performance by exercise.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often provide basic abstract issues to penetrate the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand mobile parts that conun to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">For decades ago, the pilots of remote control units were flying, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a rear wheel.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered unlong we discovered flying with just one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically remote-controlled air device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life is very much, so that it can fly stable and move up in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to get it to fly, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it exactly, if all of you see, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in genital siness, this machine is here, the Omnipotter with its eight propaganda, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is first symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is adequate in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the exterior ordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated, or even as he rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propellers aircraft carriers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise in the clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, a bit shy - a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now, by making a half-airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic sponges.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We received commercial micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine, as a flying lamp, would like to be flying on Broadway a flying lamp.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in development and creative activity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures allowing it to form a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the cloak is on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxies, two black holes are always quicker, they turned the weight of threes suns in a tenth of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment brightened them brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the whole universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big dumb.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, he had just emerged in the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauces, people and -- God stand for us - even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech - build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which arise through collidiating black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a mad genius, so that the US National Science Foundation has financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the laser-interferometry Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which improved the performance of detection.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliating black holes through the earth through.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector passes through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer Science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. it has been studied gravitational waves from black holes and its through observatories such as Ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cabling in the tilt of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When crossing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers "lecturers" lecturers in courses for Relativity theory often do a correct dance on the Relativity theory.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dukes, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, everyone was stretched and stressed by the waves of the waves. the strain of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 Nulls after the comma, followed by one 1. therefore one explained the Ligo's staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a atomic nucleus. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves: "the technical difficulties of the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are finderful and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or a map of things to perceive the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close to the history behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob disrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any easy pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by changing to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can literally hear the All.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation is to listen to us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott employs a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, caterpillars simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same circus with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of movement spelling, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I'll never forget -- it heard the following: [Surrendition sound] Jn, who knows what he has to hear, recognize this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which turn around as fast as the sticks of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us, what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Put these forces up.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the All and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can't see - practically or basically -- they can't see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would like transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, since the urine is covered by its own neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thanks to gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we never saw, and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found himself in the first run of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague am MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says about this topic: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo, are the Dinosaurs of the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour noons for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us to find a completely different perspective on the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as only possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and the cosmos of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year, I would say to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of which I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it was nervous, I taught me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to begin with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that, when I was afraid, I feared my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speaking, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life on a unexpectedly. it started with a question of my little.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "kitten,"</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her, when I was just in the leap. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I am sweep to play with them, as soon as you are going to do with them. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I tell Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, upon my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it has also been an amazing side effect: just before short, I really understood that "Yes" -Sagen to play my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think of things, look for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create Television. I have TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am doing television, in a big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I'm responsible for it to put 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs, which don't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of TV channels can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">One new episode all nine days in four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasters: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shipments that I myself have created, and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans at camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you all of you who work so hard if you're talking about a company, a land or a classroom to take me seriously if I say of work, that I do not just walk around the computer, and it's true, when I say: I understand that it is not about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I moved into work, there is no different feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I put troops back when I painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream you use a high sound, give a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, demanding and intoxicating, funny and undisturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable, and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working works well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums listens to a busy street, I could go for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I tell them the sums that I speak to writing that it is writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summen -- when I started to work and work with TV production, when I began to work and work, build and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this power.</seg>
<seg id="618">The Summen is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summen is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot try different to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not different to strive as to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not for the failure, and I know only that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask them.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make sure: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more wintering borders, the more work there is, the more things the same time, the more you watch, the more you write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work, to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the summers.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "kitten, I want to go to Shonda's land."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard it.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was made.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, worked out, no remorse, do not delegate, a Titan sleeps not, does not exist, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the summers and the summers I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if that is what you do, the work you love suddenly blowing?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "Heul you, the author of the author of Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, one likes to be a teacher, a banker, a mother to be a banker, a painter, and knows how to feel the sums when you stop the sums when the sums stop, who is it then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart listens, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waitress" puts me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I am on the way out, late at it and she says, "Mama, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, to be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to all and secondly, she didn't name me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan bin and my sums come over, and here everything changes in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, like you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing is special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read completely from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and lack of the box, can't do anything but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, tender voices, waxes and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes down and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's remain with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The summers, the working sums, the titanium enswear, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are when I say to you who I am when I am writing by programs and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The Summen is no power and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The Summen is the river, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real Summs is Self-Consciousness and Peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the print of history, which are in recent tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real Summen is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real Summen is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me the wrong words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a rule, so that I can free myself as Workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not well in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Don't play ansatin to me, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at the workplace as a home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a person would rather than to be a house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, me.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We wandered around in the garden, and back and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiffly, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always try my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we work with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! don't they say Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you can hold me for naiv, for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">They have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child is less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me, until they would like to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkirfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can bring about 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad-mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on a slice!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children want to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is considered to be the sums to feel a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge yourself in 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I get victories. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in training, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why do not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The Summen came back in my free time. the sums seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opened to the energy and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody that fills me and my soul. you will lead me to new ideas. I use it into full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums that Summen is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summen of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summen of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The Summen of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's a snip that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet, I have everything in hand. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the summers. the land I run, the marathon, which I run, the trough, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more it makes this unusual, lasting, naked and new life in me. less titanium -- more!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think of things, I awaken for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little boumerical.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen do not have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">In addition, they have heard of one of the most well-known ones, the "deep-enhancing stimulation." implantaneous one electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons that improves the neurological function.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which are among heavy tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with brain-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that brain traumata brain pulls the brain and inclined the skull bone.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one has to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a curved brain mass sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of taking the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissues.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue growing, it is comparable to small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and environments, to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, there was Jean François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know from the biological classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has its stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed too long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebrum stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they provide the split of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why will they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain weight from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells closely as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then to mark them color, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the area of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells in weakened brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched them completely disappeared after a few weeks, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplanted the same cells and now remained the cells -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual weapon.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable dexterity level, we witnessed the motorized cortex range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hands.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. you recover at a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree from spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance in front of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the tire transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the resources to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely will.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look at the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to choose the patient who evaluate treatments and evaluate it whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, one must apply to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you tell us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we make a big mistake to consider it as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy than the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable geance.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was declared to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- won't influence the austerity programs which were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">In that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends who said to me that democracy would abolished when it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I want to introduce you an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me again, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are common to our future gloomy and our great, new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that currently has threatened our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins summit-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognise it as the debt mountain that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt crisis,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which are to be anxious to invest, however, to invest where it would be productive and income, with which one could contribute to the debt of the debt and of all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars sounds a lot of money until it is compares with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around, and absolutely nothing to do except stock exchanges and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin-peaks, which are not equal by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest a low demand for investors in which they could not invest. exactly like Ödipus Father, who would not kill him, that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted circumstances led the circumstances which lead to it that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its exceedingly conceal Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents, and especially to finance technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think. but before we proceed, what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course the Athenian democracy grew too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the priority of Athenian democracy in due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that she was working the workers of workers, but of them not only the right to free expression of expression, but more important and crucial, which they put the right to political participation in question of state attacks.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't held a long time.</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very light, it is also burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the US Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthening the workers, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation from politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was drawn into politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy area became a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-day democracies, since the date of which this separation of politics and economy began, an unitary struggle between the two instead of the economy gradually migrated the policy and dismastered them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is due to that one can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power, because the power of politics in the economy is divided and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivorous, which is so sustainably the animals of which they feeds, decimated, that she is hungry at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy related to politics as far as the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations growing, political wealth increases, the overall economic demand arises and the managing director of the corporations are to be contracted to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must rebuild the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, like in the ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very special.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the workers "workers can only recover through a miracle as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating workers "workers!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low payloads through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is to separate the problem so long economy and politics are separated, the automating the twin peaks are higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure that we should be reunited with the reunited field, otherwise we will appear in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy that lets the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements, which he has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the people in "Star Trek" or something that is stuck in the machines of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long conversations with the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I want to give you a few examples in all.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of business: please ask a capital market, where you're working and in which your capital is working with you from a workstation to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're working -- is the property of those who work currently in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but not to work therein, and employees who work there, but not to hear more between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and spar, and ultimately no emporal twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please introduce themselves shortly before our national currencies would have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging markets].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government is paying the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has invested in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment instruments are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically that John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that, at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have, especially in front of the background of a reunited politics and business.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world, which I describe, is simultaneously liberated, in which they privileged guests, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop in a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You put yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do we do that, the technological development will generate a so massive decline in the overall economic demand, which Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries, whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, it is quite relevant to Marx,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, why am I a libertful Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am completely invertebr.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are there too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirr, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said it. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner you told me what you think about the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area, where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratefree zone is.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain ways, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to China today in the 19th century England.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical, regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can now be observed in China, resembles very important development, which we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now cast it to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of raveliness to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal perspective, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make the Eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and to deny that a massive recovery line through the euro zone ran, and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to appear on the basis of Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the forces in the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to obtain an economic system which is not overviable, can be saved through political will and authitarianism in life, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't change any future, if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance ministers?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister for Finance, or any Minister, who claimed for 6 months in office, especially in such a sharp situation, asserts that he did not have any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought there was a honest interest on pages of the finer, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government to fall only because they did not want to deal with the Eurozone, which ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't have to admit that she had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one out of the Troika, who imposed upon us this policy, said: "that was a colossaler mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive complexes of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the released flip-forces shall be Dämonisch and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we strive to strike the way of a post-modern 1930 that it appears to me, it will be as well as the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">The Roy Price never heard most of them, although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision, which met Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for it to produce shows and the content that will produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy could not choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located entirely on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows such as "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicted, where, after one has a season, your brain asks: "where is there more of this episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of Show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here are shows such as "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that's enough to tell you what is going down at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not hesitate to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle output, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy Price wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each shows and sets them online where they can look at every free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is available for free things, you get in mind, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episitian.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show, when you get rid of what parts you skips or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with this data, which show they should produce them.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and resulting from the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of these show can remember because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time in another company, another manager has placed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than to arrange a contest, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, whose course shows, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data sealed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic says somehow, that all should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimised by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">What you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so it's a bit frightening, because we live in a time we have more and more on statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks here in the United States and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person is good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. it does not mean that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data sealed companies lie incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is estimated that through data analysis of flu, it can be predicted - by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news of news. the success culminated in a release in the "Nature" magazine.</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly doesn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data is able to test firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of this faults, data will yield its decisions in life -- on the workplace, in the legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computerized Genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I recognized a number of patterns related to successful decisions using data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you are mainly doing two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you put this problem into his individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, you put together the items to deal with a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart, remove them again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you remove a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to add the parts together and then to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool. we have all of it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again to deal back, even if the information is incomplete, then, if the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they are also involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, where they could not have been able to use all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when she chose TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "let's say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things are wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and in order to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it with a demo demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have taken some decisions in my life, where I would have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes wiser and smarter and more sophisticated. ultimately, it is on us to make decisions when we want to reach some extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data is still to pay, make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks a lot.</seg>
