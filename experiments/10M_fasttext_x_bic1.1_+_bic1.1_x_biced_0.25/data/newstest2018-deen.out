Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your view to the town
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where people will meet today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultiv@@ ates the ru@@ sty ground of peasants .
the oldest official map of Mün@@ chens promotes exciting stories at days .
it is annoying if maps are not currently being updated .
this knows everyone , who had to be exciting , because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlantic gas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort , Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than currently - but just very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then , cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century , as well as cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mercury .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ carpet , one can not recognize as such as such .
in the great overseas map for cities and municipalities more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ anium leaves , were incorporated .
these were created according to the Bavarian Ver@@ mess@@ y Administration between 1810 and 1864 and jumping the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns .
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course to military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally ab@@ ated with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 1801 , the present neighbors , which cre@@ ted the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau - and thus the Bavarian Sur@@ vey@@ or Administration .
the Ur@@ gene blatt for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian state library .
the comparison of early / today is the state capital of the provincial capital .
the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together .
one example is sub @-@ send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after creating the map , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich district .
today , Unter@@ kl@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses were concentrated around 1856 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : in entering zo@@ oming appears a small scale card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten entries from the so @-@ called &quot; urine , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived from .
there are no small plots there today no farmers , but the farmers &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert since the 19th century .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map shows a gli@@ mp@@ se of the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the urine sheet , one reads only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ro &quot; or by the above @-@ level &quot; on the ventilation &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one was once closed to people with flag@@ ration .
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the facility - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought to death by King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anchor of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
in addition , he has under@@ gone the personnel to turn violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
initially there was room for 280 patients , and later on 500 places it was extended .
sometimes this capacity was not enough anymore - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ cuit in hair in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , Germany , has been one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist since 2006 .
in the area of former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt joins the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um in Munich .
the Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth home with training .
the west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings dating from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; established itself in a architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt who had been destroyed during bomb attacks during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was the &quot; main square &quot; in 1856 , called the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße called &quot; Kauf@@ inger Quarter . &quot;
a significant change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Mün@@ ch .
the Allies reached a lot of holes in the inner city in December 1944 .
a big stayed until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once on Mari@@ enhof during these days , and on April 5 , 2017 the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn station .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can compare with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel war@@ nings for Missouri
the National Association for Promotion of Far@@ al has issued a warning for colored people who travel through the discrimin@@ ating policies and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Advisory Board shall come into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of question@@ able , round @-@ related occurr@@ ence in the last time occurs in the whole state and indicated here , &quot; says it in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recent law of Missouri , which makes people more difficult to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that un@@ disp@@ rop@@ ed the group to publish the travel war@@ nings , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights , people going to pass .
they are attacked or killed because of their skin color , they are defeated or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the United States .
the group quoted inci@@ dents like r@@ assi@@ stic violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol taken during the journey by the state of Missouri , and was accused of being accused without a crime .
the Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Missouri , which is shown that black drivers are more common in the state 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff informed about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be willing , if there is a cow@@ or@@ ying money or the relatives know that they are travelling through the state . &quot;
Missouri recorded 100 of them in Hass@@ elt , according to the latest figures from the FBI @-@ amendment of the FBI , who entered the state in terms of the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the travel war@@ nings is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain a company because of living or employment discrimination .
before , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration authorities to negoti@@ ate people because of mig@@ rant workers , which will contribute to further development in the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel war@@ nings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , advoc@@ acy groups have been deployed as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elem@@ ental
the fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU German Bundestag , Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac , have a picture taken on site .
representatives of the fishing family of Schwen@@ n@@ mann met representatives of the fisher@@ man &apos;s CDU local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young@@ sters are cared for and in five apartments Feri@@ ti@@ est .
the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is for him the alternative market@@ ers away for milk of its cows , so swi@@ vel .
a regional one comes on the table of the Feri@@ ti@@ est .
since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the turn@@ out project as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can &apos;t generate steep , steep areas .
the green area , for a lot of work , has to be processed with the engine sense .
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Schwen@@ n@@ mann stressed .
in 2003 , he took over the operation of operation and crops over these without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ lizers , even if he did not conduct bio@@ operations .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the turn@@ out project and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to support farmers .
we hope that the list of areas could still be moved out for a whole while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operations , &quot; the mayor stressed .
farmers are often involved in cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open area is 40 hectares , which must not be applied until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of € 71 500 , half of the leader was promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus , the farmers were able to invest 12 610 Euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of Wei@@ ght@@ au@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ n@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , no farmers and farm women do not go . &quot;
Peter White was also fixed for Peter White : &quot; here , best foods are produced . &quot;
the agricultural policy ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of turn@@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded convey@@ ors .
moreover , the surface area should not be bad ( slopes of 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the request .
for the fishing b@@ acher Weimar project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 km of fence .
the open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty now .
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore , the formation of Saddam Hussein staged on the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN about the proposals of the President to dra@@ stic immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller grab@@ bed the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators had emp@@ tied him , if he had done it .
but he touched their meaning , and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the poem , which you refer to which later , was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively correctly , but how he form@@ ulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance of Lazarus , the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; your tr@@ ash , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who are looking forward to breathe freely , and the end of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller is not committed in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural agreement : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they did a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Rep@@ ublic@@ ans by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice .
and there is himself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing .
the Great Secrets of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not con@@ founded , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead .
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the f@@ ack@@ y should not be enligh@@ tened the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on a bit .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception .
the great ph@@ antom indeed of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were exhausted by the exhausted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships .
it is the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and make a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not be enligh@@ tened , but the hatred that is the only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two sh@@ all@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship race &quot; will have a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland is something special , &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to continue until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ za - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m route , while Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen from the team to the team captain .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ dh is quite modest .
her capit@@ als talk was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very motivated .
the passion and genuine sense , the Ei@@ li@@ ie , of course , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver Medal , which will compete at its fifth world championships at the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; that 16 hits in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another shot , one of them after a great season , which included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembers her first world championships , when the only other Sch@@ otte was on the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the teams capit@@ als says that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only belong to the team , but in some cases also among the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about it is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , making it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as a established ath@@ lete , athletes who want to get on po@@ urs .
what my speech is concerned as capitalist ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
blocking of criticism on Facebook : don &apos;t take you to a public ministry if you don &apos;t want to pre@@ heat the elec@@ tors of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him because of all , from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles .
he sh@@ amed at the cr@@ iti@@ que , certainly .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , as the sheep are led to the battles . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ ogan who must work to work more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons , which have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol@@ a , and the online review was full of a counter response with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary H@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand during the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary funds to combine with his voters and play his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block of persons appearing on the side of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the govern@@ urs and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ s or chambers or h@@ water @-@ filled people using the wh@@ ip .
the post spoke with some of the real people blocked by H@@ ogan .
and these are just true men who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not benef@@ ited .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . was not fulfilled , but she asked for Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same topic , then they will be ab@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the governor as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call others &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; .
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect papers with critical conduc@@ tors and burn them to silence or demonstr@@ ators to silence and to silence .
but exactly this happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ ogan is not the first public officials responsible for it that he imp@@ lies Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a elec@@ torate from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers approached between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter , beat on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous consol@@ es .
the people who used P@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
pet@@ itions , who had critic@@ ised his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , have overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents which were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put them to silence .
freedom , opinion of opinion , and discretion belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days at home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led along the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the final year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acted as a tournament leader in the name of the association &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how to reach his praise with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; it really feels particularly , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; I haven &apos;t able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it took them in the year after I had won it from the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come from last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
it was a really special time and one we will always be appreciated . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came after his 50th birthday this year to the European Senior Tour , returns to the promotion back home .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to make it well , but you also sense this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it has gone . &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ulty .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ Captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are one of the six sh@@ all@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free of charge , the parking place costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this result in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates per year 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking , &quot; study leader Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he went up with his own study on this topic of 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer medicines due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ connections show itself as very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ onably in time , &quot; says the ladder of the building Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the home connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as they are underground in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which always hin@@ der the construction work , is a big problem for the Stum@@ pp of the company Stum@@ pp .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of the drivers in front of red lights and bul@@ locks is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the liner buses are entitled to drive .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the Stum@@ pp company have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
but fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she does not use a stove .
they even rarely use a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ aries in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the captured dum@@ pl@@ ings will be taken with e@@ ager@@ ly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she does not have furniture - where she also conduc@@ ts her daily work , e.g. dresses with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amps .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of their husband were assigned to their fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is usual here .
of course it can be too dangerous . most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are soldiers .
&quot; no one w@@ ned it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the Highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turning quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal notice of it .
in 2003 , the province officially divided into Papua and West Papua New Guinea , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so sec@@ lu@@ ded as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses surrounded by b@@ ambo@@ o f@@ ences , and of corrugated plates which were converted by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians made their journey here , soft because journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an did a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .

Papua New Zealand &apos;s poo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort won gold and copper valued at 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua New resource has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of affliction to the Papua New Guinea , who ensure that Indonesia has retained an initial presence in Indonesia .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local units and units between 1998 and 2004 , nearly 20 million US dollars , among them up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ al demands for larger autonomy thre@@ aten these Golden G@@ ans and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
according to activists , more than 500,000 troops were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped in 1969 by the Indonesian military , tortured and imprisoned .
Mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as Sh@@ es@@ land in the 1970 @-@ s @-@ olds were filed in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone .
&quot; we Bec@@ oming Everything &quot; is called it in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane , which reports from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture ; rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and brutal precipitation of peace demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims each week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
screws are reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring resources to a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development has changed since Muslim economic mig@@ rant workers from the populated island of Java , Borneo , Sumatra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua New Guinea , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai natives who went to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the people and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the ine@@ qualities and the lit@@ igation in Papua New Guinea .
the former carp@@ enter took 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua one has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke on a motorbike due to the darkness .
the rock@@ ing children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and later came back with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , and beat the group with their guns , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers hum@@ bled into the group of children .
a child , who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult to hit the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set up and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field before the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they mour@@ n@@ ingly hunting hunting and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in circle continuously and a bird @-@ care - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E which was not released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ fourth quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for peace and demanded the amount to return home .
no one was able to listen to the atmosphere .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the Che@@ ap spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers would only want to secure their station , because they will be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people threatened to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ers were killed and many more viol@@ ated .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks of Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he had utter@@ ed sympath@@ y for families of victims and swore to go to the historic ab@@ outs in Papua New Guinea .
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; he said .
Secretary of Security , Wir@@ anto , in October 2016 , asser@@ ted that he has a foreign mechanism to proc@@ laim an extra@@ ordin@@ ate historic human rights ab@@ uses .
but the talking started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s years .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to pass through . &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said that he has no plans to set up a complaint in Papua New Guinea .
instead , &quot; everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , who charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; caused more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor in East Timor , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua tim@@ ors were already added , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai proposal .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ mm@@ ing un@@ believers .
&quot; I inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he is still alive for years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I have been afraid of being arrested by the military , being afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was sm@@ itten from the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after he had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the shooting of shooting have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between village dwell@@ ers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers to react with warning shots .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to withdraw the officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rested for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the families of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ land of Papua New Guinea .
many joined the Free Papua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel Army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua New Guinea by pushing out spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ oya .
in response to the last few years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never emerge .
among the people in Papua New Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten site . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just as a range .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a served only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived at the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport in the larger number .
the few jobs that exist in the region will usually go to the better educated and prosp@@ erous migrants .
Papua New Guinea rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
furthermore , restrictions on international media will remain offensive .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Zealand , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign were able to raise the restrictions on reporting to enhance transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
lack of press release means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six @-@ Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Salom@@ onen islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to disgu@@ ise the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people want to be aware that more foreign governments may take this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited his silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anonymous to stay .
Indonesia has got another presidential election to 2019 , but the Papua New states that they probably won &apos;t be back for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , is living under the constant threat of a racial military , is located in arm@@ or educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua New Guinea , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ler led a last symbolic act of p@@ ite : the bodies of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they might never happen to justice , but at least they won &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a direct head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ rise , which is called by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we slept with fire al@@ arms , and at the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , &quot; told a residents whose name was George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection Auth@@ orities said that the units of the fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m. GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooler .
the government said they work on provision of accomod@@ ations for the victims .
the incident may be used for safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high h@@ ubs in all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior covering for decoration or isolation .
in Britain , the police , they believe that the system of records on the insulation and disgu@@ ise of the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a branch that killed about 80 people .
no Davis Cup reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is due to its major Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup singles will only be able to play for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets , which are not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classic remain the traditional score so well .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the countries agreed for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not received the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to work to improve the evaluation .
not only for the vote , after many entries , the proposal had come to place the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements in training places etc are facil@@ it@@ ates and players will have to have less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US trav@@ ellers provides forbidden objects to the plane , finds a survey
a survey among flight passengers found that more than 20 per cent consci@@ ously detected or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items to control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally banned knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they had discovered del@@ ici@@ ously with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey on more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that the younger trav@@ ellers are more mis@@ erable .
of the respondents agreed that they had tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , were members of the X generation .
the most common items that were deliberately tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent claimed to have borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they were deliberately banned drugs into the plane .
the company said that there were trav@@ ellers in the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally , sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware had brought through the airport security , and how many would have been inten@@ tionally done .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who carry on the worst sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - through safety , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company points out that T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ reliable , which liquids are allowed to take away , or how much of it .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the greatest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items prohibited .
for a time the people thought T@@ SA could view books as sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla &apos;s clients cancel order
electro @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to have a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has under@@ min@@ ed that a part of the clients already withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ al numbers of sales growth and more gigantic reduction targets , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k voted for the first time a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k was often recruited with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extradition begins right now .
now Mus@@ k dreamed a : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 were already withdrawn .
critics have always been noted that it &apos;s only for binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 dollars ) and in the UK ( 1000 pounds ) . &quot; booking payment &quot; completely back .
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , admitted to a telephone conference with analysts .
according to the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders to be a problem , Tesla boss believes not .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is planned - all models are taken together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates it to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines without greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum uti@@ lization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the inev@@ it@@ ability of reservations may be a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot hin@@ der un@@ satisfied customers , at least in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt retired due to the execution of the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he had been compl@@ ained of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt took the head of the environmental protection authority to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions Smo@@ g caused by air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved the needs of the state authorities of environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit that had been raised against his prior position in a Federal Appeals Court .
it is a deadline that ran on 1 October for states to stop the standards of 2015 for soil near o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that , in order to comply with his authority in order to study more time to study the plan and to avoid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump of the Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block reg@@ ul@@ ators , or to del@@ aying the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
sudden conversion from Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory agenda agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA ste@@ wards has exceeded his authority as he tried to proc@@ ure the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitoring and reduction of methane le@@ cks .
in a statement on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his cousin in o@@ zone standards simply proposed the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often cited the dead@@ lines for carrying out activists and others in an agreement entitled , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who compl@@ ained to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously .
we also take the law and the authority that there is us seriously . &quot;
nevertheless , the statement of the EPA reported that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; satisfaction to delay , and all other legally available in order to ensure that the regulations &quot; based on a solid policies and the best available information is based . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will push for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
one in the last month of the draft bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules will be delayed by at least eight years .

Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm .

Walter Mart@@ ini st@@ resses : &quot; it is a unique village of small i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ical reference book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the present parish church of Tum@@ lingen , with the Vog@@ tei of Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
the word according to the certificate stood on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the ru@@ sty parish church , except the former parish church , belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as it emerged from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , in addition to the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ ling of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 is under@@ mining this history of history .
the patron Law arose from the early medieval egg y@@ fish .
one Lord , who built a church , held and continued with a parish , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit these egg y@@ ol@@ ks .
he was the right to use a priest , or to propose a new parish in the bishop .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two zer@@ bar@@ ns on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then released in 16@@ 92 , but later he had to be released during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the cr@@ ammed plates were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church cool , and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was canc@@ eled .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm split steep@@ le storm and half collapsed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only today , the present tower remained today as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .

Association wants to check out win@@ ders
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim hin@@ ds &quot; no legal requirements for the construction and therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or .
the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; association ends &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) , invited to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is lawful to be illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines may have been approved , since at the time in fourth , only at the town border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are supposed to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the City of Vier@@ sen had decided to have decided a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but it did not be approved by the Düsseldorf district in Düsseldorf .
&quot; by the lack of scheduled legal requirements , the approval of approval is not illegal after illegal and therefore , &quot; Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is honor &quot; by the lack of legal requirements .
the current state of things : the city council has decided in front of the summer break again the wind@@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a hom@@ olog@@ ation of the District Government is still standing .
narr@@ ative : &quot; this is the issu@@ ance of a approval for the construction of wind power plants were excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter have been received since the fourth week of the circle , &quot; stated a speaker .
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
but it is likely not , however , that the procedure is stopped .
with a view to the administrative court in the administrative court , the circle wanted not to be subject to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area of the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four of 200 metres high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is involved in the middle of four @-@ year contracts with the owners of approximately 65 hectares wide .
with the construction of four wind energy systems , the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - which is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ grown households .
the NEW re will invest some 20 million euros .
in the last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm L@@ inn@@ ich near Aachen , as well as a participating in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor together : woman dies on terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ o@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was hurt .
two more people were injured slightly .
the state road stayed over hours .
after police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ n@@ ich drove to her car as part of the accompanying carriage with their 53 year old mother as accompanying person the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the commercial @-@ club and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to attract residents of the shopping spre@@ e into the city center .
like the chairman of the commercial office , Christian König announced , the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; to make the customers a sensitive service which offers its own town away from the usual supermarket goods .
it is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , native companies are to present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip places .
moreover , the shops of the city centre should invite you to &quot; mit@@ tern@@ ed @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
in this context , the action is not only based on residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation : commerci@@ als on the radio , a internet video and printed bags that point to the stock weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of commerce and industry .
thus , the commercial @-@ club and the city will go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new deals like the first &quot; Active day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with selling sunday , talks with all tra@@ ders and hosts to move them to the active participation .
attractive offers to Saturday and the ren@@ unci@@ ation on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
furthermore , customer potential should be re @-@ rev@@ amped or re @-@ opened .
guests include local guests and tourists .
but many loc@@ als would have lost the downtown shopping center .
in the end , all of them would have to contribute to the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and clubs .
it was said to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network which had taken part , had said King in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in M@@ ühl@@ hausen , announced that the nationwide &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; was held for the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities .
in addition to bathroom Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , sm@@ ug@@ ly , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
the day should be stronger &quot; for appreciation of local trade and its importance to the common good of our cities , &quot; says Stre@@ ich .
the action under the suspension of the I@@ HK and with many partners are also evident that each citizen can still influence its direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump placed after the tran@@ scription of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Leadership from Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone at the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto was invited to stop publicly that he would not pay for a planned cross country .
the US president compl@@ ained to him because he had den@@ ounced the wall publicly . he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first attempt with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a hot@@ ter exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told us that a trade for the United States , who emigrated to Australia , &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , who would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; to ban refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump completed the phone call , after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge by Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out to block his way .
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man @-@ middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer train - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked after testing through the wind@@ shield .
floating the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cry out of the silence , when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , was just a reproduction .
but if a snare is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all in the audience cast a very genuine sig@@ h .
since 2005 , civil rights activists come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State Georgia ( Georgia ) and a life @-@ long civil rights .
for him serves as a dramatic call for acting and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice never corrected .
&quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want the termination , we want healing , we want to reconc@@ ile , but first we need to preserve justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can &apos;t get to cure and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot;
a trial gives a towel about the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI actors , who were received by NBC News were suspected of more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding villages in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none was indicted .
although the susp@@ ect has been on free walking for decades , Citi@@ zens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were always known throughout the city : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court made a choice for the first time in Georgia for the first time to give her voice at the Pre @-@ election campaign in the summer .
about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI of the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the town was that H@@ ester has slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby bought it , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , thus the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they drew near the prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b was round the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison that has prepared the kill@@ ings and ordered , &quot; says this from an FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more impressive .
&quot; it was an electoral massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is illustr@@ ative , mature , and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , of which many believed that he does not exist in America .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are confron@@ ted with its H@@ ug@@ ality in us , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to listen to what I have made . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and loud , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ installed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes Co @-@ Director .
he played the role of the Chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ ker for years , but he said , the role will never be simpler .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room tried the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , the H@@ ester was scre@@ ams and pushed him angr@@ ily that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; I said , &quot; --- he , w@@ ishing from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reply the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene &apos;s laugh at the chief .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; n --- he &apos; said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black performer .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there &apos;s the energy in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with a re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then st@@ illness .
a woman , clothed with a sack@@ cloth , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Che@@ ap &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people were caught up with tears and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many are just down the street .
they have experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , if Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgri@@ mage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the murders have remained a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels rel@@ ish .
if the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the multitude to come closer and the dead bodies are to insp@@ ect .
kids ho@@ cks on their heads , register the counter@@ feit blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ ashed a little boy when he wants to remember .
after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors t@@ oss the Lyn@@ x rope away and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ced two of his players and then breaks in their arms , the emotional load of performance breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; one of women fle@@ es .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets up together with the actors together .
a white couple from Atlanta suggested to a table with a black pair , which she had just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find the words which has left the performance .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people that look like yourself and those things , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds the court at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring , because she describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , Frank Cast@@ orf works on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the shooting stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a fo@@ b street corner with the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR periods or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the Rhein@@ tones would pose as rock@@ ers , or an alternative to Is@@ etta .
the oil waters remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .

later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe in turn .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated with humble and his hands to Merkel @-@ cat@@ ered .
big appl@@ ause is available for the festival orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in superior leisure clothing .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam was expected with tension .

Max Quant@@ ity works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work at several locations in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have also worked in the open day @-@ day at school .
how are your experiences thereby ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , so a late volunteer volunteer .
how does this come ?
quantity : I made SL@@ C .
and then there was a civil engineering , let &apos;s say goodbye successfully .
I recognized for myself , that it is for me the wrong and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself , what do you do .
take a social year , there is a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
in winter semester , I will start my studies in the social affairs .
I will study dual study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne a social worker , and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual while the volunteers have several different locations ?

I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in civil engineering ?
quantity : well sure , here &apos;s not about to reck@@ on the stati@@ cs .
there is always another person in front of the head , each of which have a completely different story behind .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked up out of the family - you have to go individually .
very interesting .
and you had no contact of contact ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
there is a range that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life .
Pear@@ son has a further 3,000 jobs and abbrevi@@ ated the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut out more 3,000 jobs and will cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent since another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is faced .

Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kabul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ bers attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital of Kabul , killing a soldier of NATO and injured several others , officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured , a NATO statement divided .
un@@ confirmed local reports died also three civilians during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence which hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
in an opinion of NATO , the explosion happened on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan Army was attacked by an improvis@@ ation of &quot; by individuals . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and group that is known as so@@ jour@@ ned Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
in late July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in an mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city has killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US led troops invaded the Taliban in 2001 .
violence under@@ scores the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan since US President Donald Tr@@ ump , the number of US troops to support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in Kabul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
EPA returns deci@@ ding to the delay of the smo@@ g rule to pl@@ agues .
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a government regulation of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to termin@@ ate the smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step@@ per .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said , show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement .
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the int@@ ent of the EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country of pollut@@ ant emissions in which one of the country &apos;s damage has to be established in order to delay str@@ ingent quality standards - in order to delay more str@@ ingent quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed an appeal on Tuesday and said that it is illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a wide range of environmental impact , which is imposed by the former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is expected to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
efforts , however , triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and nature groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions to public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ e contains the inhal@@ ation of air which reduces lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
communal space wants to make common room
at the end , the decision was clear : in two objects , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ olds decides the establishment of a common room in the future senior citizens .
in front of discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing basic piece was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas .
although it is still ongoing until the church community is owned by the community , but there is no planning event for the project from a private investor .
there is a discussion concerning a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of area for a special price .
the administration and majority of the community ho@@ wit@@ ched before , such a common room does not take place as a meeting place only for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ atory living spaces , but openly entered into the church .
for example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap .
the decision , which has been prec@@ eded by the provision of funds for the current budget has been pre @-@ determined last autumn .
the construction is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision to sign@@ alize in order to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , no gu@@ ill@@ ets will be le@@ aned between the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ ant - what the tr@@ ump @-@ height reduces and the construction of economic power - it would be possible .
need@@ less , so does not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ o , be this addition .
if it helps : unanimously he passes the panel .
it is not so easy as a common room .
Daniela call refers to the many own buildings , with which you are not so right now , making it the common room from the window , says : &quot; I do so hard to do so . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ y definitely speaks for the communal space - however , absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y of interest , or even foreign investors .
it is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you don &apos;t give a grant , but get a real , in a doubt market value , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s application , according to the resolutions adopted according to the decisions , finds three advoc@@ ates .
so it stays with two counter@@ voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we deal with the decision , we will make a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

walking in the resin of Stern to star
in Har@@ z , the nationwide &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is supposed to be created .
this plan is the club observ@@ atory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there are a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
one &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; will meet the information needs of many re@@ visits , whose name was .
he grants nature , science , movement and sporty performance .
the members want to take up along the planned route tables and inform about stars and stars .
in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ qu@@ eti@@ ze St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and S@@ ieber .
the information on the boards will be complem@@ ented by the Internet .
this is why the site selection is a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star path should be extended by train .
&quot; on the Star pf@@ ad , the viewer experience a lot of knowledge worth knowing , for example , the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was stronger than another , although it is much further away .
also , in which constellation itself find a certain star , and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , located at the highest observ@@ atory observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal National Park of Har@@ z , the location of the Federal National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there come from the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with naked eye clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there are similar simil@@ ar@@ ities of the planet@@ arium in the university in 2003 , like the planned constellation of the Planet@@ arium .
beginning before Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the inside of our solar system , the planet asc@@ ends up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( congregation of the same ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the boards with each of the planets - including the d@@ warf planned down@@ gra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures 75 centi@@ meters above the sun .
the whole distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
during the light of sun up to the plug to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to stand with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
but the march to the next fixing star would last half a year .

when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighting the &quot; perfect magn@@ itude &quot; would be .
&quot; I am a former suspension of fe@@ ather , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to catch a lightweight herr@@ ing .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we are fighting .
that demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
Klim@@ as asked whether it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to arrange a date with Garcia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) of the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ weight battle in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans have asked after him , &quot; said Garcia was ready to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this type of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
he said Lom@@ ach@@ enko , as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise of Garcia and said that he was thinking of River@@ side &apos;s three fight champion from River@@ side , &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to be the co @-@ off . &quot;
Garcia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the moment@@ um created for their own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; said Garcia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I was waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four Last to T@@ ire @-@ boards
in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock lost shortly before the market entry , probably after a tire burst , the control over its vehicle .
the car was tow@@ ed to the right to the squ@@ ad , where he over@@ turned and then moved on the roof in the ridge .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 toward the north for about one hour was locked , afterwards the traffic could pass by the accident on the left .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; dirty chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener , that the optim@@ isation of the def@@ ensive information is in Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as it was not the two opponents in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; we were two opponents too much , and we must fit in au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge mountains , the dirty chain should also be optimized .
and a fool after a fre@@ eway we don &apos;t want to lay down .
&quot; for the future , there will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts itself on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also depends on the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain better than with the qu@@ ette chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is sure of being in the turning chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann is also driving to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if one could speak after a dis@@ mis@@ sive start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could be okay well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and will focus on the cup , we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start in the season I did just after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel who would not like to speak of an advantage over au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony had to be ab@@ orted mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that the player from Au@@ e might even be a bit fresh , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a Ascen@@ sion in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 per cent where they currently stand , &quot; says the defense of the Fort@@ una .
although guests from the Rhineland as a slight favor@@ ites go on Sunday in the meeting ( almost ) final stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundesliga , one has to beat from the front , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Leader coach .
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so I want to experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum test application tests
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested population are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ri@@ char@@ gers ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are supposed to be more accurate during the asylum process of the age of asylum , after the Swedish migration agency ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ c@@ et ) was crit@@ ici@@ zed because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
until today , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ c@@ et 6.@@ 880 has been shipped and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of person is questioned .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson at the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are permanent at the past months .
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has landed on his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; propose that the adult person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det conclu@@ des the 5@@ 81 findings , noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it will be 18 years old .
the medical age assessment method , in the X @-@ ray of Wis@@ dom and MRI images of knee joints become analyzed , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas .
a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later as usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that kind of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it , we shouldn &apos;t do it as if we could say it , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson at the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low .
the biggest risk is in this case , if the person is just under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Light , building manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Reg@@ ulations of Freiburg .
in April the work began at the same time at all three restoration bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the tim@@ etable is held .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch @-@ bow bridge made of concrete , lined with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it is now in the years .
in order to ensure the stability and the traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach passed on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a boundary , which is used as a factory way .

Af@@ ee in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower protest at the potato salad
it &apos;s not so often that parties draw on a beach , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist volcanoes ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites the &quot; great election campaign &quot; according to the &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already before the start of the event , do not want to listen to African athletes , but demonstr@@ ating .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will now take place on the parking beneath the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus just before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers to itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people come together here . &quot;
there are music and a lot of food , among them a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which could also be no problem . &quot; says the woman who brought him with him .
the police sent many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence in particular on the train station , which is just a few metres away from the venues .
how is Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the African volcanic erup@@ tion , he decided to try such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
so now R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes are pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
overlooking the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
this is also doing : at 20 o &apos;clock we are looking forward to a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , diverse speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ Ponti@@ f@@ ical Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young .
in the hall , some 200 listen@@ ers who wait to wait for the German Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k will keep their speech@@ es .
the police presence unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour the Af@@ D event , the guests at the court have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can be removed - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love the cheese , and they shall eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart completely openly about her Bis@@ exual .
&quot; when I add in grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was the one of their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson who ultimately became bitter .
despite all , the brunette performer of the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I changed .
or do you think about it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten had said that they are bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived for du@@ alism and believed in it seriously .
so it never conf@@ uses or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it , not seriously taken seriously . &quot;
particularly among them suffered them , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school time they prefer like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me greatly .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , an@@ x@@ ious and ashamed .
now I look back and think to me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public , they don &apos;t love to love their love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps some of me describe me as a vulner@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself in front of the public . &quot;
West Virginia Governor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will say you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not give the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes states that he owns carbon dioxide in five states , and I inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening gave an explanation , in which it said : &quot; the party changes of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would seem to us rather than to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and not being able to find a positive , reas@@ onably going message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel , in a statement by C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E engaged &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , fi@@ anc@@ ée on Thursday , what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be added again into the sport .
Russia &apos;s ath@@ le@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the prohib@@ itions of his country from the sport was correct and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
he said it was sorry for all athletes who were cut off gold and silver medals in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was voted for maintaining the prohib@@ itions that in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of government sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was an open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e said to rep@@ orters .
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced themselves , that they have experienced some hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
CO@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted to accept that Russia is accept@@ ing the criteria for re@@ deployment .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think progress was achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the wi@@ de@@ ceased system , &quot; he added
n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that start on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
threat tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden trainer are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .

the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city , under high safety arrangements .
to the still un@@ clari@@ fied crash , Secretary of Defence , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CDU ) said nothing .
she described the two sum@@ mer@@ ed pilots but as &quot; C@@ assi@@ ner of her specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old St@@ ain@@ man from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a lam@@ ination of the German army in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .

even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent , declared the soldiers , stated : &quot; if this occupation couldn &apos;t waste the crash , no one would have been mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubt about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not exist : the action is dangerous .
but he was also of high importance , &quot; for a country from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said .
after the funeral service , the swar@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be att@@ ested to his wife after his death .
it divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard did already build a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen &apos;s decision was to agree with the decision of her husband , whose name was in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a H@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ illing of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
in 2016 , he retired and put the title &quot; princ@@ ely Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function , which he wanted to see himself against his wife - not equivalent to death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is ultimately un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later woman , the sympath@@ y of the people always ch@@ ou@@ sted , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand at the Dan@@ es in its barely 50 years .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised .
my Danish was weaker , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ as@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smoke instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco , and who had a reputation to be the brand critical intellec@@ tuals , I couldn &apos;t hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
that were the same two faul@@ ts ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil &apos;s rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
defe@@ at@@ sen@@ sus Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of red @-@ green governmental majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
because he was talking on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the parliament .
before , the surprising exit of a Green party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their cap @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green member of El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she declared in Hannover on Friday .
CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record them .
in this manner , CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is elected regular on January 14 , next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green government had to decide whether they could further reg@@ ain it in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil , however , is indispensable in un@@ holding that the Land@@ tag decides to compl@@ ain his self @-@ solution quickly .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state Constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament draws trust the trust and elect a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these possibilities must be reviewed legally , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; one will discuss any questions in peace if they are legally checked . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the polit@@ ician itself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Green Party called on the down@@ ward member of the return of its landmark .
&quot; of course , &quot; we go out of course that she has received their fellow tag@@ on which she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the president of Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west . &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even before the background , there was no in@@ fest@@ ation differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD @-@ Chancellor of the SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the convic@@ tions of the Sax@@ on Green Party members to CDU as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook .
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ launch the Land@@ tag quickly .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens will cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the polit@@ ician &quot; in its enti@@ re@@ ty , and in her fr@@ ust their personal interests in the presence of the country , &quot; crit@@ ici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to strike the political capital . &quot;
Dutch CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to include El@@ ke T@@ ED into the CDU .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the jack@@ ets before , with the most personal career of career in 2013 .
the CDU was in front of the SPD , the strongest force , the SPD and the Green party had a hau@@ te majority by one voice .
agriculture ministers in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agriculture minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers and consumers , check the eggs in your refrigerator precisely and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the German states represent the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all , we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis campaign - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been shut down immediately and is since dis@@ closure of Germany in the narrow exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
the trade did just like the manufacturer to worry , that the sold products are transported and health un@@ think@@ able .
if at eggs the resi@@ sti@@ est level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not portable .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time not the farms .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to this knowledge , the production plants meet no immediate guilt .
rather , they have to reck@@ on with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of services .
as always there is in the harvest@@ ing case too little cont@@ ex@@ chang@@ ers .
is it only missing on the staff or also on the poor jurisdiction ?
they were just the official controls which have revealed the process .
the truth , however , belongs to the truth that food fraud and criminal energy will never exceed 100 percent .
right now , a consistent enligh@@ ten@@ ment of such events and the hand@@ ing over the gener@@ alities in the cases , in which off@@ ences can be found , of crucial importance .
I have already made several times already , that I expect a full explanation of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm mixing with food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are entitled to right .
by means of ar@@ chery , manufacturers , merchants and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds fibro@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ consuming animals is not acceptable and must be ended immediately .
it has to be applied consistently on all levels and work with high pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is resolved and g@@ rie@@ ve .
how to move to Paris &apos;s finance rules on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent mon@@ stro@@ us issues of the European football matches , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain , because the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEFA &apos;s life , means that PS@@ G must point out sometime , that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar is financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make the money loose with security , so that N@@ ey@@ mar signed and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend much money for the purchase of players , but need to control over the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had enormous debt in their stri@@ ving after success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ently and ris@@ ked to recru@@ it , if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P retired from concentration to the clubs of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P processing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ is still continues to deter them of excessive spending .
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible in the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , making the exp@@ iry of the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is in possession of Manchester City , hit the most heavy sanctions .
the PS@@ G was given a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros , and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season took place on 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players .
the UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to over@@ load their financial view , by sending its revenues through companies that are connected with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ical company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the default market value , the UEFA would not apply as a legitim@@ ate income .
it was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA ruled that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of PSA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments in N@@ ey@@ mar via payments of the Organisation Committee of the 2022 World Cup could be held in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors will be able to find out a small maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is still attentive to consider any attempt to avoid the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke among the condition of An@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not fu@@ cked to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the Association assumes that sales after signing by at least 30 percent is expected .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players go to see and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s leaving direction , claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars the official owner of PS@@ G .
ar@@ senal manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , divi@@ des the reservations from La Liga against a state that has financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is nostal@@ gic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ old gr@@ illing ( &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like it would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by drawing up on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages play g@@ rop@@ es children , who grow up - nevertheless they create the possibility of winning the last part of the Wit@@ ness .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are playing adults , is less emotional ro@@ oted and his par@@ ody is going on more after the casting movies of the 90 @-@ er years , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle ) . &quot;
at one point , a character through a Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line skating and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now novel@@ ist , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ ility .
and there &apos;s another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious plot , included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ age ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the classes are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it makes a lot of fun to see etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d who shows Matt D@@ os sub@@ li@@ pp@@ che of &quot; Singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old st@@ acker .
there are the moments random chance that could buy this fran@@ chise , like a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; will show how they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka . a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers of Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main cast - a hard @-@ sa@@ c Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose dial@@ ogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an in@@ gen@@ ious idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to see ( the police missed the time to watch chess on TV , as Americans perhaps do with football ) .
and the list of the famous spokes@@ persons - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Reagan mask , is involved - that it often plays as a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the imag@@ inary audience &apos;s message is that western culture can do everything for a gel .

impact against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police has succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office was transferred on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 patients aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and issued arrest warran@@ ts against this arrest warrant .
in addition , officials ordered larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
during the same Raz@@ zi@@ en in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in action .
over 300 polic@@ emen were used .
the members of the Mafia was organized by drug abuse , heavy violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and stress .
since the summer of 2016 the public prosecutor &apos;s office was established against organised drugs in the south German room .
between the gener@@ alities in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in particular , Italian relations with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where many shots were fired at the early morning , is likely to go to the bond &apos;s account .
does great g@@ aps compl@@ ains in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : a report that foreigners register significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany .
the lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
the Federal Government for Refu@@ gee Management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has given attention to a media report to great g@@ aps in the expansion of the country .
short@@ com@@ ings of the registered data may result in case of asylum procedures and deportation , &quot; in part in a analysis , which lies in an analysis that lies the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the properties , ten million people with foreign nationals , including 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries , are included in the register .
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 expansion agencies in Germany .
because the data has not been thoroughly maintained , the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who are long no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data inser@@ tion can considerably slow down recur@@ ring , &quot; says the report .
in statistics on a travel bud@@ get@@ ful people , EU citizens should be captured , which would not have to travel .
but such false statements , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on the handling of travelers , &quot; it is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy if they have arrived from there .
it emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re@@ er Zeitung reports . &quot;
therefore , in the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F will lead to such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , except for infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible to find the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees in the EU .
if a mig@@ rant travels across a different EU country , this state may send him back to the country .
for the reasons , the office is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy took hold for reception and accommodation of families guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these comm@@ it@@ ments for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .
internal political spokesperson on the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ pl@@ aten because of short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , human rights and endang@@ ering of child farms . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have reduced the spec@@ ulation about an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with this month fewer members have an increase since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 that the pressure on the budget would continue to continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but they signals that in the next few years of interest rates would be necessary to breeding the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and she said that the loan costs would have to rise more than expected to rise to the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut @-@ economy package that was published prior to Bre@@ xit a year ago .
it will call time for the financial plan to provide cheap funding for banks , although it is said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the scope of this system - with 115 billions of pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent is required than the markets expect .
the markets forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank forecast for this and next year &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disap@@ pointing growth rates increased the rising expectations for a rate of interest and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by increasing inflation and minor distance levels , since the disappearance is still worse before it will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate a part of the lower consumer expenditure .
the decision comes to a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the sin@@ ks .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely .
prior to the last ruling of the Bank on the rate of interest rates , the call had increased after an interest rate , since inflation increased the pressure on hard drives , with three political decision makers in July increased to 0.5 % .
the inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
the bank said that the aims at the ratio of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to be able to take up pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ ale , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market would be more competitive again because the credit lines would be looking forward to stores and would end the year in a positive way .
the market looks especially good for those with the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages include , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment from September after a fight against financing the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that , prior to sexual intercourse , the pre@@ ex@@ position phy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) , which is able to reduce the risk of risk of risk management by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he declared himself to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , according to which the N@@ HS had powers to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the release announced on Thursday , was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England .
pre@@ ex@@ position phy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV compounds that are taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection @-@ endangered .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of one person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come in question , gay or bis@@ exual men , tran@@ ss@@ exual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successful .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , which agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are living in England and are registered in a pedi@@ atri@@ cian , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexu@@ al@@ clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study is intended to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by clinical evidence , which is used to target and implemented in large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; these great new intervention should add the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevention of HIV .
another milestone in the more than three decades persi@@ sting progress in awareness of one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted and dangerous people are targeted , the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people who have high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not with a negoti@@ ation with a partner who leads to improve many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , president of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out rapidly throughout the country , and that no one has left the risk for HIV .
now when the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , sha@@ dows Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation .
the evidence shows how trans@@ forming these drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to it that we will get a step closer to the termination of HIV in society .
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have changed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof for the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much greater space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add yoghurt storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she instructed the Archit@@ ectural Design and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms to place it , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative to solve the presentation .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the top or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it possible Er@@ fan , to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down via the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ r@@ oring plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the best and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel amplifier , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it is important , so that when you move the door , it is very easy to guide . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or as your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary shape , real estate agents are entering and a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials , which make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are things that you touch and they are helping to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform themselves through a good design and increased square @-@ rate of some standard @-@ up to something completely .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not .
brothers fighting for an 500 million US dollar property
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dyn@@ asty , in a conflict because of one of the biggest real estate empire Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to return from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 have accumulated a value of more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family bought a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood since 1973 .
there , West@@ co &apos;s family founded Je@@ ans and grew at a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the Stadt@@ zen@@ rum , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Colin - Paul was described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a judicial file states that this means Colin property has valued at 316 million dollars and Paul in value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a pro@@ filing for Paul .
&quot; the Colin proposed sub@@ divisions have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it .
last Friday , after several failed convic@@ tions , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers also fight for control over the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this was not true , but raises Paul in front of managing some owners .
in an early affair that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to commit the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held accoun@@ table .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants originating from the late 1950 @-@ 80s and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick in the early se@@ venti@@ es .
they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans@@ ing of the family .
Colin says he began West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons .
Luigi spoke often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; brothers , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis @-@ Corporate Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and paid $ 26 million .
for both Luke , as well as Mark , Paul tells us about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made itself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain me and draw our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not know that Paul and I would end in our current contro@@ versy , &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter is going to be solved in the near future , &quot; wrote Colin .
tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , joined his first working day with leading employees , he presented a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to fix : poor information which is going into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the President would make better choices if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ n@@ osis makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by watch out his media pedi@@ gre@@ es .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship for television dates back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; if a candidate was off@@ ended due to an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were too convincing , &quot; said the former election campaign adviser to Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it is under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media sum contains a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever was &quot; under control , &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps these fighter officials know something that we don &apos;t know other - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets could not contain more ignition materials without their interventions .
we will probably never experienced something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff make it already a few times , anger from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently preventing it , Tr@@ ump contro@@ versy calls .
a part of the problem is that people in a white house consists of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Materials , which may promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - busy with this history - reported on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to bring about strategic reasons for strategic reasons .
this was an example of described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he turns out to find out where these are coming from .
exactly that happened in late February when someone accused the President of Got@@ s@@ .com , the website of the web pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was banned permanently from Twitter or that he had offered no concrete evidence , or that he had expressed false accus@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the dump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove itself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors still stri@@ ve for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Master @-@ seeking crimin@@ als get post of Europ@@ ol
since the address is unknown , the people help the people pray and hop@@ ed .
the police arrested in whole Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the most sought @-@ in crimin@@ als are not known as not known , critics are hop@@ ed and pray from the population .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion based on the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; adv@@ ent calendar from the winter .
the experiences had shown that many vol@@ atile and holiday places hide , it was called Europ@@ ol .
I compiled 21 postcards to selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website has been viewed www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ly , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online application could have been arrested , at least eleven of them on the website .
trav@@ ellers over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again tra@@ ded with some ent@@ rails trav@@ ellers on war , which have been tra@@ ded by the congregation in order to rep@@ el a field before their men &apos;s houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
they were brought with horses , babies and an army of transp@@ orters after she had thrown out in May , without being frigh@@ tened by one from the Council excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
the inhabitants of Soli@@ hull have p@@ ushes the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath , where they were thrown onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact , since he was us@@ eless with the problem .
the travelers were in May there , they were moved and are now back .
more came yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
in addition , she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to implement long under@@ lines in order to protect their parks .
I &apos;m not happy to pay on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common stock , if the Council cannot stop this again . &quot;
a resident who would not be called , said , &quot; It is ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of trav@@ ellers only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and even one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of a pri@@ f@@ ug@@ al bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so quickly as soon as possible .
in order to support our mobility collection , it is very important that many people have an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour at the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture from the situation in which the court must consider when we place our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house outside the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ h is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then @-@ called company company mbH , on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights &quot; stay lost annually and proceeds through the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in the fall of 2014 , the numbers of refugees from refugees that entered the district , offered the land@@ lord as a fellow accommodation , offered for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the establishment of a construction plan to secure the territory as a hotel site .
the decision was not disputed in the council at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel site and said already at the time of serious interested visitors at the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ Hotels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians had acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will be called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the previous Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof already since extended time of construc@@ ts container are in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear that extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were torn down , ceilings to the part min@@ ed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be re@@ done in the Black Forest Style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance area is designed , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; beautiful brush@@ g@@ ern@@ ah , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer puts out .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already on a higher city level , emphas@@ izes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with his approximately 60 rooms wants to be broad , explained Sch@@ erer further .
both individuals , groups , or business@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause .
the performances of the city be cover@@ t with the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment asked Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define precisely .
just under one million euros , it reck@@ ons .
the outside plants are also brought to front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace created by the restaurant , which is publicly accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us special negoti@@ ator sets the Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Representative Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report .
the panel has recorded the work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to his own individuals .
the newspaper identi@@ fies the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the broad@@ caster CNN reported that there is already first demonstration of the body in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies acc@@ use Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
there are several men in the focus of investigations into the campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ komm@@ ando Tr@@ ump personally moved into the center and investigate the accus@@ ation , whether the president in the wake of the affair may disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine and decide evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and to decide whether the charges should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called anchor chambers .
mostly they are switched on if there are larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
in addition , the panel can also be switched off from the Public Prosecutor to charge persons under the oath .
according to the stations CNN , preliminary charges have already been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ um@@ ps Consult@@ ant and Kn@@ ap@@ ers@@ son J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that evidence shows that Mu@@ eller should not in@@ timi@@ date in his work and that he should be necessary quickly .
however , it must not be called , that the Grand Jury will be turned on by the end to decide about the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump is a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President of Thursday evening was used to present a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about them . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he knew nothing from the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury .
but this also work normally in obe@@ dience , he stressed .
the White House for@@ ti@@ fies all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent at &quot; f@@ aire &quot; ways .
the former FBI leader James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
we have no reason to assume that something has changed in it , it was said in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
because of this R@@ aus@@ root , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump did ask him to create an investigation against the former National Security Advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president stands under large pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the Special Representative and its employees .
that dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to put away .
unlike an Independent Special Representative of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Nixon took a position later , in which he could be fired on ur@@ ging of the President of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators were set out on Thursday , after which the special negoti@@ ator could not be released so easy .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg is driving in Antarc@@ tica
in the Western Arctic the gigantic ice@@ berg has loos@@ ened from the scar@@ city of barely seven times of Berlin &apos;s scar@@ city .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large Kol@@ oss t@@ oss now to the north and will probably take two , three years until it is melted .
it is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the biggest iron@@ mon@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people doesn &apos;t go out of him .
as a result , climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice cream , is un@@ clear according to research .
for some 30 years , it has been a show of unusual mer@@ ging of ice pl@@ ough@@ s in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the broken column has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s floating on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow closer to the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic peninsula .
North of this sh@@ el@@ fe@@ ises the equilibrium of wa@@ xing was distur@@ bed and dis@@ rup@@ ting some years ago .
a complete scar@@ ce may fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are many things to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is in danger , for the front edge have never withdrawn itself as far as currently .
in addition , the iron table stand under tension and could fall , if there is a piece of keys at a key place .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and p@@ ushes the ice as much water as it yields the melting itself .
however , the loss of the sh@@ ear said that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can reach the sea directly into the sea , and much qu@@ icker than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project for ob@@ serving the Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is after A@@ WI @-@ data with nearly 50 000 square kilometers the fourth largest shadow of the Antarc@@ tica .
on the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural standing and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice plate is now entering a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists is controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra will return again and may merge together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development would take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg to change climate change , so in the past decades , many king@@ fis@@ her of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula are cr@@ ammed .
this long sk@@ irts of the Antarc@@ tica extends South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the polar surface of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase was contributed to decline .
in the past 50 years the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula have war@@ med around three degrees and count towards the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CDU out of the staff at the staff
because it is increasingly difficult to occupy freely @-@ going positions , the CDU , from the Employ@@ ers &quot; to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag 41 new jobs will be eng@@ aging in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind .
the teaching positions in the circle are apparently very desired .
approximately 620 applications were allocated to this year for this year .
nevertheless , the circle further is lacking personnel to manage the A@@ sc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
currently there is a circle of M@@ ett@@ mann in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
among other things , doctors and engineers are searched , as well as forces of general administration .
the CDU wants to join in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag along with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to compete in the management team .
according to the wish of the parties , &quot; a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements of specialists , but to be future @-@ oriented of the applicant &apos;s application .
the overall concept should be oriented according to interior and outw@@ ard@@ ly , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , for CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is by a real &quot; competition of public employer . &quot;
for this purpose , a large number of employees , the disease , or age , comes out of service .
so the t@@ allest time for action thus , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s peoples , leader of the CDU , continues with his party through the joint application .
he already worked in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a big surprise when he publicly presented the personnel cost covering publicly in question and dis@@ continued the remaining parties .
people would like to check out all possibilities that allow a exit from the municipal employers association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the course administration with the trade unions - perhaps also involved in cooperation with the sec@@ ular cities - should stri@@ ve for a pet &apos;s house , so it should be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the CDU , the employees and officials to pay better than it sees the tariff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently oblig@@ atory prescribed , enhanc@@ ements or more money , if you are changing in a higher level , orient@@ ates itself at professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy har@@ dening the sound of NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ our@@ ism
Italy has NGOs working the life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue to continue , if they do not hold new rules for their operations .
&quot; if you do not write a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ n@@ itis War@@ ning was a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; because their crew had been effective effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a fashion that ligh@@ tened the illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself in extensive resolutions of the Italian national Ambro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate in search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organisation in a opinion on social media .
&quot; we can judge all accus@@ ations that are currently collected , only assess that we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , had been supervised since October .
it is thought that its crew members are delivered on board , which can be supplied directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place , only 1.3 miles prior to the Libyan coast , according to the abstract of the national radio , whose content of Italian media was published .
the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast , rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not out of any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of conduct boats , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have taken on board a Italian police officers who monitored their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been explained to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; to their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ n@@ iti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who came to Italy have declined sharply in the past few weeks , causing the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with the local citizen of fruit .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; said the minister .

nine W@@ eil@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin &apos;s out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the far@@ med forest and the pre @-@ bearing levels .
there was always long asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .
again , view point to the look@@ out spot , connected through &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
at the last two days , many al@@ tim@@ eter were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and pal@@ pit@@ ations brought back breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker in the free@@ wheel of the healing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of height , the group had learned the pile of forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga conduc@@ ts for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consol@@ es , instead of shooting through wind and weather across the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high places .
that &apos;s also known the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ ns that are increasingly involved in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg made early in 2015 , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire a brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the Executive Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
he is sure , &quot; that on this move , some clubs still rise . &quot;
the FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organiz@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt saw great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen have now established a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real soccer ball has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be present far more often in these markets , than just once a year to send the Federal lig@@ aments to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA @-@ Simulation FIFA at competitive plane are fo@@ stered .
long ago , like in the normal sport , Li@@ es established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asia play , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a correct sport ?
for many , the performance is safe in need .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y is also involved with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions prove to be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rate , stress re@@ actions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response ability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only work on console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ y but also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a theme . &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sports .
the scientists have positive impact the high @-@ inclusive effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are international on the way , this is like a great global family , there is no inter@@ cultural in@@ hib@@ itions .
a study of corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ sport a rapid growth predic@@ t .
in 2016 there have been 50 million euros in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years the turnover should be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euro of the football @-@ Bundesliga , this is little .
however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
International countries have already been many countries .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there are also some things in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a student , F@@ rob@@ y says .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first league @-@ associations are now committed to D@@ utt , to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; compared to Germany , &quot; V@@ f@@ B @-@ President R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times are to clari@@ fy , is not enough anymore .
it is about to keep the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time to host the modern market .
&quot; we live in an digit@@ alised world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , condemned Conrad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encour@@ ages their friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
Carter was condemned in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is incomplete .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy was l@@ ur@@ red at a mental illness .
in red tro@@ users and a creamy bl@@ ouse , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down to the bottom , when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have Conrad Roy , &quot; said the lawyer &apos;s lawyer .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has not accepted any responsibility , &quot; said she .
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are completely un@@ fortunate . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said that he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity , or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosecutor read a declaration by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was &quot; no day , in whom I do not have the loss of my beloved son .
I want that he is proud of me and how I am with everything I try . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry out for eternity , for his sisters , &quot; says it in it .
Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be persecuted by the realization that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or his aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; not to have this only person with whom I was together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep to me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a real preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime , committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters essays reveal that they had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad , &quot; and &quot; Everything that you must do is to switch to the generator and you will be free and be happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 because of murder of her British fellow resident in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua had allowed the Audi Cup when captain had been running , it is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tru@@ sts in the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation is not given .
anything else in his place in the cabin , that looked at Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra piece was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and also not a Manuel New Testament , he made himself split by him to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not show it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bavaria @-@ captain .
well , the entry would have better run than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also interpre@@ t K@@ imm@@ ich .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a player from youth games , debut album and just out of the holidays coming C @-@ El@@ f as a gam@@ er , but he .
sugar@@ s spread to those who want to give much to those who wants to keep in the mood .
so who was chosen to compete the heir of L@@ ame , a little extra motivation can only be used well .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to take as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old worked as mini @-@ lame on the field .
on the right behind , this is his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this start@@ up such as the one who can take the ru@@ der also best in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ installed tro@@ upe .
he had a look at all , while many others were busy themselves .
Vi@@ dal to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ks hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches come up on the devil ( fol@@ ks only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le come on to fall in their first appearance at the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
that all still fol@@ ks good .
Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the defense of the defense , both retired .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , moreover , Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the play @-@ up .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave that the result was &quot; not so , as we have hop@@ ed for us . &quot;
but he also showed a regular performance at the debut .
game of game : &quot; for this style I was brought together . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still available for new@@ s@@ itions , in connection to the game .
Rud@@ y for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs were not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich retired after a few cris@@ p statements on his back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; what happens here , I have already noticed .
you must simply win every game in Bavaria . &quot;
after all , he must not teach the New Testament .
Al@@ aba motivated Ö@@ FB ladies
David Al@@ aba believes on the success of our Ö@@ FB ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has been reported just before the game on Twitter and the Ö@@ FB ladies desired all the best .
the Bayern Leg@@ ion@@ ary is a quasi @-@ club colleague of Ö@@ FB @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fi@@ e@@ bert with our Lad@@ ys .
Twe@@ et of the Austrian football club of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .

company satisfied with Rheinland @-@ peeled Minister : Economics pra@@ ises the Wis@@ res@@ sings pace
it was often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and regional economy , known as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor economic Minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Knowledge ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ inquiry by a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old female ministry .
Frank Nat@@ us , president of the Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge about the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest cal@@ f@@ ice in infrastructure policy : the bridge connection between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au lies at the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry of Education is hopes to continue the building right up to 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ing Trier , which stands in the pre@@ valent demand of the Federal Rail@@ road .
the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) of Trier , as determined by knowledge , to increase sales in the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
moreover , knowledge have an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the I@@ HK pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incenti@@ ve for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is intended for the stud@@ ded masterpiece and 2500 Euro , when graduates within ten years after the master training will be self @-@ constantly making .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time it is missing the country by the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive director of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the knowledge of business operations , only 29 positions have been occupied until now .
the I@@ HK demands more contracts to external offices .
CDU faction Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the host , the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of regional roads as proposed .
Frank Nat@@ us is also expected to solve a concept of the country like the lack of skilled workers in the region .
there is further broad@@ band cultivation in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the score 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
ex @-@ economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she moved to the field after four months .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face an action campaign
one day before the announcement of Audi told BMW that it would offer you to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ chairman said that &quot; there is more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus sett@@ ling on European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or limit .
Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a call .
European autom@@ akers have strongly funded the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines apply as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , to install the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles from diesel vehicles , take also what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful automobile companies to ignore the sign of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ ting devices to comply with regulations if a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
former manager , Zac@@ oo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be set to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was engaged in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused of having a system installed to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could burden Volkswagen heavy duty : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los F@@ oll@@ ard and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the best published carto@@ ons sig@@ ner , the buttons of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ian is still working and working on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there are too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he struck himself as a sig@@ ner for happiness cards by - which was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most successful day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
following stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded in the late &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again , the artists had been inspired by towns .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures in drawings of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he still sits on the character today , he works almost ten hours daily .
about cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches continue to find a lot of spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the movie wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
this is why he rather sets the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced .
lavender from the Provence is threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the lavender is decl@@ ining due to dro@@ ught in dro@@ ught conditions and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great headache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agr@@ arian Research Institute of CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effective , because the plant was subjected to climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn .
this has imp@@ lications for the lif@@ esp@@ an of lavender .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
lavender oil does not only feel for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also asked for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are being considered , a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ w@@ ishing plants with a shake mixture of sound and water , and the development of varieties that are resistant to dro@@ ught resistant .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ ce meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days in order to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state S@@ inal@@ oa , organised by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and in@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was informed that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack on gren@@ ades , or leave them at home .
safety experts have three words written on a plaque at the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ r@@ ale , allies .
they ask rep@@ orters , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal pain .
there are drug addic@@ tive , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and during the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent , more journalists are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 , after attacks and threats , there were at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter is their publishers and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and his journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
his absence is deeply ro@@ uted , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger at the Ri@@ o@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical Panam@@ anian .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
even though 2010 , a special edition of the Federal Prosecutor was built in order to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders , which are linked every year with drug dealers and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers are only rarely placed before the court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they are still able to treat the violence of S@@ inal@@ oa , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting , and although the terrain is still more con@@ stric@@ ter .
without information about the killer , no justice , the meeting on security of security is little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we do not know why , we susp@@ ect all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was shot out of his car and was shot 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which was translated with &quot; 12th River . &quot;
the arch@@ ers drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January , S@@ inal@@ oa had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions strug@@ gling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in S@@ inal@@ oa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ench@@ anting , two @-@ story Maus@@ oleum for drug addic@@ tions that are larger than many houses for the living .
forget it for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , the publication of an interview with the Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ ons in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release does not hesitate to off@@ end the children , the band members bought every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues knew that he would always be there .
he was working as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars involved in the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce .
in S@@ inal@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without the noise of the poison problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
at the time , the newspaper served a reputation because of the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .
rep@@ orters loved it to publish hard tre@@ ad studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Price &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for protecting journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where they always led them .
he gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug dealers in S@@ inal@@ oa , &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do with so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird that could curse the boy@@ friend , who was generous with h@@ ug@@ s and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sitting at the same table .
now they ask : was his love to be a routine ?
his death also forced them to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions to question how they can do the best and stay alive in the life .
&quot; they don &apos;t like if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their very clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cen@@ sored and self @-@ maintaining .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ ties .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in S@@ inal@@ oa , not just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ ging , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff met by Ri@@ o@@ ce to security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days earlier , y@@ ware that was sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside the heat , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the kid@@ ding , some of the rep@@ orters , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who described the governor himself as not trusted .
it is months ago since rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug tanks must be under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce has cli@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in S@@ inal@@ oa .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted , or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which remained almost the whole century all political levels .
several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ strength corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers had considered the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body muscles .
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers who prot@@ ested against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the staff has become something that they could never expect : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez car@@ ded a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to a further journalist at the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western federal state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists became stronger , as they have written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking distance and building sites .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tried to gather international support for Justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with Governor of S@@ inal@@ oa , on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to express journalists and bring them to the truth because they have said the truth .
it has since then asked that it is divided from the government , because she is concerned that their anger has hurt their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organis@@ ational crimes , involved in government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug candidates , but also on the order of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a blanket .
in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; contributed more than half of the attacks on journalists of police officers and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the kill@@ ings have a horri@@ fying effect .
no one forgot the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern boundary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay down beside its separate head .
some branches have chosen to close how the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do what El man@@ ana von Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly set up the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and looking for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives the drug traff@@ icking him scar@@ c@@ ely .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became reporter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement before the office and drank beer , when all their teleph@@ ones began to sum@@ s .
19 confirmed the dead in a series of shooting @-@ in and security forces near the town of Maz@@ at@@ lan , 19 confirmed the dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ bassies in the region .
from the board of boarding , they released news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers to watch the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the folded founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all S@@ inal@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the pract@@ ition@@ ers asked me about sending them to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find out that his so@@ iled skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of a &quot; un@@ peaceful past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the embroi@@ dered din@@ osau@@ rs that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ lasting condition has researcher who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the Panam@@ anian vegetable f@@ ress@@ ers is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks at the place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil was discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all of this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you have blin@@ king only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible .
&quot; it will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this vegetable f@@ ress@@ er , although it is covered with arm@@ our and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the very strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique , which is known as counter@@ att@@ itudes , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to sof@@ ten his enemies , experts say that it suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family made the head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one by a team that has spent over 7,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ aments on his body .
they discovered the counter sha@@ dy , a widespread defence method in the animal , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their base .
although the console is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds that of the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by flesh f@@ ress@@ ful din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution of the con@@ frontation was fav@@ oured by the con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter sha@@ dy - do think about deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ ds - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs bay was .
scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life , including his constant loan , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died in a river and cast out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor .
at this time Alberta was so warm like South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with tap@@ ered skin , but also in three dimensions and the original form of animal keeping it , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early cra@@ yon period .
you don &apos;t need plenty of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you are only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ op@@ oden , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , passed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex lived , millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal of Current Biology believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea , and was f@@ um@@ ified in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips spread out of his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant her@@ e@@ aters was pushed by the western Canada , until a flooded river it was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater exploration of the din@@ osau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail detail .
the remains of this special specimen are so well received , that the hood still cover hol@@ low tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so rare as a gain in the lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
clo@@ aked remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers moved upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ leng@@ thy - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , around 20 people were injured on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) .
according to the first data of the police against 17.00 , the police stations were no@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , in a row .
there are no information about the exact number of the injured parties .
it took some mild to moderate injuries , the police officer said .
a great deal of ambul@@ ances was on the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a round of ten kilometres was formed .
like a AZ reporter , it also came to massive Dis@@ abilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle en@@ ker , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock the second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue w@@ ren@@ ch was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the she@@ er and w@@ akes an uns@@ el , or breaks the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn test@@ et currently the seam@@ less ticket control .
one is confirmed on the mobile phone that the ticket is taken , so it evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , wide we expect it .
it is expected to be available to many other remote locations in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway of the ticket rank@@ ings without Schaff@@ ner .
to use the use , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what are already most of the passengers already .
it is also necessary to have purchased via the train App , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of the ticket booking anyway .
and last you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works : one goes up in the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
with the test customers , a button for electronic evaluation appears .
the train conduc@@ tors get a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is on the train and taken the booked seating level Y .
comes the train atten@@ dant at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ our@@ able online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep going on , keep silence .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which in turn is to use the passengers .
&quot; who wants to relax without ticket checking through our train personnel , check out in the DB navig@@ ator itself .
this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management of DB Fern@@ Traffic .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to enter into the individual customer requirements . &quot;
those who often travel , knows that in addition to delay and missed trains the ticket controls are one of the biggest sleeve .
for often , in any case , in any case , one of the trav@@ ellers are not all the documents needed for the evaluation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is either missing , or any document that has to be submitted .
the result are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and handling , which leads to a bad mood in the ab@@ ort , del@@ ays and del@@ ays in the control of their own tickets and will take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
it is also available at ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other add@@ numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
only one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook to their phone .
they stum@@ bled across a post by somebody from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; said it there .
confused when nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he post@@ ete a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ pale body that was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours there .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; she thought .
but death was not new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone , to twe@@ ets you on the evening to Twe@@ et on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of police officers and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be the father &apos;s father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
you watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stand before a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ man dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman will be his rif@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled their testimony .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to call ourselves and which we can call it typical . &quot;
in that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two will drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , the strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell ran with her daughter who had a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two a conversation she had countless times in this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her away , &quot; Fer@@ rell said later .
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you must know it and see it up and tu@@ cked up .
it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her experience in which she personally experienced no ec@@ lat@@ ent rac@@ ism , she is not unlike the next black women child .
I feel the feeling I would prove to have a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground towards a camp@@ ground when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepare bags before and helped to pass on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m began to accept Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed totally &quot; after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in the organis@@ ing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later he met Fer@@ rell during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to only &quot; document what happened .
a question occurred Fer@@ rell in the meaning : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around the death of death .
his commitment was closer to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , along with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are depicted , for so I will be represented . &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on fer@@ rel@@ ling experience - to demonstrate that it is dealing with the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but around a community , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participants in the film .
as a result , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &apos;s documents show &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ rel@@ ates life as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that there must be a certain level of injuries at this work and the exploitation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls is the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement that followed the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women need to bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ical type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence even though it was on front of the front , because in a life of these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game .
you can feel their energy by the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police have continued .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social environment of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet they mour@@ ned to a singing and she feels committed to this memorial , since she left for three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the Sü@@ ver of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one at the bit gallery said : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That was real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; doesn &apos;t need any person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ anners ) or simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which the other shops benefit , fear the enemies , that then the pedestrian zone are bleeding .
added : the gallery is planned precisely on the premises , at which the farm market stands , in the 13 direct marketing their products .
the construction work will be concluded with the beginning of the construction work .
the gallery mo@@ vers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Bed@@ a place with the opportunity to sit outside .
Simone room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farmer market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always liked very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher for us .
we would like to wish that during and above all , after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there is also that in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
this is likely to be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; what is the purpose of the shopping cart in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dro@@ ss or supermarkets : I think it is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you see how many shop stores are empty here - some of them for months and years .
since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive .
as you can see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , because the people are often not portable for a reta@@ iler .
too bad , special business@@ man is almost no longer and what is remaining , will then disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peas@@ an@@ try market during the building time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery comes in fact .
or does it have the pen@@ pen@@ st bit gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s simply not work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , does not need any one .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a farm market hall , there are no place thanks to the ins@@ ane market - as I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg has no place anymore .
when the farmer market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ perc@@ ep@@ tible - those attached to cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits have been created by the artist Heather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks tubes and hair sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ tics did a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly made diplomatic messages over the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called a Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their specialized competence in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ lu@@ ous and leaving dis@@ sid@@ y , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and made up of the 30 portraits , as a bit intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many wise men can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has been openly about the identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 for 20 acc@@ es , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age Act , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison its picture was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only a single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing is deliberately sitting on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ ig is associated with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strange arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ umm@@ el and chew@@ ing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were made to un@@ equal bri@@ be , which inter@@ viewed several letters in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; supp@@ ressed images , &quot; who would be predic@@ t a future in which the President of Chel@@ ten@@ se would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was a few days after the book has been published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of happ@@ ily coll@@ ars .
there is also a little while at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender forces to handle new , twe@@ et@@ ting paths which he should actually fix , further fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg was asked after a strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen at a certain reason . &quot;
in a written artistic statement on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for their super@@ script among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name is an end of the &quot; automatic conc@@ ession &quot; whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ ght@@ ful of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; what humans will hopefully bring to what our gen@@ ome is not concerned , who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is one page from the above mentioned comic @-@ Nov@@ els .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States of the United States as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; if they put in cold words , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; it is never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks , of their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , which conver@@ ts themselves as hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
it was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , which were written with their genetic ap@@ olog@@ ations with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; says De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for murder
a nationwide human hunt is in progress for a Professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been sought as susp@@ ects , after a man had been discovered in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the National Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several sticks .
a common warning system published by the police authority in Chicago that the bodies had been discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ ema is now in ur@@ ur@@ gy and had been excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter , which is examined by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man from the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and ready to help us help the US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanting to himself .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he needs the susp@@ ect op@@ pres@@ sive to pursue the authorities .
&quot; the police has an idea of their stay , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police got a phone call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which has just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , the said that in apartment 10@@ 08 was something happened .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident happened on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ ema and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said .
the team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and resear@@ ched a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain state of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA tim@@ etable has been updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko declared on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA plan to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ launch of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything regarding Russia &apos;s cause .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria specified in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the reported investigation by the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in a alleged state sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation by because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has inserted a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something which does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales station R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report lists controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded as part of the d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the WA@@ DA carrying out d@@ oping control in Russia .
it has been allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General of Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved into the right direction to be used again .

start @-@ ups , which will help your company , do not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not mourn .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .
it called people from the outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to carry p@@ olls , speci@@ fying groups and demo@@ graphic groups to deal with professional groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives to apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said she has a better view into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ p@@ olls and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows most complaints and which executives have low access results - so that you can drill up , why .
businesses would come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not have to be involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former collabor@@ ator describes a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 , after the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently signed as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , converting companies makes tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; pulse @-@ &quot; p@@ olls , collect confi@@ dential answers in real time and watch the warmth cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , which can report directly to the workers .
and if the main leader is included , complaints related to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or un@@ ethical , it may experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers @-@ fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , converting to more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their company headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report an issue , he had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said it was not a good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
well , since the company Conver@@ cent is able to find problems , who were sitting in offices in cities or countries , have been hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ sol@@ der pract@@ ition@@ ers - are identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment dispute . &quot;
companies began to take Ethics , Val@@ ues and Employ@@ ees in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen has collapsed due to ethical violations through the Enron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty washing online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and anim@@ ate the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors , which have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the whole capital was raised to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought up his entire funding to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex on research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inser@@ ts .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated to give your time a business with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be able to feel in a company , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience , which uses both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors gain R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio businesses are well run . companies running well when employees are ready and engaged .
if the Analytics tools promise third promise , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you find support .
the data on employee engagement is important after the experts of the workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of a company will not take measures .
in fact , if a company asks for your feedback after your feedback , it may anticip@@ ate that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees can de@@ activate .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen , which have left too much for collecting data .
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; Hab@@ t you really belong to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who passes monthly employee surveys now , was able to guide measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , then Er@@ rett .
and after collecting from the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training within the company to address the problems .
Ruby Tuesday will always get new insights into the staff , and it hopes for a long run that leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is well @-@ known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it is at 23 : 00 , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ players are talking on one side of the new practice fields on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these unlimited minutes are a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses are returning after the three hour exercise , before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 am to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a before Monday was Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and she has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will begin to meet the players already fully @-@ packed time .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the breaking ceremony moved nearly a week after the last season and during the summer school during Mor@@ as six times during Mor@@ as , six times are held at West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August 18 . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change of N@@ CAA support , even if they have to add a further point of time to multiple times .
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; and they simply have pressed them , they gather themselves together , they are great people .
I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , which has been thrown out of the clear si@@ eving of its fields from a adjacent parking place and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been caught with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent there a room and then set aside to record a exercise .
if you have the video from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
I &apos;m not too much worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with mis@@ cellaneous mailing lists from third parties and whose results are shown below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight the called F@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible counter@@ feit messages , which may show results of the results test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , of which many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has become a big political topic in Europe , where the French elec@@ tors were flooded with false stories , and Germany will support a plan to be punished by the social media networks , if they do not succeed , h@@ asser@@ tive Post@@ ings , as before the elections there in September , quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that , in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fac@@ tions ski@@ pped third parties , people want more context to make more profound decisions on what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to be able to test his feature &quot; in conjunction with the article &quot; and in other amendments to its news feed , to decrease false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was an slip hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in K@@ ent River Valley in K@@ ent , and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a thermop@@ ha@@ ari@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that illustrated in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ print on the side of a letter which was written by a double @-@ man in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck !
and letters always smell to smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for nearly four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) seems to be nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and had spent many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena buttons on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of ancient castle , and spoke with land@@ sc@@ ans , gar@@ dening , and sometimes with the artists that worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only granted the full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des hit a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , who represent what had said : &quot; one could mean that landing fli@@ ckers would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let all go down ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to take a wider base in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who is re@@ built the newly built castle to close to the peas@@ an@@ try of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ an@@ try began in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start .
maybe the two are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , telling the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers , which the family Dar@@ rell lived seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell appeared from the 18th century , filled his own funeral by filling a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was first dug later when his Sar@@ g was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be right G@@ aun@@ er to make money and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s males del@@ etes their debt crisis by giving rich old women married - I present them as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise lon@@ ging . &quot;
after the end of his approach in the castle , Rho@@ des went to search of other unique narr@@ ative experience
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wild for a comic @-@ novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind it , the grounds of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been demanded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ eh@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf .
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ eh@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new roof mark on Friday .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF will want to keep the logo and the slogan of Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August , it will be the culmin@@ ation of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think of this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on her yesterday un@@ locked website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
in essence , we are the firm conviction that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ ti@@ veness of our city very well . &quot;
in the promotion , it is going to pass by more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan says it continues .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a gener@@ alized promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot;
finally , she stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a medium @-@ digit amount allows the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f to cost her new roof brand and the campaign .
military forces in Turkey - Earth &apos;s fear of the army
every year , at the beginning of August at Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) was advis@@ able over pension funds and carriage in the Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps .
so this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five vice @-@ president and the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the meetings .
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ number .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the Deputy Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the Com@@ man@@ ure of the He@@ eres , the Air Force and the Navy were buried .
since the failed Cou@@ p , head of Chief Erd@@ ogan 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als failed .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as a wire t@@ aut .
against 4@@ 86 people , who have been involved in the coup attempt immediately , is negotiated for Ankara following this week .
on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan had called the overthrow of the &quot; religious gift , &quot; he gave him the opportunity to complete the armed forces . &quot;
but Erd@@ ogan is really in the handle ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; un@@ eas@@ iness &quot; in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns of concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ism &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests among others in the abol@@ ition of the head ban for sol@@ dat@@ ers , wrote the newspaper .
at least , the big pur@@ ification at the army and security forces goes further .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ ogan sent other 73@@ 95 public officials , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , when Erd@@ ogan was t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they drawn up on appeal to their role as a guard of the world@@ ly state rules .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan urged the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ ogan is targeted targeted by the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a nam@@ ent officer , who , after the coup attempt of fear of persecution , sought for asylum , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this does not meet such development , NATO could not allow Nato .
in the Alliance , there is a doubt in the Alliance for the su@@ peri@@ ority of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operations of operations are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; tell Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it looks ahead to lower the legitim@@ ate immigrants on 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent provisions for vis@@ ing visa requirements and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by going to change the way by citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new evaluation procedure will benefit the Candi@@ dates that speak English to help themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ ction route to race @-@ enh@@ ancing shuttle
again over the past months , over the future of the race @-@ enh@@ ancing was fought - now it is expected to go fast .
before the end of the year it is expected to be built on the travel route , on which the tourist train station will be built .
in order to secure the future of the race @-@ enh@@ ancing alt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , we will begin work on the track in this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the maintenance of the circuit was reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
from that sum up the country take 75 percent .
the contract , on whose foundation the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be coordinated , S@@ üh@@ l explained .
the Ministry and the South Dest@@ ru@@ ingen train as an operator are already included in the technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the used vehicles and quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l .
the planned contract between the Ministry and Rail Company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race shuttle should be ordered in December 2017 .
the gate shuttle is one of all popular railway stations between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ pav@@ ement .
in the past few months , in the course of a pilot company , the track was used by sufficient many people to order them regular in the future .
the circuit is also heavily sto@@ cky in parts .
the ascent of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that in 2017 it can &apos;t even be crazy , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report .
modern swar@@ ms have developed from their infl@@ atable partners in robots with a silicone skin , which feels warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions , which are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robots to its beliefs &quot; and select everything , from the eye @-@ color of the robot through the form of breast war@@ ts up to type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there is still lack of rest , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; who would look out a step@@ ford wife .
modern swar@@ ms have developed to rob@@ otic with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they &apos;ll be appe@@ aling , such as rel@@ ap@@ tern@@ ess .
and then there is still the true Ro@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; with pre@@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; with the impression of rel@@ ent@@ our@@ ism and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that has been adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; weak@@ ened the site of true Compan@@ ion .
so do you like what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its mood in the course of the day - just like real people !
it can be tired of being fixed at conversation or can be &quot; in mood ! &quot;
there are many inci@@ pi@@ ous aspects in this asc@@ ension of sex robots - not least because they have real human relationships - but the under@@ tak@@ ings of female relationships , when you go one step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is in@@ tran@@ qui@@ l one at most .
true to his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; says it on the website .
however , these Sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just a different sexual toys .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement indicate something dark and Ti@@ efer@@ es in our culture , to an withdrawal of the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as optional addition .
most men are naturally not having sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices its increasing popularity , they still remain in the ver@@ ge of consumption culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ ages out of the boundary , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , be very teaching .
and many people are not wei@@ rd or bel@@ ei@@ di@@ ly , until the free market gives permission to this .
there is a certain extent that these highly developed sex robots are immer@@ sed in a period in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , who has ma@@ stered women sexually attacked .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the swallowed body and the stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to represent a physical simil@@ arity to actual women so realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their builder want that they feel deser@@ ted that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robots have no real women .
you can &apos;t separate himself from their companion or simply go away .
you have no placement or background history , nothing that suggests about independence or anything that could inter@@ fere with the imagination .
expressed differently : you are fake slaves .
or to express it in the form of 2017 : maid service
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human beings
it has become a Bin@@ der @-@ eit of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political circuits that have pol@@ arized the US voters to split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ ted@@ dy , there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump selectable relatives .
we are all supposedly told to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ ices has been the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , to accommodate families .
I chose this because my cousin , a left @-@ law@@ ed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
they remin@@ ded me that the unit can have a powerful effect against an enemy .
with tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows whom it knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same page .
in order to protect the dining table , it is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and dump , we refer to the gr@@ assy possibility that his m@@ b will no longer be removed from one day .
however , there is still a frigh@@ tening long @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a ep@@ it@@ ome of reason .
I think I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s official version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both in fact occur in a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York park department , and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ur@@ ry and the animals turn to look full of anxiety about their own shoulders - most glo@@ omy and the k@@ lim@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage , the topic pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience since there are two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and have all a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pull out my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to reduce the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what a neutral exchange should be , but also put pressure on the server to bring person@@ a personality in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store exc@@ use exc@@ use , while I tired the experience , you can submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us abandoned the prison for the second time .
last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of be@@ holding in the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities , according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder of prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of July 2013 , while he shot them several times by a door of the toilet cabin at his home in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al int@@ ru@@ der , hidden in the cabin .
the prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say is to be sigh@@ ted .
the National Criminal Code concluded that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence increases to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the quad@@ ran@@ ug@@ ler from F@@ üt@@ zen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dismissed in the holidays and to the continued schools .
three of the students are going to move into high school , four at the re@@ school .
on Tuesday evening , Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bi@@ es@@ ental headquarters in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students representing Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des chose a young e@@ agles which grows in the chicken , but then released in freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar brought a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it from his chicken .
instead of a poultry guy , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken struck , and the e@@ agles spread out on a high mountain its wings , and escaped .
after that , the classes were three and four in the study of Yv@@ onne Frank .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the eagle stand up for integration , school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte said .
the young lady is different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish every fourth @-@ wat@@ ery that he feels in his new school .
it followed than@@ x to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Mu@@ eller , who always enters into ped@@ agog@@ ical cases , and the par@@ liam@@ ents .
the kitchen @-@ time has now passed , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their students after two years of teaching only very , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the fourth @-@ wat@@ ery .
to be completed , all students were able to sound a song of summer time and holiday .
this broke great joy in the children .
for the new school year , eight original ch@@ ug@@ ler are already registered .

software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
in the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates have offered a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are to improve the emission of emissions of emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine of the ACE car Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that tell Schumann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine .
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Bundes@@ amt Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a fast implementation in the coming months , but not yet called any exact date .
Daimler has informed you to write to everyone .
if anyway , it is due to insp@@ ect a inspection , this will be done in their frame .
how long will the changes in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anine says .
the hang@@ ings of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily negoti@@ ate the car manufacturers at the subject of environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anine .

ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ am@@ orous events in Washington .
the first awards ceremony at President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the prestigious awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , and the chore@@ ograph@@ ers Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) were also known as well .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump is organizing a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the award .
the L@@ ear Foundation announced the progressive TV series , thus already announced to aband@@ on participation in the gala .
the &quot; New York Times &quot; said : &quot; this presidency has decided to neglec@@ t the arts and human rights - they even neglec@@ ted them - and that &apos;s bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ized , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear their visibility .
according to the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among previous premier@@ es are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city busy
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes back to R@@ ente in the coming year .
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
since 31 years , W@@ acker city master has been building master .
and the work is still great fun , as he con@@ veys the press brief@@ ing .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for its success@@ ors .
at the same time , I wonder that so far , no application makes the requirements profile so far .
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or building engineer .
thus , under the contemp@@ t of regular retirement periods - still enough time for a work .
since Has@@ lach was assigned to the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant must refer accordingly .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if she would not fill them anymore , citizens would have to go to the guidance up to Offen@@ burg .
but Bür@@ g@@ ern@@ ä@@ he is the city and himself important , says W@@ acker who reports from a good plant climate and good mood between authority and citizens .
over 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , looking back on the stap@@ ler with pride .
&quot; we are making the city busy , &quot; he is sure about the building office and his staff safe .
but also in the future , varied projects stand on the agenda : the re@@ shaping of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the rainfall @-@ parking lot are attached .
the kin@@ es bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
the latter alone will strike some 1.5 million euros with be@@ ech , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the job here is fun . &quot;
be no@@ blem@@ ish for a city master &apos;s master room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ers can be re@@ acted very flexi@@ bly .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors .
since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to do it , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ating city master emphas@@ ises .
the city master &apos;s high responsibility contributes to the city master .
it is a building , &quot; at the end everything runs here on my table . &quot;
in care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in existence for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified himself with the place . &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important to a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , after information about the town of Has@@ lach , he should have a degree in engineer or Bachelor with technical direction architecture and have good specialized knowledge in the areas of building up and building planning .
building and civil engineering , construction planning , construction planning , under@@ lining planning , urban property management , municipal estate with construction yard and city hus@@ band@@ ages as well as sub @-@ law administration including monument protection .
thrown on bike : South route closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike on the track of the Le@@ aks road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines previously unknown .
these were so severely damaged , that the her@@ ent freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators walk from two male activity and search for the night hours after them .
close to the Tat@@ ort , a pink roller and bike drivers were watched by witnesses .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch said to the A@@ PA .
the or the perpet@@ rators brought himself in large danger and also endangered the train .
in addition to the damage at the Lo@@ k and the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of transport vehicles , P@@ ön@@ als could also be allocated to the perpet@@ rators .
for a total of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be managed without disability .
almost ten persons were out of Friday morning , two of them looked at the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , however , they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters had to be replaced .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meats , dairy products and chocolate may help IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease )
red meats and chocolate can sound as a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products could lin@@ king the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the in@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and bl@@ ends , recur@@ ring or bloody attacks , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected will usually come , meat and dairy products , researchers at the Washington University found that researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins to develop immune cells develop a toler@@ ant intestinal .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immun@@ o@@ deficiency cells in the intest@@ ines are to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide themselves in food , do not enter into the body .
cells that are im@@ able to destroy inflammation , are balanced out of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues .
if the balance is incl@@ ined towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance transported immun@@ o@@ deficiency occur in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ al , and development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an mice had in their diet , the more they had more than these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ rich nutrition is toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able intestinal mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system can work with people .
the post@@ doctoral candidate , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , sought out a kind of immune cell that had found tolerance as it had found that a group of study powers had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which was separated from separately .
she thought that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enced , and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in mice .
mice were tu@@ cked up in a ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they lack@@ ed a gut micro@@ bi@@ ous and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacter@@ ias spread on the immune system , the researchers investigated L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then brought small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a side product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , as these cells can control inflammation on the surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the Chelsea &apos;s 40 million pounds sub@@ title from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid begins , and impressive in the holder roll , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour in the blues and managed to improve the M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve in front of the Premier League season before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u joined the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho to start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to wish three more new releases , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four primary new mandatory .
&quot; three of four to receive , thank you for the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they gave themselves great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky
the US @-@ aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilot flo@@ ps from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in Michigan , and moved into the form of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
the form of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers was to be the form of a Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a test test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising before .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new surcharge for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind revol@@ ves around yet : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the President of the Prime Minister , and Prime Minister , ever met with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no stor@@ y@@ fires from the party headquarters , merely no head@@ wind from the Federation - as loud as the most important wish of the election fighting .
since Martin Schulz introduces the party , it has changed fundament@@ ally .
since then , the employees are watching the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with vig@@ il@@ ting the events in the SPD ruling capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with counter@@ wind in the approach .
there were deep suggestions .
and one after another .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and green .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green is easy to rule , &quot; said CDU Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fac@@ tor@@ sion of a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the country @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
Michael Win@@ ner &apos;s Green Party leader , Michael Win@@ ner , urged to return to his mandate to withdraw their mandate .
the transition to the CDU represents a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and Ele@@ ction of the Gre@@ ens Network of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; it must not be true , &quot; he sigh@@ ed a SPD electoral struggle , when the new hi@@ ther@@ s@@ bot@@ an@@ ity reached the party &apos;s party on Friday morning .
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands after the over@@ coming of the green chi@@ lies El@@ ke T@@ life@@ for CDU without his own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ er started the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , relaxing the com@@ rades of the time .
after the national elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then , too - and it became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to s@@ wap the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ ite , the party was smooth .
the com@@ rades have returned to the weeks later .
then , when she had turned out new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next break .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burnt .
and because he did so much wrong in the crisis communication , that &apos;s what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the state @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister had already been in criticism .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe exactly , because in the past few weeks , because in the past few weeks , they always tried to implement acc@@ ents .
the funeral of the former Mayor of Hannover , from Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , has not been hidden from Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , as they spoke of Weil a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
in doing so , Weil hits no guilt in the party &apos;s party .
and Schulz wasn &apos;t at all .
at times , com@@ rades make the effort to keep its own ranks .
your wrath is directed towards the green , and here , above all on the revol@@ ting par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians in T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ at@@ ry , like Mrs. T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets her own car@@ eers with the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the Part@@ eil@@ lo@@ fts in the SPD Parliamentary Council , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ Mid@@ west is not chosen because of its person as a direct can@@ did@@ ature in parliament , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s European Parliament , so the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ onian member states further .
the logical consequence , it would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the voters before four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Turkish SPD as a leading candidate for the German Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he requested to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or further attendance of the CDU Niedersachsen .
conveyor funds for the site III
those who want to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon be delivered from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler were once again given a review of the events so far .
since 1991 it has been committed to sensation areas .
then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the san@@ itation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous san@@ z@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , and not only to create new areas .
on 4 April , I have received the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which would be 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the commune .
how is a renovation area then ?
you will continue to investigate so in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but there is also a role , whether in the planned field should be interest in any interest .
if necessary , the territory limits could also move once again .
the Ste@@ g compet@@ ed on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal state @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which frames were then carried out .
core of the program are re@@ vit@@ alisation of interior cities , improving the residential and work@@ space and expansion and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be specified , which means per property .
the renovation area would then be set as a stat@@ ute .
since January 1 , 2017 , the approved period of funding has been running until April 1 , 2017 , until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , only once the data will be carried out , in the context of those involved in the renovation area involved a questionnaire to fill in .
in November or December , the submission order is expected to begin with the me@@ z@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that every Commun@@ e had to carry out the disc@@ laim@@ er preliminary investigation .
it is about to evaluate and decide the municipal gri@@ ev@@ ances , and to decide when will be rehabil@@ itated and in which scope .
there will be also a san@@ itation written in the plot also for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again , once again , and establish a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; Building and Basic Law , &quot; where it comes to the structural condition and refurb@@ ishing views .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; budget and housing , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential area .
the blue &quot; Operation arc &quot; is only to be re@@ plen@@ ished when building business rooms are operated .
however , please note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a constant questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .
furthermore , new@@ building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding is made after the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; - who first comes , grin@@ ds first .
one could not be able to reserve funding for later &quot; reservation . &quot;
at the end , photos of the project &quot; outskirts II &quot; were shown to make the presence of a restoration &quot; tasty . &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come with a movement in the house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office door , and can even start his car with a hand movement .

the promotional cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which was up to US manufacturing during the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military that were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states .
the helicopter designed in Connecticut was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi .
the White House White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the recordings of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicop@@ ters arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original aircraft had been during the event during the helicopter , while security personnel was on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the TIM@@ E , the records were not clear , whether ultimately , a second flight crew was required .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal government to use government property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt .
&quot; a question that we created was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the deputy commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
on the event , the President gave up a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to susp@@ end government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
pre@@ sidents are required to use them for the journey .
but your use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation in February in the background of his first campaign aircraft in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the vice @-@ chair of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 con@@ cre@@ ations often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn to continue the US president in the White House with precise Zenti@@ s .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ marks in the White House .
the flight to the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted at the training needs of the air crew for the month , an official .
in addition , Hel@@ icop@@ ter Units flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential supporters . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to issue the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen the US Ministry of Defense for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement unit for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is USD 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the plane will list the flight time of flight over 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of the estimates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs which are included in annual funds . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 the equipment for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press stud of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ending the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent upon it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have been working ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , appropriate to ex@@ iting . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire @-@ fire .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump of Si@@ kor@@ sky spoke to the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the standings S@@ V .
despite five games still f@@ law@@ less balance , the top leader of the second tennis player has received the sense to reality .
in any case , team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which is always playing in quite similar formation .
right at the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V , mainly imports from the far north .
&quot; the Danish and Finn@@ s can even point to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay overlooking Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ mor@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will always be difficult for us .
you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high North stands practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ .
it still manages the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man not to the Bundesliga match , coming to the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec Kol@@ ar Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first use in this season .
so far un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Whit@@ r@@ ussen An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ap@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on the past Sunday against the Club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also put back into the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary who was still the number one of the junior world ranking in January 2016 , someone fills the cad@@ re from the coach to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work as he sat on Wednesday evening under the law to dis@@ appearances the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his order to en@@ act the law , the Congress is a few &quot; un@@ constitutional regulations &quot; in which he corro@@ bor@@ ated .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ ams against the US violation .
after all , the draft on European companies can help protect the Russians , to build gas pi@@ pelines into the EU .
since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV , which jointly co @-@ financed with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life .
twelve weapons are available for him .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed , which the group could defend and which could really hurt him .

role back@@ wards : the town represents 46 Kü@@ ch@@ enh@@ il@@ fen
the city organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch menu .
with solid contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban day@@ care centres .
as of September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , it is a good news : &quot; we all have been very happy . &quot;
it is also cooked except house : a cat@@ er@@ pillar takes over this task and delivers fresh @-@ boiled cooled .
the city operates in the area of 46 pedi@@ ments , in 44 the children get a warm meal in 44 .
last day@@ year Kit@@ a@@ waited 2,@@ 800 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; we do not only eat children who are served 45 week@@ days in K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 participants from the 1st of September kitchen service : they heat up the angel@@ ic meals , supplement it to salad , raw food and fruits , Por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give food out , rooms , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seventh @-@ powered facilities - decides about the tim@@ el@@ ance .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now fixed to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; so they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement the Kit@@ eline magazine simple , educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; the children shall help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in K@@ ita , a person who tru@@ sts to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita premises - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in the future by specialized cleaning personnel .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also contributed to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , which she set out in the cost comparison between self @-@ ra@@ ining and foreign award for the city than the most economic output , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 participants will be re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people at the educational area not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , the reig@@ ning head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women in the provinces are attributed to the provinces . three women tra@@ dic@@ tions for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women can &apos;t be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be really representative and cre@@ dible , if women are unable to participate and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat meetings to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be peac@@ efully handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women have registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ia factory in Glasgow
a union would like to work with managers from the Bis@@ c@@ ite @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ia on the long @-@ term commitment to production in its work in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company sharp@@ ened the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which is located next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives will be &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities are going to change .
in a letter to the branch manager of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ia &apos;s , &quot; Conc@@ ern@@ ing concerns the financing for modernis@@ ing production lines cannot be driven forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win any clarity over the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , as regards our members .
generations of families have been working here and the workers are heavily concentrated on the local community and the Big Room Glasgow , an important column for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged .
therefore , under the perspective of job positions , wage and welfare state , and in front of the Bre@@ xit , increasing life @-@ cost and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly ur@@ gently need a thri@@ ving production line at Mc@@ Vit@@ ia . &quot;
a spokesperson for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ al Manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all the companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business will constantly review and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds , particularly in production lines and operative improvements .
we recognize the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility and quite an . should our business processes change at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga may have regre@@ t@@ ted their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain does not release after having issued an offer of £ 189 million in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , in order to dissolve his free@@ wheel clause , but have been warned at Barcelona three years ago ?
the sensational approach has been heated in the summer until the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is going to become the most expensive player in the world and to the most affordable professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside of the Catal@@ ans , although a source is always given its best to take care of the club since his arrival in Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but the football world was warned about three years ago from the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents ahead of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser had asked Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi a strict warning for anyone who wanted to sign one of the top players from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know that if they have one of our players , we will be able to contact them in opposition , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish Society at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning .
PS@@ G made clear that it would not allow the International Criminal from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .

during the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator has been deliberately thrown into the p@@ inn@@ acle street in front of the property number 30 , and so on the cl@@ adding of the vehicle have been caused by excess of more than 200 Euro .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 0@@ 74@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for notes .
an accident on B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese looks for the police witness .
because a car was hit by car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to sof@@ ten and touch@@ screen the guiding plan@@ ks .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um served in the direction of Le@@ ese at the head of the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um .
in the area of the town of Stol@@ zen@@ au met him a passenger car on his lane , so he had to turn right after the right .
the Tour@@ an driver touch@@ eth the conduc@@ tors .
non@@ damage was created on the car .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued its journey to take care of traffic accident .
it can be good , according to the accident , that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ ier did not notice the accident .
the police will now send witnesses to the fore@@ front , as well as the driver &apos;s driver to set themselves under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ aghetti report ab@@ outs Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ concep@@ tions of the Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ leading sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ing , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after publication opposite the German Press Agency , he was waiting for the Bishop of Reg@@ ens@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Bene@@ dict XVI of Bene@@ dict XVI , an exc@@ use .
it would be very important to see the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have their deepest regret on their own under@@ ings or their then false assessment of the processes .
on the other hand , the Vatican magazine &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; by contrast , critic@@ ised that in the reporting on violence with &quot; two &quot; measure &quot; measures .
in respect of the handles in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the &quot; degree of media mani@@ pulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and a member of the national Italian bio@@ eth@@ ics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis can be found in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you are happy to go to the church and that &apos;s a fallen victim . &quot;
in addition she pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair , today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world changed .
in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese in Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with a high sensitivity &quot; victims , 67 dom@@ est@@ ries sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was held in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be held that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be severe .
nevertheless , contrary to many other def@@ endants , many victims of the general crimes is estimated , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories will unite with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann says , why the final report on the mis@@ fortune sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion was declared .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence against protected men at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row , &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for a rise , many students draw out his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
to the other , it appears as a chol@@ ec@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was tangible for the oil when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance .
how do you use the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and reads all the 440 pages long from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in existence at all .
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will be acquitted clearly by any sus@@ pic@@ ion of mid@@ - or compassion with the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the non@@ violence at the school took place outside of its active sphere .
it can be noted that , in case of which , too late , or first accus@@ ations can not be taken seriously .
the Dom@@ sp@@ ouse gramm@@ ar school , which he worked , was felt by practically all those questioned - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is an excellent witness , describes him as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; sin@@ c@@ ere , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; the boys regularly supplies with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
merely a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ breaks too .
that he did not only threw up with chairs and threw the keys and put on the floor , but also ear@@ ne@@ ying boys in hair or ears , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
however , in his honorary rescue , however , must be said that such correc@@ tive methods in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , widely distributed , with parents such as teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared with what is actually in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the non@@ violence at the pre@@ school , are the liber@@ ally excav@@ ators .
since then , one wonders whether it has not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedikt X@@ VI , that many media has just thrown on him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him are still jeal@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report conclu@@ des Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report , the report was reported very much about the subject of abuse during the bur@@ s@@ bur@@ rows .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger premiered in the final report of any transaction or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : absolutely no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I have never deceived me to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; said an emin@@ ent representative of the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem with enligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they don &apos;t want to become parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ age , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ fortune fail@@ ures ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a more frag@@ ile student had form@@ ulated this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had tim@@ ely evidence ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I hold it ... also for really absurd to assume that it would be reck@@ oned to him ... rather ob@@ tru@@ sive or clear@@ er or rather opened , than in relation to their parents , intern@@ actors , confidence instruc@@ tors etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
thus the report on the very clear result : &quot; that in the run @-@ up students and / or their environment , the study could not be confirmed as part of the study . &quot;
what concerns sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of every co @-@ knowledge .
so it cannot be accused of having brought him or brought him to the display .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to the contradic@@ tory crime , as in some cases unfortunately .
in the media there was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; to read at the bur@@ s@@ bur@@ rows .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of having drawn &quot; directions . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in coverage everything mixed and mi@@ dd@@ led to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
there is also clean separated : between the school and high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence , we say once again , other pre@@ ferences .
in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the conductor of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys were detected and mal@@ ici@@ zed and mal@@ ign@@ ited , all were at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ id states have to rule .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he had the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ ouse gramm@@ ar school .
it was , like most witnesses , the subject &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; Tab@@ u .
it was just happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what else was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ ouse @-@ Gymn@@ asi@@ onal gramm@@ ar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there is no sa@@ wing violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims of the general humanity of R. estimates , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
so , at most , the accus@@ ation still remains .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish and from the predec@@ essors at a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
worn by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ ouse gymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
in this , he insi@@ sts that in the pre@@ school the test was still pract@@ ised . &quot;
even in view of the risk of negative press conferences , he recommended an urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test , was also banned in Bavaria .
before that , it took place in a legal gray zone , as everyone knows about us .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might be ex@@ agger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permissible border had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he had always looked away .
it simply does not agree .
only in 1980 the examination of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and taxis claimed that it is un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards to the then time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we &apos;re talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger to assess the past moral action .
there the princip@@ ality has already been right .
but this is not true , of course , not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was broken up in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against children &apos;s children , that &apos;s already familiar with the back then .
this is all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ in@@ ation and punishment , i.e. , ear@@ ns and ears to draw hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also stopped .
what image of his rainy days , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has been re@@ produced in our conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject test also include the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , told from his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only one side @-@ roll .
nevertheless , in no way , I didn &apos;t forget that he conducted an aust@@ ere regim@@ ent .
but this must be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which I call for un@@ condition@@ ated discipline , it would be hardly possible to form a institution of world @-@ known regim@@ ens , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons , one can now make no big singer and stand before each success , right on which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ win@@ dow@@ ment .
what a man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that I &apos;ve got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , foundations and heart@@ felt people , from which you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something to a fly .
I will receive regularly , how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still working today , 23 years after his Emer@@ iti@@ ation , regularly contact him , reading him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly about them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them the world of music .
and that he always had a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also an ad@@ orable resp@@ ect@@ ful man , to which they are still looking at today and to honor them .
and please , once again clearly : everything one acc@@ uses to him are correc@@ tive methods which were at the time at the time of the agenda .
we can be happy that we have already overcome this time .
but it is very un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and yet another prominent brother , to make media @-@ corn .
there is the evil purpose that stands behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which has just been published , dischar@@ ged him .
now the rising areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would have acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns , and perhaps in Germany , no one would have to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ row , finally in peace .
