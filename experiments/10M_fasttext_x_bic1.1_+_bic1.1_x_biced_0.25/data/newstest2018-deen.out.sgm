<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four cards that change your view to the town</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where people will meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivates the rusty ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Münchens promotes exciting stories at days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not currently being updated.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone, who had to be exciting, because the car Navi took place in a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlantic gas, an offer of the Geoport, Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than currently - but just very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century, as well as cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich Mercury.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a Flickentepcarpet, one can not recognize as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overseas map for cities and municipalities more detailed maps, so-called uranium leaves, were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian Vermessy Administration between 1810 and 1864 and jumping the first surveying of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns in order - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally abated with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, the present neighbors, which creted the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the "Topographic Bureau - and thus the Bavarian Surveyor Administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urgene blatt for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian state library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the state capital of the provincial capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions, and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is sub-sendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after creating the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Unterklling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses were concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: in entering zooming appears a small scale card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten entries from the so-called "urine," from which the basic tax was derived from.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no small plots there today no farmers, but the farmers "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow - and not a concrete desert since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map shows a glimpse of the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the urine sheet, one reads only the street name "at the Gastro" or by the above-level "on the ventilation" - but also in great letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one was once closed to people with flagration.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt "was created on the Auer Lüders."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the facility - that psychiatrist who was brought to death by King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchor of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has undergone the personnel to turn violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">Initially there was room for 280 patients, and later on 500 places it was extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometimes this capacity was not enough anymore - the reason for the construction of the Kreisircuit in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, Germany, has been one of Germany's largest psychiatrist since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of former Auer Anstalt joins the Munich Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">The west is the football field of TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings dating from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" established itself in a architectural rejection to the origin of the Irrenanstalt who had been destroyed during bomb attacks during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was the "main square" in 1856, called the Kaufingerstraße called "Kaufinger Quarter."</seg>
<seg id="45">A significant change brought to the Second World War in the heart of Münch.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies reached a lot of holes in the inner city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once on Marienhof during these days, and on April 5, 2017 the Spatenstich will take place for the second S-Bahn station.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can compare with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Promotion of Faral has issued a warning for colored people who travel through the discriminating policies and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Advisory Board shall come into force by 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of questionable, round-related occurrence in the last time occurs in the whole state and indicated here," says it in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that undisproped the group to publish the travel warnings, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of civil rights, people going to pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are attacked or killed because of their skin color, they are defeated or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that issued the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents like rassistic violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol taken during the journey by the state of Missouri, and was accused of being accused without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers are more common in the state 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff informed about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing, if there is a coworying money or the relatives know that they are travelling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 of them in Hasselt, according to the latest figures from the FBI-amendment of the FBI, who entered the state in terms of the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warnings is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Before, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration authorities to negotiate people because of migrant workers, which will contribute to further development in the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, advocacy groups have been deployed as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elemental</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman's electric fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU German Bundestag, Peter White and Kordula Kovac, have a picture taken on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the fishing family of Schwennmann met representatives of the fisherman's CDU local association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many youngsters are cared for and in five apartments Feritiest.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketers away for milk of its cows, so swivel.</seg>
<seg id="73">A regional one comes on the table of the Feritiest.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach, he described the turnout project as "elemental."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't generate steep, steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area, for a lot of work, has to be processed with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," Schwennmann stressed.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the operation of operation and crops over these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not conduct biooperations.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune recognized the importance of the turnout project and is glad about the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to support farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the list of areas could still be moved out for a whole while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operations," the mayor stressed.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often involved in critique of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area is 40 hectares, which must not be applied until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of €71 500, half of the leader was promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers were able to invest 12 610 Euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of Weightaun.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwennmann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, no farmers and farm women do not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter White was also fixed for Peter White: "here, best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The agricultural policy (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of turnfences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr recorded conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the surface area should not be bad (slopes of 35 percent) and must be threatened by the request.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing bacher Weimar project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 km of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty now.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is, when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore, the formation of Saddam Hussein staged on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic axe in a heated battle with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of the President to drastic immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller grabbed the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty Imitators had emptied him, if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their meaning, and in particular the importance that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta, "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to which later, was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correctly, but how he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the trouble of the poor: "your trash, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who are looking forward to breathe freely, and the end of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not committed in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural agreement: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who wanted to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they did a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republicans by portraying the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is himself a very different name: mother of the exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change the right wing of the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Secrets of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not confounded, but rather an early neo-conservatives to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The facky should not be enlightened the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on a bit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great phantom indeed of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were exhausted by the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and make a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not be enlightened, but the hatred that is the only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two shallots belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship race "will have a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland is something special," and the Athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to continue until we'll find out," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butza - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eiliie Doyle was chosen from the team to the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her capitals talk was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and genuine sense, the Eiliie, of course, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver Medal, which will compete at its fifth world championships at the 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "unbelievably" that 16 hits in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot, one of them after a great season, which included the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Schotte was on the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The teams capitals says that they are "extremely proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only belong to the team, but in some cases also among the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about it is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me, making it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as a established athlete, athletes who want to get on pours.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of criticism on Facebook: don't take you to a public ministry if you don't want to preheat the electors of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him because of all, from the Domestic Policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shamed at the critique, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For in the year 1783, Washington said: "freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, as the sheep are led to the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who must work to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons, which have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as a frivola, and the online review was full of a counter response with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand during the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary funds to combine with his voters and play his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the block of persons appearing on the side of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to as officially and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse the actions of the governurs and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolls or chambers or hwater-filled people using the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just true men who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not benefited.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD. was not fulfilled, but she asked for Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same topic, then they will be abused by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governor as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession".</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect papers with critical conductors and burn them to silence or demonstrators to silence and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials responsible for it that he implies Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a electorate from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers approached between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter, beat on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous consoles.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used Pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who had criticised his position on the contract of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, have overwhelmed his position, according to historical documents which were collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom, opinion of opinion, and discretion belong to the foundation of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club</seg>
<seg id="207">Former Europeans no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days at home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.</seg>

<seg id="212">He is a jealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">Englishman Eales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year career both at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour.</seg>
<seg id="215">"it really feels particularly," said the player in Southport.</seg>
<seg id="216">"I haven't able to defend the Extremadura Open since it took them in the year after I had won it from the program.</seg>
<seg id="217">Back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">The memories come from last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon, last year here.</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we will always be appreciated. "</seg>
<seg id="221">Gary ORR, who came after his 50th birthday this year to the European Senior Tour, returns to the promotion back home.</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be the first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more if you play at home," said ORR, the man from Helensburgh.</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to make it well, but you also sense this additional pressure.</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm glad about how it has gone. "</seg>
<seg id="227">With the trio on the field, the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.</seg>
<seg id="228">ORR and the former Ryder Cup-Captain Sam Torrance are one of the six shallots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.</seg>

<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis election campaign were able to raise the restrictions on reporting to enhance transparency and development.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's unpeaceful provinces of Papua and West papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press release means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>

<seg id="377">He wants to know that Jokowi knows that the Paniai people, apart from that, is living under the constant threat of a racial military, is located in armor educational and health services.</seg>
<seg id="378">Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua New Guinea, consider her voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must pay back.</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says.</seg>
<seg id="380">Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai-Schussler led a last symbolic act of pite: the bodies of a victim was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station.</seg>
<seg id="381">They know that they might never happen to justice, but at least they won't forget their crimes.</seg>

<seg id="407">A survey among flight passengers found that more than 20 per cent consciously detected or unconsciously banned items to control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent, who entered the plane while they accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades.</seg>
<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent claimed that they had discovered deliciously with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey on more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a jet-charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that the younger travellers are more miserable.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents agreed that they had tried to fly with something that was banned from the TSA, 19.7 percent millennials, compared to less than 15 percent, were members of the X generation.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately towed to TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent claimed to have borne objects with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they were deliberately banned drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said that there were travellers in the country to find out how many accidentally, smuggelware had brought through the airport security, and how many would have been intentionally done.</seg>
<seg id="414">It's no surprise that people who carry on the worst smuggelware - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety, those who were most frequently flying.</seg>
<seg id="415">However, the company points out that TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.</seg>
<seg id="416">People are often unreliable, which liquids are allowed to take away, or how much of it.</seg>
<seg id="417">So it's no surprise that the greatest amount of the TSA confiscated items prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="420">Elon Musk is no matter: tens of thousands of Tesla's clients cancel order</seg>
<seg id="421">Electro-thousassa Elon Musk likes to have a huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has undermined that a part of the clients already withdrawn their unbinding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphal numbers of sales growth and more gigantic reduction targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk voted for the first time a different, less glittering number: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk was often recruited with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose extradition begins right now.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk dreamed a: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 were already withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always been noted that it's only for binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (US $1000 dollars) and in the UK (1000 pounds). "booking payment" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations before, admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">According to the cancellation of up to 12 per cent of all orders to be a problem, Tesla boss believes not.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for the ambitious growth target is not in demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">In the past year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018 it is planned - all models are taken together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who today ordered a "Model 3" at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates it to drive its brand new, never in practice tested production lines without greater interruptions with maximum utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to greater delays, then the inevitability of reservations may be a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">For then, the company cannot hinder unsatisfied customers, at least in droves.</seg>

<seg id="449">In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his cousin in ozone standards simply proposed the willingness of EPA to co-operation with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA often cited the deadlines for carrying out activists and others in an agreement entitled," said Pruitt who complained to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"we do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.</seg>
<seg id="452">We also take the law and the authority that there is us seriously. "</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the statement of the EPA reported that Pruitt will eventually use his "satisfaction to delay, and all other legally available in order to ensure that the regulations" based on a solid policies and the best available information is based. "</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans will push for a more comprehensive reconstitution of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">One in the last month of the draft bill, the implementation of the 2015 rules will be delayed by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The intervention was not yet voted for vote in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York-General Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who had promised the EPA in this week, said the Group intend to maintain the statutory pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are affected by the Smog who flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>
<seg id="459">New York closed in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvanien, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="461">The table smog can cause serious respiratory problems, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>
<seg id="462">Representatives of public health industry and the environmentalists rejoiced via Pruitts surprising course change.</seg>
<seg id="463">"it is calm, as much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhale," said Lori Ann Burd from Center for Biological Diversity.</seg>

<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the crammed plates were stolen and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church cool, and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of 1834, a storm split steeple storm and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today, the present tower remained today as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="506">The "Boisheim" association ends "Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU), invited to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is lawful to be illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Boisheimer Nette, no wind turbines may have been approved, since at the time in fourth, only at the town border to Schwalmtal has existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, at the same time, the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are supposed to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the City of Viersen had decided to have decided a second wind force zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but it did not be approved by the Düsseldorf district in Düsseldorf.</seg>
<seg id="512">"by the lack of scheduled legal requirements, the approval of approval is not illegal after illegal and therefore," Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim is honor" by the lack of legal requirements.</seg>
<seg id="513">The current state of things: the city council has decided in front of the summer break again the windconcentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a homologation of the District Government is still standing.</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">But it is likely not, however, that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With a view to the administrative court in the administrative court, the circle wanted not to be subject to the argumentation of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning on an area of the Boisheimer Nette to build four of 200 metres high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is involved in the middle of four-year contracts with the owners of approximately 65 hectares wide.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of four wind energy systems, the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - which is equivalent to approximately one-fifth of all four-grown households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW re will invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">In the last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participating in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the circle Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="591">But none was indicted.</seg>
<seg id="592">Although the suspect has been on free walking for decades, Citizens say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions were always known throughout the city: politics and sex.</seg>

<seg id="604">Cassandra Greene has led the annual reproduction of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.</seg>
<seg id="605">Her representation is illustrative, mature, and is justified in a kind of profound racism, of which many believed that he does not exist in America.</seg>
<seg id="606">It is hard to watch, and even more difficult to look, but Greene said that this is the point.</seg>
<seg id="607">"we don't want to talk about the Lynx, because we are confronted with its Hugality in us," she said.</seg>
<seg id="608">"but I can't build any relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to listen to what I have made."</seg>
<seg id="609">The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and loud, as Greene started a well-installed overview of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="610">Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-Director.</seg>
<seg id="611">He played the role of the Chef-Clanker for years, but he said, the role will never be simpler.</seg>
<seg id="612">"I feel dirty because I am not so," said Marbaugh.</seg>
<seg id="613">"but I think it's very important to get this story alive, because we don't want to return to these times."</seg>
<seg id="614">On the other side of the room tried the actor Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester play their lines.</seg>
<seg id="615">The piece begins with Malcolm, the Hester was screams and pushed him angrily that he slept with his wife Dorothy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"I said," --- he, wishing from my property! "</seg>
<seg id="617">Rascona reply the fire.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is a break.</seg>
<seg id="619">And then everyone breaks (at least all black actors) in laughter.</seg>
<seg id="620">Greene's laugh at the chief.</seg>
<seg id="621">"what?!," said Rascona.</seg>
<seg id="622">He is alarmed and confused.</seg>
<seg id="623">Was I too hard?</seg>
<seg id="624">"no," Greene said, still giggling.</seg>
<seg id="625">"I just don't think white people at that time" n --- he 'said. "</seg>
<seg id="626">"but," one of the other black performer.</seg>
<seg id="627">"you only have to hit the hard 'R.'.</seg>
<seg id="628">And exactly there's the energy in the room, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the uneasiness.</seg>
<seg id="629">Everyone is busy trying to get this right, not just because of the game but also because of memory of the four killed people.</seg>
<seg id="630">The scene starts again.</seg>
<seg id="631">This time Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and with a reprint.</seg>

<seg id="635">A woman, clothed with a sackcloth, stands on the corpses of the actors and leads Cheap "Strange Fruit."</seg>
<seg id="636">Her voice breaks out in every second word.</seg>
<seg id="637">About a hundred metres behind it, a group of about four dozen people were caught up with tears and tears from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="638">The audience is almost equally between black and white.</seg>
<seg id="639">A pair is from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are just down the street.</seg>
<seg id="640">They have experienced almost eight hours of Georgias, if Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombstones of Malcoms and Dorseys.</seg>
<seg id="641">Until this point, the murders have remained a anecdote, but now if one stands on the same country where Lynch-Morde took place, the air feels relish.</seg>
<seg id="642">If the last notes of the songs sound, Greene invites the multitude to come closer and the dead bodies are to inspect.</seg>
<seg id="643">Kids hocks on their heads, register the counterfeit blood and the breastfeeding body and whisper each other.</seg>
<seg id="644">"they are not really dead," mashed a little boy when he wants to remember.</seg>
<seg id="645">After a couple of minutes, Greene of the crowd - and suddenly it's over.</seg>

<seg id="862">With the first seasonal game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, as it was not the two opponents in the 2: 2 against Braunschweig.</seg>
<seg id="863">"we were two opponents too much, and we must fit in aue even better," says the defensive player from Fortuna Düsseldorf.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish asylum test application tests</seg>
<seg id="884">The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested population are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes on the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Richargers) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They are supposed to be more accurate during the asylum process of the age of asylum, after the Swedish migration agency (Migrationscet) was criticized because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, Migrationscet 6.880 has been shipped and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person "may be 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases, conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are only carried out in cases where the age of person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson at the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are permanent at the past months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said the magazine The Local.</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person has been judged more than 18 years, does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has landed on his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "propose that the adult person was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet concludes the 581 findings, noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it will be 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="896">The medical age assessment method, in the X-ray of Wisdom and MRI images of knee joints become analyzed, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, also criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A skeptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus des Karolinska-Institute, whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they went earlier or later as usual by puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that kind of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">To assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">If we cannot say it, we shouldn't do it as if we could say it, "he said to the newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson at the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of tests: "in general, you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">The biggest risk is in this case, if the person is just under 18, this is about 10 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="903">Full in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent monstrous issues of the European football matches, Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain will not disturb.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA's life, means that PSG must point out sometime, that the transfer of Neymar is financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make the money loose with security, so that Neymar signed and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend much money for the purchase of players, but need to control over the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had enormous debt in their striving after success, effectively fraudulently and risked to recruit, if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP retired from concentration to the clubs of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP processing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini had fallen from the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferis still continues to deter them of excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly is FFP not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso who is responsible in the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, making the expiry of the next five years in the amount of €44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is in possession of Manchester City, hit the most heavy sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG was given a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to 20 million euros, and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season took place on 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to overload their financial view, by sending its revenues through companies that are connected with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catarical company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the default market value, the UEFA would not apply as a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA ruled that the value of the sponsorship of PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of PSG payments in Neymar via payments of the Organisation Committee of the 2022 World Cup could be held in Qatar.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s years, for the 90-year-old grilling ("The State" for MTV, and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like it would be short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not just because of its absurd humors (it contained a original story for a speaking tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By drawing up on the core of the gags - actor middle ages play gropes children, who grow up - nevertheless they create the possibility of winning the last part of the Witness.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who are playing adults, is less emotional rooted and his parody is going on more after the casting movies of the 90-er years, like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that cradle the cradle)."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character through a Apple Powerbook, some inline skating and "a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showage), now novelist, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost its virility.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy-malicious plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showage), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always the classes are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It makes a lot of fun to see eternally young Mr. Rudd who shows Matt Dos sublippche of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old stacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments random chance that could buy this franchise, like a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I see as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer:" Wet Hot American Summer: "Wet Hot American Summer" will show how they will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," at the film "Atomic Blonde" and even at "Glow" with its East-West ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka. a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers of Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main cast - a hard-sac Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt will be synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to see (the police missed the time to watch chess on TV, as Americans perhaps do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of the famous spokespersons - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Finde the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask, is involved - that it often plays as a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Impact against drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police has succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, the Schwarzwald-Baar Circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects, as the public prosecutor's office was transferred on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">At the age of 25, 15 patients aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and issued arrest warrants against this arrest warrant.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, officials ordered larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">During the same Razzien in Italy two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two will therefore be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Over 300 policemen were used.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia was organized by drug abuse, heavy violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and stress.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since the summer of 2016 the public prosecutor's office was established against organised drugs in the south German room.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the generalities in Constance and Palermo, a real exchange and investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore the big deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>

<seg id="1229">The Federal Government for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has given attention to a media report to great gaps in the expansion of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Shortcomings of the registered data may result in case of asylum procedures and deportation, "in part in a analysis, which lies in an analysis that lies the" Süddeutsche Zeitung. "</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to the properties, ten million people with foreign nationals, including 5.7 million from non-EU countries, are included in the register.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data are therefore managed by approximately 600 expansion agencies in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data has not been thoroughly maintained, the data quality has not been well maintained in parts so far.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "by people who are long no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"incorrect data insertion can considerably slow down recurring," says the report.</seg>
<seg id="1236">In statistics on a travel budgetful people, EU citizens should be captured, which would not have to travel.</seg>
<seg id="1237">But such false statements, however, led to a distorted debate on the handling of travelers, "it is therefore in the analysis.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently started to return refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy if they have arrived from there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">It emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the "New Osnabreer Zeitung reports."</seg>
<seg id="1240">Therefore, in the paper, the BAMF will lead to such procedures "concerning families with children, except for infants and small children - to Italy since June 1, 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1241">Since the end of 2014, it was practically no longer possible to find the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation.</seg>
<seg id="1242">After the Dublin agreement, the EU state is responsible for refugees in the EU.</seg>

<seg id="1244">For the reasons, the office is now writing: "in the meantime, the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased."</seg>
<seg id="1245">Italy took hold for reception and accommodation of families guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) hold these commitments for sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1247">Other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV preventional treatment from September after a fight against financing the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that, prior to sexual intercourse, the preexposition phylaxes (PrEP), which is able to reduce the risk of risk of risk management by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He declared himself to finance the trial, after the Appeals Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year, according to which the NHS had powers to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The release announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention" while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to follow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October 2018 in the whole of England.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposition phylaxes (PrEP) is a result of HIV compounds that are taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Infection-endangered.</seg>
<seg id="1298">PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of one person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">To those who come in question, gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners that were not successful.</seg>

<seg id="1303">The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much greater space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I showed this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>

<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a covered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add yoghurt storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimal.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she instructed the Architectural Design and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not just a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms to place it, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine, where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative to solve the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>

<seg id="1333">It was not only about building a simple platform but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the top or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it possible Erfan, to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirroring plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the best and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the steel amplifier, veneered MDF-door.</seg>

<seg id="1355">Brothers fighting for an 500 million US dollar property</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a conflict because of one of the biggest real estate empire Victorias worth over 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to return from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, brothers 38 have accumulated a value of more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, Westco's family founded Jeans and grew at a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin - Paul was described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial file states that this means Colin property has valued at 316 million dollars and Paul in value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a profiling for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the Colin proposed subdivisions have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed convictions, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers also fight for control over the existing business - including Colin, as Paul claims to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this was not true, but raises Paul in front of managing some owners.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affair that was submitted by Colin, he says he hope to commit the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports of companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants originating from the late 1950-80s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeansing of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began Westco as he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Luigi spoke often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers "brothers," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis-Corporate Group, whereby Colin claims that Mark paid $10 million in leaving the company and paid $26 million.</seg>
<seg id="1379">For both Luke, as well as Mark, Paul tells us about the conditions of their financial separation. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin made itself very back, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire of the best friend of the television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin answered by SMS, to say "I can really say much," because the case is before the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain me and draw our surname by the courts," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not know that Paul and I would end in our current controversy," he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter is going to be solved in the near future," wrote Colin.</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media Abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, joined his first working day with leading employees, he presented a major problem in president Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to fix: poor information which is going into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the President would make better choices if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump by watch out his media pedigrees.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship for television dates back to decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if a candidate was offended due to an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were too convincing," said the former election campaign adviser to Sam Nunberg in February compared to POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, Trumps Twitter habit is under control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media sum contains a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever was "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fighter officials know something that we don't know other - that trumps tweets could not contain more ignition materials without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experienced something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff make it already a few times, anger from him, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently preventing it, Trump controversy calls.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a white house consists of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Materials, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - busy with this history - reported on the preference of advisors to bring about strategic reasons for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example of described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he turns out to find out where these are coming from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened in late February when someone accused the President of Gots.com, the website of the web provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap to be of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned permanently from Twitter or that he had offered no concrete evidence, or that he had expressed false accusations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the dump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove itself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1429">The travelers have parked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, which is called the "millionaires series."</seg>

<seg id="1433">An anonymous inhabitant said: "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they were thrown onto the passers.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact, since he was useless with the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1435">The travelers were in May there, they were moved and are now back.</seg>

<seg id="1437">In addition, she added: "the Council of Birmingham knows how to implement long underlines in order to protect their parks.</seg>
<seg id="1438">I'm not happy to pay on the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to pay my common stock, if the Council cannot stop this again. "</seg>
<seg id="1439">A resident who would not be called, said, "It is ridiculous, we just have seen the last round of travellers only to be looted by another round.</seg>
<seg id="1440">The numbers have increased this time and even one has even seen a horse in the parking area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">A spokesperson for the Council of Solihull said: "we are aware of a prifugal bearing on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work together with the police of Solihulls. we take the necessary legal steps so quickly as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to support our mobility collection, it is very important that many people have an anti-social or criminal behaviour at the police by calling 101.</seg>
<seg id="1443">This helps to create a picture from the situation in which the court must consider when we place our case. "</seg>

<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house outside the gates of Freudenstadh is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1, next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with closure of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then-called company company mbH, on April 13, 2014, some 30 000 nights "stay lost annually and proceeds through the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in the fall of 2014, the numbers of refugees from refugees that entered the district, offered the landlord as a fellow accommodation, offered for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the establishment of a construction plan to secure the territory as a hotel site.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not disputed in the council at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadts, Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and said already at the time of serious interested visitors at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group LuisenhHotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer in Bad Bergzabians had acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us special negotiator sets the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair US President Donald Trump, Special Representative Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury in a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel has recorded the work in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote on appeal to his own individuals.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper identifies the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there is already first demonstration of the body in connection with a meeting between Trumps, oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies accuse Kremlin since longer, targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between trumps election campaign and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">There are several men in the focus of investigations into the campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took more and more trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonderkommando Trump personally moved into the center and investigate the accusation, whether the president in the wake of the affair may disabled the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine and decide evidence in possible interruptions and to decide whether the charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called anchor chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on if there are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">In addition, the panel can also be switched off from the Public Prosecutor to charge persons under the oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the stations CNN, preliminary charges have already been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trumps Consultant and Knapersson Jared Kushner as well as his former election campaign Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that evidence shows that Mueller should not intimidate in his work and that he should be necessary quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not be called, that the Grand Jury will be turned on by the end to decide about the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the enforcement of the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Trump is a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President of Thursday evening was used to present a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about them. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing from the enforcement of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also work normally in obedience, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House fortifies all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent at "faire" ways.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI leader James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">We have no reason to assume that something has changed in it, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey was fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this Rausroot, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wants to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump did ask him to create an investigation against the former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president stands under large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Representative and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That dissolved speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to put away.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an Independent Special Representative of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair, Richard Nixon took a position later, in which he could be fired on urging of the President of Justice in theory.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and democratic senators were set out on Thursday, after which the special negotiator could not be released so easy.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic Eisberg is driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Arctic the gigantic iceberg has loosened from the scarcity of barely seven times of Berlin's scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometer large Koloss toss now to the north and will probably take two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the biggest ironmonants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people doesn't go out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">As a result, climate change has played a role in the demolition of the ice cream, is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">For some 30 years, it has been a show of unusual merging of ice ploughs in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken column has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeira.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floating on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow closer to the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeira is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this shelfeises the equilibrium of waxing was disturbed and disrupting some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scarce may fall there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many things to say that the Larsen-C Schelfeira is in danger, for the front edge have never withdrawn itself as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron table stand under tension and could fall, if there is a piece of keys at a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and pushes the ice as much water as it yields the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the shear said that the glaciers can reach the sea directly into the sea, and much quicker than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in small dimensions, the British research project for observing the Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is after AWI-data with nearly 50 000 square kilometers the fourth largest shadow of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the open ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural standing and no direct connection to climate change is conscious, the ice plate is now entering a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most broadest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is controversial, whether the Larsen-C Schelfeira will return again and may merge together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development would take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to change climate change, so in the past decades, many kingfisher of the Antarctic peninsula are crammed.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirts of the Antarctica extends South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the polar surface of the Antarctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase was contributed to decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the past 50 years the Antarctic Peninsula have warmed around three degrees and count towards the areas where the temperature is fastest growing.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy hardening the sound of NGO Migrants Resourism</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has NGOs working the life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they may not continue to continue, if they do not hold new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if you do not write a new code of code, it is difficult to see how they can work," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning was a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rained' because their crew had been effective effectively with traffickers in a fashion that lightened the illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The aid organisation, which has only been in operation since one year, refused to express itself in extensive resolutions of the Italian national Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we can't operate in search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organisation in a opinion on social media.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can judge all accusations that are currently collected, only assess that we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had the boat of 'Youth Rained', the Iuventa, had been supervised since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew members are delivered on board, which can be supplied directly from traffickers, and that smugglers can be used again, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place, only 1.3 miles prior to the Libyan coast, according to the abstract of the national radio, whose content of Italian media was published.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian coast, rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not out of any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct boats, boats like Iuventa must have taken on board a Italian police officers who monitored their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been explained to the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessarily, but acceptable, as they would not bring any "essential changes or disabilities" to their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization doctors without borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who came to Italy have declined sharply in the past few weeks, causing the efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with the local citizen of fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnels," said the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1596">He gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali via measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilmer Biker, the "Berlin's outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region to enjoy four days of Trials and sights.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">It followed lookout points, partly on towers, of which one could look far beyond the farmed forest and the pre-bearing levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">There was always long ascents for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the People's Festival.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, view point to the lookout spot, connected through "flowige" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga conducts for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of shooting through wind and weather across the stadium?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long been a serious industry to become a lucrative business - great stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high places.</seg>
<seg id="1615">That's also known the first Bundesligaverns that are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The VfL Wolfsburg made early in 2015, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire a brand new young target groups for the VfB," says the Executive Board of Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">He is sure, "that on this move, some clubs still rise."</seg>
<seg id="1619">The FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven are qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt saw great potential in the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen have now established a agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real soccer ball has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people are still going into the stadium," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be present far more often in these markets, than just once a year to send the Federal ligaments to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-Sport computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," Counterstrike "or the FIFA-Simulation FIFA at competitive plane are fostered.</seg>

<seg id="1629">And in the Asia play, e-sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a correct sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is safe in need.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froby is also involved with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports- School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he's competent and many biological and physical reactions prove to be found in classical sports - such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also need cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response ability.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only work on console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">Froby but also problems: "doping is becoming increasingly a theme."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of the classic sports.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists have positive impact the high-inclusive effect of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are international on the way, this is like a great global family, there is no intercultural inhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of corporate consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software (BIU) says the E-sport a rapid growth predict.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016 there have been 50 million euros in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages their friend through texts and calls for suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been suspended on parole.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was condemned in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is incomplete.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy was lurred at a mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">In red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and down to the bottom, when she was condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have Conrad Roy," said the lawyer's lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"she finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has not accepted any responsibility, "said she.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance that they are completely unfortunate."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that their "age or maturity, or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A public prosecutor read a declaration by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, who said that there was "no day, in whom I do not have the loss of my beloved son.</seg>
<seg id="1677">I want that he is proud of me and how I am with everything I try. I try, despite all my pain that we will carry out for eternity, for his sisters, "says it in it.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Roys Sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she will never be persecuted by the realization that she would never be part of her brother's wedding or his aunt for his children.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"not to have this only person with whom I was together since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep to me for the rest of my life," she said.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a real precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime, committed suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>

<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press of the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1700">Kimmich confirmed: "this is what you want to take as a player: responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old worked as mini-lame on the field.</seg>
<seg id="1702">On the right behind, this is his position, the white Binde on the arm did its rest.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And at all, Kimmich worked in this startup such as the one who can take the ruder also best in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions, tried to direct the uninstalled troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had a look at all, while many others were busy themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Vidal to play his missing fitness (folks hardly); Renato Sanches come up on the devil (folks only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle come on to fall in their first appearance at the Bavaria-Trikot.</seg>
<seg id="1707">That all still folks good.</seg>
<seg id="1708">Süle ran beside Kimmich, Rudy before the defense of the defense, both retired.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The well-known Napoli storm was very difficult, moreover, Süle also tried a few times in the play-up.</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy gave that the result was "not so, as we have hoped for us."</seg>

<seg id="1715">Kimmich retired after a few crisp statements on his back of his new players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">There he heard of Süle an interesting proposition: "what happens here, I have already noticed.</seg>

<seg id="1753">Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the companies as a call.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly funded the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines apply as carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automotive manufacturers, to install the neutralisation of diesel vehicles from diesel vehicles, take also what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the Agrarian Research Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective, because the plant was subjected to climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacterial, the Zwergzikades, and with very dry weather, there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil does not only feel for vacationers, it is also asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">To the solutions that are being considered, a better water distribution and slowing of evaporation from the ground, but also the sprawishing plants with a shake mixture of sound and water, and the development of varieties that are resistant to drought resistant.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Rioce meet on Wednesdays in order to check their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state Sinaloa, organised by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and inaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was informed that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack on grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have three words written on a plaque at the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask reporters, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug addictive, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and during the whole country the corpses are frequent, more journalists are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589, after attacks and threats, there were at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their publishers and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and his journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply routed, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger at the Rioce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamanian.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Even though 2010, a special edition of the Federal Prosecutor was built in order to edit the cases of journalists, according to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked every year with drug dealers and organisational crimes, the murderers are only rarely placed before the court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they are still able to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, and although the terrain is still more constricter.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killer, no justice, the meeting on security of security is little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why, we suspect all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the newspaper Rioce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was shot out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which was translated with "12th River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The archers drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing to silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in January and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of enchanting, two-story Mausoleum for drug addictions that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget it for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, the publication of an interview with the Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartons in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release does not hesitate to offend the children, the band members bought every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country on its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues knew that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was working as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined the establishment of Rioce and sold 50 US dollars involved in the establishment of Rioce.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without the noise of the poison problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard tread studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors" Cabot Price "for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for protecting journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where they always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug dealers in Sinaloa, "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you need to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do with so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Rioce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird that could curse the boyfriend, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love to be a routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask her own assumptions to question how they can do the best and stay alive in the life.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their very clean shops, their secret start and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censored and self-maintaining.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinties.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa, not just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugging, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff met by Rioce to security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days earlier, yware that was sold exclusively to governments, to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside the heat, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-storey building in a central class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the kidding, some of the reporters, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who described the governor himself as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug tanks must be under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Rioce has clicked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state spending, focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted, or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write, what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (pri), which remained almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Several pri governors were accused of corruption because of high-strength corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including a son of "El Chapo" Guzman a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers had considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers who protested against the killings of journalists, because the staff has become something that they could never expect: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez carded a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration due to a further journalist at the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western federal state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists became stronger, as they have written in organized protests "SOS Press" on walking distance and building sites.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tried to gather international support for Justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuses the authorities to express journalists and bring them to the truth because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that it is divided from the government, because she is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organisational crimes, involved in government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug candidates, but also on the order of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">In the past year, the media group "Articulo 19" contributed more than half of the attacks on journalists of police officers and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the killings have a horrifying effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgot the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern boundary of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones lay down beside its separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close how the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do what El manana von Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly set up the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and looking for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue working, it is a daily dance with risk-rich decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, gives the drug trafficking him scarcely.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Rioce sat on the pavement before the office and drank beer, when all their telephones began to sums.</seg>
<seg id="1913">19 confirmed the dead in a series of shooting-in and security forces near the town of Mazatlan, 19 confirmed the dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the board of boarding, they released news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers to watch the guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Under the massive portrait of the folded founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces.</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioners asked me about sending them to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soften his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, though a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhinorns of a Canadian miners were so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even find out that his soiled skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a "unpeaceful past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the embroidered dinosaurs that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurs, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-lasting condition has researcher who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the Panamanian vegetable fressers is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rocks at the place, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil was discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you have blinking only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens - Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this vegetable fresser, although it is covered with armour and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The very strong dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a parachuting technique, which is known as counterattitudes, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix well in its surroundings and to soften his enemies, experts say that it suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurs family made the headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one by a team that has spent over 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shed and armaments on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shady, a widespread defence method in the animal, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the console is customary, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressure by flesh fressful dinosaurs that the evolution of the confrontation was favoured by the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter shady - do think about deer, zebras or girds - are much smaller and injurious than prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators must have been the chalk-time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales shows that the skin of the dinosaurs bay was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on information about his life, including his constant loan, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died in a river and cast out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was so warm like South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with tapered skin, but also in three dimensions and the original form of animal keeping it," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early crayon period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need plenty of imagination to reconstruct it. if you are only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, passed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex lived, millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of its furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings in the journal of Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea, and was fumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips spread out of his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant hereaters was pushed by the western Canada, until a flooded river it was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater exploration of the dinosaurs kept his armor in exquisite detail detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are so well received, that the hood still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is so rare as a gain in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Cloaked remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that bear the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers moved upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole '.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, kilometerlengthy - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), around 20 people were injured on the highway Stuttgart-Munich (A8).</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police against 17.00, the police stations were nozhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, in a row.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no information about the exact number of the injured parties.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It took some mild to moderate injuries, the police officer said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great deal of ambulances was on the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, a round of ten kilometres was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ reporter, it also came to massive Disabilities - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle enker, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 o'clock the second accident took place on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue wrench was on the way to the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tested "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or it is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: bufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the sheer and wakes an unsel, or breaks the gast in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn testet currently the seamless ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One is confirmed on the mobile phone that the ticket is taken, so it evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"comes the offer, wide we expect it.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It is expected to be available to many other remote locations in Germany at the beginning of next year, "said a railway speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the railway of the ticket rankings without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use the use, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have booked an online ticket - what are already most of the passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased via the train App, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of the ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort Check-in" works: one goes up in the train, calling his ticket under "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers, a button for electronic evaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train conductors get a message on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is on the train and taken the booked seating level Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train attendant at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already entourable online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep going on, keep silence.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the railway - which in turn is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"who wants to relax without ticket checking through our train personnel, check out in the DB navigator itself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management of DB FernTraffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to enter into the individual customer requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel, knows that in addition to delay and missed trains the ticket controls are one of the biggest sleeve.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which rented and scroll through Facebook to their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled across a post by somebody from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still on the road," said it there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused when nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ theePharoah was constantly prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of Browns lepale body that was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," she thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was not new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone, to tweets you on the evening to Tweet on people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police officers and people who cried out, and by a man who claimed to be the father's father, who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">You watched a live feed at which a policeman stand before a group of protesters with a bellman dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, another policeman will be his rifle and cried: "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell recalled their testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder we have used to call ourselves and which we can call it typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two will drive to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, the strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell ran with her daughter who had a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two a conversation she had countless times in this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2045">I could not take her away, "Ferrell said later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You must know it and see it up and tucked up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It has to be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give her experience in which she personally experienced no eclatent racism, she is not unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel the feeling I would prove to have a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground towards a campground when activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepare bags before and helped to pass on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to accept Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally" after the 9th of August, "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health qualities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later he met Ferrell during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only "document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question occurred Ferrell in the meaning: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently declared in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around the death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment was closer to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are depicted, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on ferrelling experience - to demonstrate that it is dealing with the movement "not a Messiah leader, but around a community," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, "Whose Streets's documents show" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of ferrelates life as she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be a certain level of injuries at this work and the exploitation of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is the role of black gay women in the wider Black-lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement that followed the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identified the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling with different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women need to bear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement really is held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not a affirmical type of action," when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's not a coincidence even though it was on front of the front, because in a life of these cruises as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson has long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police have continued.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social environment of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet they mourned to a singing and she feels committed to this memorial, since she left for three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the Süver of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one at the bit gallery said: "it would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That was real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "doesn't need any person" (Siggi Banners) or simply: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates are building that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which the other shops benefit, fear the enemies, that then the pedestrian zone are bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned precisely on the premises, at which the farm market stands, in the 13 direct marketing their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be concluded with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery movers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Beda place with the opportunity to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone room: "we've been buying almost weekly in the farmer market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady always liked very much.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and above all, after construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There is also that in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This is likely to be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the purpose of the shopping cart in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, dross or supermarkets: I think it is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shop stores are empty here - some of them for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms, because the people are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special businessman is almost no longer and what is remaining, will then disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasantry market during the building time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even on duration when the bit gallery comes in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it have the penpenst bit gallery before, to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center, which is empty, does not need any one.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farm market hall, there are no place thanks to the insane market - as I think - senseless construction projects in Bitburg has no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmer market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - those attached to cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits have been created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks tubes and hair sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analytics did a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly made diplomatic messages over the site WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called a Becoming Resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their specialized competence in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transluous and leaving dissidy, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Manning and made up of the 30 portraits, as a bit intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many wise men can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly about the identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 acces, including six violations of the espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison its picture was suppressed so much that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in the Manning is deliberately sitting on a driver seat and a platinblonde perig is associated with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project "Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strange artifacts such as cigarette stummel and chewing gum by removing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," declared Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were made to unequal bribe, which interviewed several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "suppressed images," who would be predict a future in which the President of Cheltense would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was a few days after the book has been published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happily collars.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a little while at the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the governmental camp and against transgender forces to handle new, tweetting paths which he should actually fix, further flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey Hagborg was asked after a strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen at a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a written artistic statement on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for their superscript among them (the "i" in their family name is an end of the "automatic concession" whose foundation is gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thoughtful of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what humans will hopefully bring to what our genome is not concerned, who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is one page from the above mentioned comic-Novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it appears in the hand of the disciplines of the United States of the United States as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put in cold words, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"it is never the mouth."</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room from the masks, of their own genomic simulakras, which converts themselves as hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), which were written with their genetic apologations with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," says Dewey-Hagborg, from the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is in progress for a Professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who had been sought as suspects, after a man had been discovered in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acts of the National Court of Cook County.</seg>

<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority in Chicago that the bodies had been discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared on the site of the event for dead, and detective the stitches as murder, while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007 Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathema is now in ururgy and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter, which is examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates at this investigation," said Cubbage.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and wanting to himself.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he needs the suspect oppressive to pursue the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police has an idea of their stay, and our efforts to localise them," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said that the police got a phone call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building which has just received an enigmatic tip, the said that in apartment 1008 was something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident happened on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathema and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victims had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents: "the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and researched a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice-President Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian vice-remier Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti-doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain state of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK anti-doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard, "Mutko declared on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the code that describes the criteria for relaunch of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything regarding Russia's cause.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria specified in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-Doping authorities approved the reported investigation by the WADA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in a alleged state sponsored dopings in the Russian sport.</seg>
<seg id="2189">In terms of the matter, Mutko said: "we lead the investigation by because our anti-doping system has inserted a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something which does not exist. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales station Rsport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave problems the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report lists controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Nobody has to accept this report unconditionally, "Smirnov added.</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded as part of the doping scandals from the WADA carrying out doping control in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">It has been allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA-General of Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moved into the right direction to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised Anonymity, some workers did not mourn.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is at Wachsen to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it allows companies to carry polls, specifying groups and demographic groups to deal with professional groups and demographic groups, and in some cases Whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives to apply directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she has a better view into what your employees think and feel at Glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap-polls and polls of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows most complaints and which executives have low access results - so that you can drill up, why.</seg>

<seg id="2222">And if the main leader is included, complaints related to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is badly treated or unethical, it may experience costly consequences by consumers-boycott, workers-fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, converting to more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their company headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report an issue, he had to submit a phone number or e-mail to the company's headquarters, a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said it was not a good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Well, since the company Convercent is able to find problems, who were sitting in offices in cities or countries, have been hidden - such as discrimination, harassment or insolder practitioners - are identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in employment dispute."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen has collapsed due to ethical violations through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "Social Media" came to their right, "that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty washing online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as service, and animate the company with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors, which have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the whole capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought up his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex on research that shows that today's employees expect more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated to give your time a business with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be able to feel in a company, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel stronger to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience, which uses both Convercent as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors gain Rendites when their portfolio businesses are well run. companies running well when employees are ready and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools promise third promise, commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement is important after the experts of the workplace culture.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless when the administrator of a company will not take measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks for your feedback after your feedback, it may anticipate that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this disappointments and employees can deactivate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kotter International, the company has seen, which have left too much for collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"for if you don't follow employees," Habt you really belong to me? "</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who passes monthly employee surveys now, was able to guide measures on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, then Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting from the feedback of frustrated employees, it was able to organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training within the company to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Ruby Tuesday will always get new insights into the staff, and it hopes for a long run that leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is well-known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose man, you lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose company.</seg>
<seg id="2259">The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins</seg>
<seg id="2260">It is at 23: 00, when a lot of UCLA Footballplayers are talking on one side of the new practice fields on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have moved out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these unlimited minutes are a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are registered to the summer courses are returning after the three hour exercise, before they return on the next morning at 6: 30 am to the Waterman Football Center.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is for the guys the next three days a real tretmill," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora before Monday was Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and she has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA at 19: 15 will begin to meet the players already fully-packed time.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the breaking ceremony moved nearly a week after the last season and during the summer school during Moras six times during Moras, six times are held at Westwood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August 18. 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Mora said he supports the change of NCAA support, even if they have to add a further point of time to multiple times.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous load three or four days on it, and it is very challenging," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they simply have pressed them, they gather themselves together, they are great people.</seg>
<seg id="2272">I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great. "</seg>
<seg id="2273">The UCLA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished, which has been thrown out of the clear sieving of its fields from a adjacent parking place and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class that has already been caught with footballs, which will be no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," Mora said.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people can rent there a room and then set aside to record a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2277">If you have the video from an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.</seg>
<seg id="2278">But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.</seg>
<seg id="2279">We will do the best, with what we have.</seg>
<seg id="2280">I'm not too much worried about this.</seg>
<seg id="2281">We have a plan. "</seg>
<seg id="2282">Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterfeit messages</seg>
<seg id="2283">Facebook wants to send more potential articles with miscellaneous mailing lists from third parties and whose results are shown below the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. it is one of his efforts to fight the called Fake news.</seg>
<seg id="2284">The company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible counterfeit messages, which may show results of the results test from the original article.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake News, of which many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2286">The problem has become a big political topic in Europe, where the French electors were flooded with false stories, and Germany will support a plan to be punished by the social media networks, if they do not succeed, hassertive Postings, as before the elections there in September, quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2287">On Thursday, Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that, in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany, a test of new facts review will be launched.</seg>
<seg id="2288">"in addition to the knowledge that stories of factions skipped third parties, people want more context to make more profound decisions on what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.</seg>
<seg id="2289">She added that Facebook will continue to be able to test his feature "in conjunction with the article" and in other amendments to its news feed, to decrease false news.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze-music video and was an slip hole for Margaret Thatcher in 1970 and 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in Kent River Valley in Kent, and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a thermophaarigen Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of somebody who has been dead for 300 years," he said. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that illustrated in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briy May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the Daumenabprint on the side of a letter which was written by a double-man in the 1700-s, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his Daumenabdruck!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell to smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself would be.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") seems to be nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore Victorian "new" castle, to study the archives and had spent many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the moned hyena buttons on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of ancient castle, and spoke with landscans, gardening, and sometimes with the artists that worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only granted the full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes hit a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, wirf it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps, who represent what had said: "one could mean that landing flickers would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let all go down! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to take a wider base in the English history, among them 'The Labourer', who leaves a man who is rebuilt the newly built castle to close to the peasantry of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which occurred 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasantry began in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are connected together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', telling the story of the Jesuit paters, which the family Darrell lived seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The smugglers' in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell appeared from the 18th century, filled his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery that was first dug later when his Sarg was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be right Gauner to make money and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell's males deletes their debt crisis by giving rich old women married - I present them as a heap well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise longing. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his approach in the castle, Rhodes went to search of other unique narrative experience</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wild for a comic-novel about Elämänmäki behind it, the grounds of a sanatorium dating back to the early 20th century, which has since been demanded by nature.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney has a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go back," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Oh, now I have to get ready with the damned life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign launched: over 300 years old Mariehelle covered in Rhöndorf.</seg>
<seg id="2324">With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Mariehelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign to launch a new roof mark on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Until Thursday, Mayor Otto NEUHOFF will want to keep the logo and the slogan of Nelson Artz.</seg>
<seg id="2326">At the end of August, it will be the culmination of the campaign on the island of Grafenwerth.</seg>
<seg id="2327">"to be nice for us.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Or?, "ask the makers of action since yesterday at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"we think of this (of course!) not really," write it on her yesterday unlocked website.</seg>
<seg id="2330">"but we use this measure to win your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And to make clear that manches is better than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In essence, we are the firm conviction that we know as Bad Honnefer citizens to know the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well. "</seg>
<seg id="2333">In the promotion, it is going to pass by more than "only" a logo and a slogan says it continues.</seg>
<seg id="2334">"it is true to formulate a generalized promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature."</seg>
<seg id="2335">Finally, she stand in the competition with other municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2336">A medium-digit amount allows the town of Bad Honnef to cost her new roof brand and the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2337">Military forces in Turkey - Earth's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year, at the beginning of August at Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (Yas) was advisable over pension funds and carriage in the Offizierskorps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff, as previously, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the government, the five vice-president and the Minister of Defence, Home, Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the meetings.</seg>
<seg id="2344">So the civilians were in the Yas in the overnumber.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government moves the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Deputy Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office but the Commanure of the Heeres, the Air Force and the Navy were buried.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed Coup, head of Chief Erdogan 169 of 326 Generals and Admirals failed.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan as a wire taut.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people, who have been involved in the coup attempt immediately, is negotiated for Ankara following this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow of the "religious gift," he gave him the opportunity to complete the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But Erdogan is really in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "uneasiness" in the military headquarters. "</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns of concerns about an increasing "Islamism" of the army which manifests among others in the abolition of the head ban for soldaters, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">At least, the big purification at the army and security forces goes further.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan sent other 7395 public officials, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed, when Erdogan was tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they drawn up on appeal to their role as a guard of the worldly state rules.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan urged the power of the military step by step, not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is targeted targeted by the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a nament officer, who, after the coup attempt of fear of persecution, sought for asylum, the Turkish army will be in a few years "full of extremists and salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this does not meet such development, NATO could not allow Nato.</seg>
<seg id="2363">In the Alliance, there is a doubt in the Alliance for the superiority of the Turkish army.</seg>
<seg id="2364">The leadership structures and operations of operations are "weakened," tell Nato diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="2365">Washington changes rules for Green Card</seg>

<seg id="2379">From that sum up the country take 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on whose foundation the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country, will definitely be coordinated, Sühl explained.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Destruingen train as an operator are already included in the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"thus, the roadmap, the used vehicles and quality standards are traded," said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the Ministry and Rail Company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Thus the race shuttle should be ordered in December 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascent of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that in 2017 it can't even be crazy, a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern swarms have developed from their inflatable partners in robots with a silicone skin, which feels warm - with consciously human reactions, which are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robots to its beliefs "and select everything, from the eye-color of the robot through the form of breast warts up to type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there is still lack of rest, as many robots have the "personalities" who would look out a stepford wife.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern swarms have developed to robotic with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they'll be appealing, such as relapterness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the true Roxxy Gold Sex robot with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" with the impression of relentourism and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that has been adapted to your personality as well as possible," weakened the site of true Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So do you like what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its mood in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired of being fixed at conversation or can be "in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many incipious aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they have real human relationships - but the undertakings of female relationships, when you go one step to Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah is intranquil one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True to his website true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxy?" says it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these Sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sexual toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement indicate something dark and Tieferes in our culture, to an withdrawal of the ideal of equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjugation as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men are naturally not having sex robots, and while the FRR notices its increasing popularity, they still remain in the verge of consumption culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is leakages out of the boundary, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, be very teaching.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not weird or beleidily, until the free market gives permission to this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain extent that these highly developed sex robots are immersed in a period in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, who has mastered women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphical pictures, the swallowed body and the stretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to represent a physical similarity to actual women so realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder want that they feel deserted that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point, when it comes to their "personalities" the robots have no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can't separate himself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">You have no placement or background history, nothing that suggests about independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Expressed differently: you are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the form of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human beings</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a Binder-eit of the Trump-era that the political circuits that have polarized the US voters to split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Ernteddy, there were newspapers in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump selectable relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly told to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices has been the power of Trumps, to accommodate families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-lawed poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that the unit can have a powerful effect against an enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House everyone knows whom it knows, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to protect the dining table, it is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and dump, we refer to the grassy possibility that his mb will no longer be removed from one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a frightening long-time scenario, in which Trump republicans of the right wing "normalizes," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a epitome of reason.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I think I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's official version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement saw) - both in fact occur in a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of the New York park department, and the top three dollars that one can spend in the city, if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crurry and the animals turn to look full of anxiety about their own shoulders - most gloomy and the klimpering music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines are familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage, the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karousel is still a strange magical experience since there are two two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pull out my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to reduce the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what a neutral exchange should be, but also put pressure on the server to bring persona personality in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store excuse excuse, while I tired the experience, you can submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to the hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius abandoned the prison for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of beholding in the hospital, which he suffered the prison authorities, according to a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence because of murder of prosecuting attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of July 2013, while he shot them several times by a door of the toilet cabin at his home in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder, hidden in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecuting attorneys have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say is to be sighted.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Code concluded that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is a danger that his sentence increases to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberger schools, the quadranugler from Fützen and Epfenhofen were dismissed in the holidays and to the continued schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the students are going to move into high school, four at the reschool.</seg>
<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening, Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Biesental headquarters in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The 29 students representing Sophia Schumacher and Regine Medes chose a young eagles which grows in the chicken, but then released in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">In addition, the mlower Schar brought a musical with the title "The Eagle in the chicken."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it from his chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a poultry guy, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken struck, and the eagles spread out on a high mountain its wings, and escaped.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, the classes were three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockles, the cylinder contributed to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stand up for integration, school director Angelika Sitte said.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young lady is different than the other young (chicks), but belong to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">He will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His purpose is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">They wish every fourth-watery that he feels in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">It followed thanx to the colleagues, the former school manager Michael Mueller, who always enters into pedagogical cases, and the parliaments.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The kitchen-time has now passed, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.</seg>
<seg id="2477">They leave their students after two years of teaching only very, because it was a really great time.</seg>
<seg id="2478">Finally, they can rely on the fourth-watery.</seg>
<seg id="2479">To be completed, all students were able to sound a song of summer time and holiday.</seg>
<seg id="2480">This broke great joy in the children.</seg>

<seg id="2484">On the morning of 1 August, Sithonia was arrested by a group of illegal people, among them the two Bulgarians.</seg>
<seg id="2485">They were released on the same day, while there is an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported BTV that Bulgarians were released later.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have control the control of the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay at a place that is not intended for this purpose, which is not intended for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2488">Inspections will continue throughout the season.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel vehicles: what people need to know now</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">In the diesel summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group software updates have offered a total of around 5.3 million cars.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are to improve the emission of emissions of emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-Diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanine of the ACE car Club Europe gives ratings:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action obligatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the traded software updates are optional.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that tell Schumann software," says Anja Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Their retrofitting has arranged the Bundesamt Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers announced a fast implementation in the coming months, but not yet called any exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed you to write to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If anyway, it is due to inspect a inspection, this will be done in their frame.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long will the changes in total?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," Smetanine says.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The hangings of the manufacturer's commitment and political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"because we have seen, voluntarily negotiate the car manufacturers at the subject of environment so far."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">It could be time consuming to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do, who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW-Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE advises to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably foreign manufacturers would follow, so Smetanine.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is there a massive prize of Euro-4 cars now?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE fears that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions where bicycles are threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural areas there is no value losses for older diesel.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The ACE advises to wait for sale yet.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award</seg>
<seg id="2522">The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2523">The first awards ceremony at President Trump promises to become politically.</seg>
<seg id="2524">One of the winners will not come - from protest.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Ll Cool J (49) gets the first rapper one of the prestigious awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), and the choreographers Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) were also known as well.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally, US President Donald Trump is organizing a reception together with his wife Melania on the award.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The Lear Foundation announced the progressive TV series, thus already announced to abandon participation in the gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">The "New York Times" said: "this presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - they even neglected them - and that's burdened me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized, she will use the conversation with Trump to clear their visibility.</seg>
<seg id="2532">According to the former President John F. Kennedy, Kennedy-Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Among previous premieres are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.</seg>
<seg id="2534">We make the city busy</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes back to Rente in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Since 31 years, Wacker city master has been building master.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun, as he conveys the press briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for its successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, I wonder that so far, no application makes the requirements profile so far.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for the next possible time an architect or building engineer.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus, under the contempt of regular retirement periods - still enough time for a work.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was assigned to the administrative community as a sub-law authority, the applicant must refer accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city definitely.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If she would not fill them anymore, citizens would have to go to the guidance up to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But Bürgernähe is the city and himself important, says Wacker who reports from a good plant climate and good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Over 30 years in office, some major projects have accumulated, looking back on the stapler with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we are making the city busy," he is sure about the building office and his staff safe.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects stand on the agenda: the reshaping of the former Hukla Areas and the rainfall-parking lot are attached.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The kines bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium is still subject.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will strike some 1.5 million euros with beech, "if we make it right," estimates Wacker.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The job here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Be noblemish for a city master's master room.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs own building yard and gardeners can be reacted very flexibly.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," so Wacker, and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye to do it," when new buildings are approved, the separating city master emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The city master's high responsibility contributes to the city master.</seg>
<seg id="2559">It is a building, "at the end everything runs here on my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">In care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in existence for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been around for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "we are looking for someone who really identified himself with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">For continuity is not only important to a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you want to bury Roland Wacker, after information about the town of Haslach, he should have a degree in engineer or Bachelor with technical direction architecture and have good specialized knowledge in the areas of building up and building planning.</seg>
<seg id="2564">Building and civil engineering, construction planning, construction planning, underlining planning, urban property management, municipal estate with construction yard and city husbandages as well as sub-law administration including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Thrown on bike: South route closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike on the track of the Leaks road (B116) on the lines previously unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so severely damaged, that the herent freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators walk from two male activity and search for the night hours after them.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Close to the Tatort, a pink roller and bike drivers were watched by witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"that goes far beyond a Lausitz region," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch said to the APA.</seg>
<seg id="2571">The or the perpetrators brought himself in large danger and also endangered the train.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage at the Lok and the late-minute drive and the cost of transport vehicles, Pönals could also be allocated to the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2573">For a total of a "considerable" sum, the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damages were fixed on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south route could be managed without disability.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Almost ten persons were out of Friday morning, two of them looked at the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall, however, they were delayed.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, some 200 meters had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Isolators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meats, dairy products and chocolate may help IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound as a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products could linking the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The inable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causes stomach cramps and blends, recurring or bloody attacks, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected will usually come, meat and dairy products, researchers at the Washington University found that researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins to develop immune cells develop a tolerant intestinal.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immunodeficiency cells in the intestines are to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide themselves in food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are imable to destroy inflammation, are balanced out of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is inclined towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance transported immunodeficiency occur in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbial, and development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more they had more than these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan-rich nutrition is tolerant, less flammable intestinal milieus, if the same system can work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, sought out a kind of immune cell that had found tolerance as it had found that a group of study powers had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which was separated from separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She thought that the difference with the intestinal microbioms of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced DNA sequenced, and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were tucked up in a sterilous environment so that they lacked a gut microbious and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacterias spread on the immune system, the researchers investigated L. reuteri in a liquid and then brought small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be a side product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when Tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, as these cells can control inflammation on the surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic</seg>
<seg id="2605">At Manchester United has signed a "Genie" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes that the midfielder had his debut at Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The Chelsea's 40 million pounds subtitle from Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid begins, and impressive in the holder roll, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asia tour in the blues and managed to improve the Mourinho that he had to improve in front of the Premier League season before the start of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him sooner than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku joined the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho to start-XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The independent revealed in this week that Mourinho wanted to wish three more new releases, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job," three of its four primary new mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="2612">"three of four to receive, thank you for the club," he added.</seg>
<seg id="2613">"I will be happier if they get four of four, but they gave themselves great effort."</seg>
<seg id="2614">Boeing "painted" Dreamliner in the sky</seg>
<seg id="2615">The US-aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliners in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilot flops from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in Michigan, and moved into the form of a Dreamliners over the USA, which are several thousand kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The form of a Dreamliners was to be the form of a Dreamliners.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The whole thing was a test test for new engines.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Boeing had previously made such advertising before.</seg>
<seg id="2621">So the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2622">New surcharge for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind revolves around yet: when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD boss, the President of the Prime Minister, and Prime Minister, ever met with a certain concern to Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only no storyfires from the party headquarters, merely no headwind from the Federation - as loud as the most important wish of the election fighting.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz introduces the party, it has changed fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the employees are watching the Willy-Brandt-Haus with vigilting the events in the SPD ruling capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described with counterwind in the approach.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were deep suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after another.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and green.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red-green is easy to rule," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising factorsion of a Green Party has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a severe crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the country-election, his red-green coalition lost their one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Michael Winner's Green Party leader, Michael Winner, urged to return to his mandate to withdraw their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU represents a clear falsification of the voters.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Twest must immediately return their mandate, "said the Federal President and Election of the Greens Network of the Greens Network Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"it must not be true," he sighed a SPD electoral struggle, when the new hithersbotanity reached the party's party on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD-President of Lower Saxony, stands after the overcoming of the green chilies Elke Tlifefor CDU without his own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a large and small crises in the SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what next comes.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Miser started the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, relaxing the comrades of the time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">It was then, too - and it became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to swap the Düsseldorf-Pite, the party was smooth.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades have returned to the weeks later.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when she had turned out new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next break.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town was burnt.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he did so much wrong in the crisis communication, that's what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz fights for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the VW-exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board, the state-Saxon Prime Minister had already been in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese refractional values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or maybe exactly, because in the past few weeks, because in the past few weeks, they always tried to implement accents.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The funeral of the former Mayor of Hannover, from Hanover, to expand his power in Berlin, has not been hidden from Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him, as they spoke of Weil a stabilisation of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could enter.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In doing so, Weil hits no guilt in the party's party.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz wasn't at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">At times, comrades make the effort to keep its own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Your wrath is directed towards the green, and here, above all on the revolting parliamentarians in Tlifejackets.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratry, like Mrs. Tlifejackets her own careers with the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the Parteillofts in the SPD Parliamentary Council, the editorial network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Ms. TMidwest is not chosen because of its person as a direct candidature in parliament, but on the state list of the Lower Saxony's European Parliament, so the Anglo-Saxonian member states further.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence, it would be that she returns to her mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development on Wednesday in sensation.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler were once again given a review of the events so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been committed to sensation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the sanitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the surplus was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous sanzations are a "successful project" - it is finally important to promote interior development, and not only to create new areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On 4 April, I have received the information that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amount to 833 333 euros, of which would be 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the commune.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a renovation area then?</seg>
<seg id="2682">You will continue to investigate so indler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">But there is also a role, whether in the planned field should be interest in any interest.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territory limits could also move once again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The Steg competed on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellar presented the contents of the federal state-country program "Social City," in which frames were then carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are revitalisation of interior cities, improving the residential and workspace and expansion and expansion of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be specified, which means per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">Since January 1, 2017, the approved period of funding has been running until April 1, 2017, until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, however, only once the data will be carried out, in the context of those involved in the renovation area involved a questionnaire to fill in.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the submission order is expected to begin with the mezations in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then declared that every Commune had to carry out the disclaimer preliminary investigation.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about to evaluate and decide the municipal grievances, and to decide when will be rehabilitated and in which scope.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will be also a sanitation written in the plot also for the respective plot.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again, once again, and establish a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized, an essential success factor for the project is the participation of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Basic Law," where it comes to the structural condition and refurbishing views.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and housing," data can be made to size, distribution and residents of a residential area.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "Operation arc" is only to be replenished when building business rooms are operated.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, please note, Gotzel pointed out that a constant questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">Furthermore, newbuilding measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funding is made after the "Winddog principle" - who first comes, grinds first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">One could not be able to reserve funding for later "reservation."</seg>

<seg id="2714">The promotional cost of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event, which was up to US manufacturing during the last month, costs taxpayers according to the military that were left to the TIME magazine, up to 24.000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter designed in Connecticut was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House White House demanded the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the recordings of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopters arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning, and so long remained until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the hours a second team would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original aircraft had been during the event during the helicopter, while security personnel was on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the TIME, the records were not clear, whether ultimately, a second flight crew was required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal government to use government property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question that we created was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," the deputy commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">On the event, the President gave up a violation of the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to suspend government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are required to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But your use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Trump introduced an investigation in February in the background of his first campaign aircraft in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is enthralled by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers with American materials," said the vice-chair of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 concreations often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to continue the US president in the White House with precise Zentis.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 introduced 58 exercise landmarks in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The flight to the "Made in America" event attracted at the training needs of the air crew for the month, an official.</seg>
<seg id="2740">In addition, Helicopter Units flew 11 hours to this day for "non-presidential supporters."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers were the burden for any of the other props that were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved to issue the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 has no budget drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to Stundentarifen the US Ministry of Defense for the Financial Year 2017, the DoD replacement unit for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 USD per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the plane will list the flight time of flight over 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates is highly misleading," said Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs which are included in annual funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015 the equipment for DoD does not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time, the former press stud of the White House, Sean Spicer, defending the helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America," said Spicer.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent upon it.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have been working tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">It is, of course, appropriate to exiting. "</seg>
<seg id="2755">It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire-fire.</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House, Trump of Sikorsky spoke to the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspaghetti report abouts Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misconceptions of the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misleading scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissening, spokesman of the reform movement "We are church," stated after publication opposite the German Press Agency, he was waiting for the Bishop of Regensmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Benedict XVI of Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very important to see the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would have their deepest regret on their own underings or their then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican magazine "Osservatore Romano," by contrast, criticised that in the reporting on violence with "two" measure "measures.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In respect of the handles in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to be "shameful and shameful deeds," but the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and a member of the national Italian bioethics committee.</seg>

<seg id="2899">They are unfair, today's standards for past decades, because the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the misuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the memory band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>

<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese in Regensburg with the Enlightenment attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger domsparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with a high sensitivity "victims, 67 domestries sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was held in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be held that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially high Emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to many other defendants, many victims of the general crimes is estimated, and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories will unite with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann says, why the final report on the misfortune scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion was declared.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "incidents of violence against protected men at the Regensburger Domsparrow," is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a rise, many students draw out his "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">To the other, it appears as a cholecker and perfectionist, which was tangible for the oil when a Domspatz has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and reads all the 440 pages long from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is in existence at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he will be acquitted clearly by any suspicion of mid- or compassion with the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the nonviolence at the school took place outside of its active sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It can be noted that, in case of which, too late, or first accusations can not be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspouse grammar school, which he worked, was felt by practically all those questioned - "salvation," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger is an excellent witness, describes him as "warm", "sincere," "competent," and "understandable," the boys regularly supplies with cakes, cookies and bonbons, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which led to Wutausbreaks too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw up with chairs and threw the keys and put on the floor, but also earneying boys in hair or ears, he has already regretted, deeply regrets and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, in his honorary rescue, however, must be said that such corrective methods in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, widely distributed, with parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what is actually in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the nonviolence at the preschool, are the liberally excavators.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Since then, one wonders whether it has not more to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI, that many media has just thrown on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still jealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report concludes Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the report was reported very much about the subject of abuse during the bursburrows.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger premiered in the final report of any transaction or complicity in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: absolutely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never deceived me to speak with my father or my mother," said an eminent representative of the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they don't want to become parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorage, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in regard to the misfortune failures?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a more fragile student had formulated this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had timely evidence (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... also for really absurd to assume that it would be reckoned to him... rather obtrusive or clearer or rather opened, than in relation to their parents, internactors, confidence instructors etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report on the very clear result: "that in the run-up students and / or their environment, the study could not be confirmed as part of the study."</seg>
<seg id="2942">What concerns sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of every co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be accused of having brought him or brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to the contradictory crime, as in some cases unfortunately.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "nonviolence" to read at the bursburrows.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of having drawn "directions."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in coverage everything mixed and middled to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean separated: between the school and high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence, we say once again, other preferences.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the conductor of the Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases where boys were detected and malicized and malignited, all were at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skid states have to rule.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspouse grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It was, like most witnesses, the subject "Preschool" Tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was just happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was different at the Domspouse-Gymnasional grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there is no sawing violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims of the general humanity of R. estimates, and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at most, the accusation still remains.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish and from the predecessors at a school where he had not worked and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Worn by Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspouse gymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this, he insists that in the preschool the test was still practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the risk of negative press conferences, he recommended an urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test, was also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it took place in a legal gray zone, as everyone knows about us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It simply does not agree.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examination of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we're talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," i.e. the danger to assess the past moral action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the principality has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true, of course, not for sexual abuse, who was abhorred at all times, and not for what was broken up in the preschool of resistance and violence against children's children, that's already familiar with the back then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I'm glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplination and punishment, i.e., earns and ears to draw hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his rainy days, Georg Ratzinger has been reproduced in our conversations with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test also include the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, the Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only one side-roll.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, in no way, I didn't forget that he conducted an austere regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said once again: without these perfectionism, without which I call for unconditionated discipline, it would be hardly possible to form a institution of world-known regimens, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons, one can now make no big singer and stand before each success, right on which area, but always discipline, passion and self-windowment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger on the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that I've got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, foundations and heartfelt people, from which you can't imagine that he could do something to a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I will receive regularly, how many former Domsparrows are still working today, 23 years after his Emeritiation, regularly contact him, reading him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly about them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domsparrows are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also an adorable respectful man, to which they are still looking at today and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: everything one accuses to him are corrective methods which were at the time at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have already overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is very unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and yet another prominent brother, to make media-corn.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil purpose that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which has just been published, discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the rising areas would have acquired a 93-year-old man who would have acquired great merits and without the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps in Germany, no one would have to know the Regensburger Domsparrow, finally in peace.</seg>
