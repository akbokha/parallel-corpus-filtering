28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
the brother of the victim said that he could not be ashamed that he would hurt him , &quot; En@@ sure it went on with him . &quot;
the body located on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco to San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder , and investig@@ ators are ongoing .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , distributed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who worked as a cook in Boston before six months ago , his dream job as a chef in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter Restaurant in San Francisco .
a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter said that she sho@@ cked and sho@@ cked on the ground about his death . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; said the speaker further .
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this heavy time at Fran@@ ks Family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; the things went uphill for him . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment he had a girl@@ friend , &quot; shared Louis Garcia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine that he would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
his kind to connect to his family , it was always something to cook for us to prepare the dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of meditation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in all that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ riv@@ alled diamond that sh@@ ined every day , &quot; he said .
anyone who has the case on the case will be asked to call the name of the SF@@ PD at the number 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I always put in drawers .
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ miss@@ understand@@ able .
&quot; I will always put it in drawers , or get from the outside label , who with me and the reality usually have little to do . &quot;
&quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
at the best way , the actress ob@@ serves its time at home , pre @-@ TV with lo@@ cker@@ y D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .
for white gl@@ ut them bring the question after the children &apos;s desire : &quot; we must not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .

gol@@ fer Lang@@ er will receive the pyramid
his experiences on the horse are horri@@ ble .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er searched for some colleagues with a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 year old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyrami@@ ds &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes the horses remembered her holiday , they pursued her fast gal@@ lop home to the food .
one kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was no good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and that ended the riding career as well .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he led himself with his family on the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he did not hesitate to listen to photo .
this was the first time in Aachen and the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports relief was handed out to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala to the Golden Sport@@ pyrami@@ ds .
there is no lack of awards for sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Federal State Cross , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen inherited him already .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyrami@@ ds .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring .
and so he completed the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time winner of the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; was recorded on Saturday .
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ es@@ Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Rider of Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and Ab@@ th@@ um of Hand@@ s Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports events came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ate Society emigrated to the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er held distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential applicants , however , are at tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is based on a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the state of the economy - with taxes and regulatory systems .
Clinton wants to give the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
he himself would be completely different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
he will return regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax sets - for individuals and for companies .
Clinton , however , says : the state has certain duties to open , he has to open the dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the weal@@ thy would be increased , she says .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the theme of infrastructure .
it must be invested in that , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ ate .
the Democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so , there could be no party discussions on tr@@ ump .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and will return to the US coal extraction in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement wants to be announced .
in contrast , Clinton wants to expand its investment programme explicitly to expand the renewable energies and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only with infrastructure and international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , would both don &apos;t want to sign .
but at the same time both the U.S. don &apos;t want to is@@ olate themselves from international trade - just as just American jobs .
they should then be paid better , called Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars was a hunger strike .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must fall , then he says he might not be changed .
but the great discussion of the next months is probably likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to withdraw the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him , so that the budget deficit would only be larger .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least of the weal@@ thy wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every escape woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost in everyday life .
when arriving in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby , which is one year old .
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he looks curious in the room with great eyes .
his mother turns on the table top .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kissed the little ones .
the scene acts normally .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the division &apos;s leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are fle@@ dged .
they live in the Munich north , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized accommodations for all@@ ashed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made up the facility with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s help .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatening torture or death , or because their families send them as a hope of hope to Europe . &quot;
in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , for@@ cible , hon@@ orable , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
it continues to drive them .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; the tugs for example , for example , demand a sexual action for example , is no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that , as soon as they are in Germany , B@@ ahr tells us .
even here , women in refugees would often be regarded as min@@ der@@ ful and worse in refugee camps .
this also causes some 90 percent of women who live in the Munich Region , trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so familiar , that they say nothing .
&quot; or do not trust itself to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot;
since they often do not help to assist , there are more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven district governments are responsible for the refugees of refugees .
on the question of whether they are w@@ ishing from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and in the Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in accomod@@ ations of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separately accommod@@ ated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press writing of the government .
in the Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are apartments in some communal floors or houses only for women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
the committee &quot; rights of women and equality of the sexes &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be placed separately from men .
in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; l@@ acks privacy or are men and women together , it is possible to don@@ ate - for@@ cing violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and accessible to women easily , stands in the study .
how much the women feel of this protective needs , you can read the And@@ ur@@ b@@ room at the And@@ ur@@ b@@ ese House in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistance of assist@@ ants : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new workforce measures
deputy of the assist@@ ants have called their union with a new contract for their disp@@ utes in terms of a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour force from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it failed ministers to proceed to the concerns concerning the contract .
assist@@ ants and medical students have voted in July about the re@@ jection of a contract which was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government would have remained quiet , &quot; said that the treaty was rejected .
she said : &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and demands official new talks to all your concerns . &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today set a formal proposal on a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of escal@@ ating labour force that begins early September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in assistance to Assi@@ sts this year six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , following the election of the agreed contract conditions , were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the Treaty of physicians in England would be imported .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of external side@@ ers &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce his hands and an official end of the eight @-@ month war of the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ players in a gilded room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot destroy the impression that Ankara wants to be the prop@@ iti@@ ation of most .
there was the hand@@ some , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared narrow@@ ly and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for its rest@@ rained conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better .
the next day , a newspaper that Erd@@ ogan would have been so ben@@ evol@@ ent than would never happen to happen .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed to signi@@ fy the contrary .
but one of Putin , which showed that the government of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mention what he mentioned in his execution : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow from reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ an@@ nt .
he told Putin and accused Ankara to be back in the back .
the case was even greater , as it was celebrated by a missed boy@@ friend .
the Vet@@ r@@ ong is going to build up again , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted an enormous attack on Ankara .
once it seemed , the Turks would blame for everything .
on the serious , the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erd@@ og@@ ans would benefit from illegal oil trading in Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was awarded the President Erd@@ ogan to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is clear in the hand .
Erd@@ ogan needs all the friends who he can get after he was enth@@ ron@@ ed almost his am@@ tes coup during the last month .
he repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey too .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights , which usually takes several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be facil@@ itated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal attraction on the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television offered fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious toward the West , as it was a response to those who tried to over@@ take power as a weak answer .
to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll come across the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - which is weak@@ ened out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West .
in Ankara , Russian President won a bonus for ensuring that he demanded a coup d &apos;@@ etat after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ etat .
this is true for Moscow , a self @-@ compreh@@ ension that himself has a profound fear of regim@@ es .
the summit at this glorious palace allowed Russia and Turkey allowed it to represent an analy@@ st by an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of foreign visitors &quot; : two countries that embar@@ ked off from the West and to feel po@@ or@@ ly treated .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are always large differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages .
it could be noted that after almost three hours of first @-@ ch@@ ats , both pre@@ sidents at the press conference said that they did not even stri@@ ve the theme .
the president of Turkey r@@ ushed to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to refu@@ te this .
there is no unique con@@ sen@@ sus , where common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of fine host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey lost the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state may talk at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Staff , R@@ BS is to be reduced to a back@@ office .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan gave the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since then , when she had almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago .
in this time , &quot; R@@ BS &quot; brand features have been used to protect other final consumer brands .
she supported international sports with millions of pounds to Sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , head office and stock exchange rates are changing to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank &apos;s brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private clients who will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a visiting tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be part of our investment brand as well as the brand , under which our employees will be busy as we now become more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these trademarks .
R@@ BS has already told that his six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer run and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop at the bench of brands , as we are looking inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch this brand again , so I think that time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori arrives at Pre@@ di@@ lection its 3.@@ 000@@ th win in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings to him 3.@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit in New@@ market on Friday .
he set at Pre@@ di@@ lection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on its local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ channel winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won against G@@ ha@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened on New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ers when he cat@@ ches the victory .
two jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys reached a milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few before him have arrived .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intellec@@ t , which differs from the other in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thr@@ illed fans since years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie before several weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already picked up 6,000 gains if he would not only be a weekly and grand tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already been asking for almost 30 years of winners , which is great .
he has a living personality , what is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the sign of the British flat screen for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he survived a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago , he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six months of Sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doubts and to return to its top shape .
and he &apos;s not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier , that he wants to continue in competitions up to his minimum 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia &apos;s Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the narrow@@ est confidenti@@ ality of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in an opinion of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without stating reasons &quot; imp@@ aired Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his obligations as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been vice @-@ president since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he made his conclusion at the renowned Public Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is ( in Russian ) that he was later the principal officer and leader of the government .
he said to Putin on his appointment , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state , and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the narrow@@ est confi@@ dan@@ gling Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned on his own request .
but in spite of the ridic@@ ul@@ arity for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so , here is the sequence of a kind of power fight ?
nobody knows that .
but the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environment policy - pushed into big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are cited on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It &apos;s true that I &apos;ve asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - advert@@ ise posts four years .
as it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ ch@@ erh@@ ood ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , since a third term of Putin would have cast off the constitution .
but this post was taken from another , near ally Putin &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister , before he became President of three and a half years later .

Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be at the 75 fish around San@@ da@@ ale , which were mir@@ ro@@ red by a fountain .

Queens@@ bi@@ Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queens@@ mark Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closing of the &quot; ceiling fan , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 rop@@ es parts .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
the farm , Keith Brown , visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment at the building of Queens@@ ol@@ d@@ res@@ sings .
we are all witnesses of a engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , it is the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck a fin@@ ick@@ y activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of all br@@ ück@@ ing- de@@ cks on their place and the final section of the deck receives a bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to his seat .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp represents a considerable milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of the closure and civil engineering is visible .
after installation of the last street plane and its connection with the expansion of the north @-@ deck , we had to then close the existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling of the northern road bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ ick@@ y activity .
massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
he@@ el , because the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have a good fortune to be alive &quot;
three men have been &quot; lucky enough to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown off at the Fis@@ es@@ ey fishing boat .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat except for their reach , until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found at a Bo@@ je with no life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of coastal boots and were back to the rescue station .
Mr Jones said : &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have been un@@ hurt and still alive at life .
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it dis@@ band@@ ed the boat from the Bo@@ ots of the person who controlled the boat .
today , someone weighed about these men .
seriously injured - a man looks at his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police ha@@ sted yesterday , the 50 year old had the keys to get the place to get his personal things .
instead of dis@@ car@@ ing the in@@ sof@@ ised perpet@@ r@@ ator , the clothing of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend is dis@@ car@@ ded .
when this came into the apartment , he sto@@ oped with them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hands and the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothing of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ ar@@ ming then his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 year old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her companions out of the house .
on the street they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment , the 50 year old took his sister to the site and attacked his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green said : investors should be much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments during the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; hand @-@ concept living &quot; for the next term .
but dispute is programmed .
in the first line it &apos;s about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a rule is missing .
SPD @-@ Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; we &apos;re on the Green Party : those who want to build urban areas must be able to provide 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
the cheap apartments are , however , can be created in stock .
however , the large extent of the town hall was , however , &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are investors wanting to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to have investors on such surfaces at least 10 per cent , but as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
a new municipal housing programme , which will cost millions of cost , will need to be paid for incenti@@ ves .
the problem , so viol@@ ently said : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make a few regulations as possible .
the left will still want to make hardness requirements for investors .
regardless of his , so viol@@ ently , there is a deep@@ ening of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the management administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we get the skilled workers .
but the program does not yet come : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how would you like to reduce the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments , which will run out in the next few years ?
the year 2020 alone will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , so the planned spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now .
furthermore , apartments should have to be thought back into the price binding again .
this is possible in the West .
in one blow , the problem may be solved .
because in the West@@ stadt run the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments could be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : we don &apos;t want to leave the owners , housing companies .
as a result , the number of social dwell@@ ings in the western city is dra@@ stically increased , the target of the so @-@ called mixing @-@ mix .
a concentration of social guards in just a few districts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens are expecting to put it in the discussion .
leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU joins the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean , that not yet a compromise may be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which pays off
it is fascinating , as the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child will no longer walk outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , on screens , has been compl@@ ained about many times during the last decade .
at Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
the screen at the screen was initially restricted to TV , video games , and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities will not exclu@@ de each other .
I prefer , of course , on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that were created on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later there was a drawing series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than the Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smartphones go outside and searching for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who have been tra@@ ced with a GPS once they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the calf and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments which returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
cardi@@ ac , a app for Apple Watch , followed by the Washington Post that followed by two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , who jum@@ ped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase its performance .
many public expl@@ aining campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day to be active &quot; beat on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people coming up .
nevertheless , the importance of sports may not be evaluated .
whoever drives regularly , reduces its chances of becoming cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to perform it here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people close the hunt even new friends .
as always there are also m@@ ür@@ rical gam@@ bl@@ ers who always have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even if you could follow smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with the time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic at the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now , too , Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast cl@@ assy on Thursday to match the multi @-@ battle tank and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world from all eyes below the spotlight at the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ musician A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American woman Simone Bil@@ e@@ dies on the Swe@@ des during the Single campaign in Women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign , and overall the fifth , while they fixed their reputation to be the best of their generation , or even at all .
it broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long trip took place at this moment .
this success makes them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es domin@@ ates the last three years their sports art , which contains 15 world champion - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals and precision that she said &quot; she has ever seen &quot; the best tur@@ ist I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a final exam in Brazil , a competition which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ lete , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American woman Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after having won gold and silver in the retail trade union of women in the art of art at the Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won
Bil@@ es took the first coin on Tuesday , while she was at the farewell party of Martha Car@@ oly@@ i as a clamation mark .
even though it insi@@ sted on the top , during their long distance to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of its soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , who adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school tour in the gymn@@ asium , was used in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , she has no longer lost any campaign competition , a winning series that will hold as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led through two turns , the picture was beaten .
Swe@@ des and bra@@ ins - in which Bil@@ bao holds the world champion - lau@@ ded .
she returned with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ des again - and set it on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her as her en@@ rich@@ ly a@@ waited - a pure form@@ ality - and tears abo@@ de on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision they once described in its collection , became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ man was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old female capit@@ als which is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after their land , they threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes was dou@@ bt@@ ful .
at the beginning of this week , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ers shot by car in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of war by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a tour , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ held weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled to another vehicle , to be read in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder would not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory excess , because the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police report by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators have led the investig@@ ators to become a close look , whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks and two more viol@@ ated .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to manifest the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers .
Ellis , 33 , was de@@ centr@@ alized because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness shared with the police that it was not unusual for them to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ked car .
the authorities also published a police report on shooting , which led to an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the factory &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother loves .
but how the f@@ ew@@ est of his aging has Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that did not know his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was I create that .
I don &apos;t create this .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
what &apos;s not right at all - naturally , one has left out , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Edmund has never seen them in circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to meet him .
&quot; I didn &apos;t know my first answer to &apos; I didn &apos;t know that the people still do , &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with a help .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he makes progress slowly .
it can run and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing myself something to me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a string at &quot; , telling Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not typical characters -- it says . Edmund has invented some character alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic such as Edmund and Inf@@ ections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary strongly .
it is still too early to say how to influence the life that is infected with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t really know .
I have been asked for a long time after the progn@@ osis , because I don &apos;t expect someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it &apos;s getting better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , flood events in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor on Friday to proc@@ laim the emergency . it will reck@@ oned all Saturday over with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the pp@@ is flooded her banks and threatened with vast floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the national weather service reported .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards shared that state officials are standing in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , shared that the inquiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have had ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service left that in this area an additional 3 @-@ 5 inches could be dropped to rain .
in the south of Alabama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while the region &apos;s mobile continued to rain .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will reach the record level of all probability after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ ward flood of floo@@ ding in Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , because these rivers are slowly flowing through Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the River Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still zu@@ res people from the flood water in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his boots were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , above night .
he said that another step of boots , who lives near , would have been warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had lived in the 48 years in whom she had lived there , never seen such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency service had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floods &quot; had spread quickly , &quot; since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls , and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a ob@@ servers close to Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been substantially full of rain since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lesson in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a half @-@ ordered houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had ra@@ ped 200 survi@@ ving houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which now both were flooded .
the pre@@ sidents of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets which were ang@@ ed by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to host the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand @-@ bags for residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great flood which we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in the right , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys stated that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a hand@@ ful houses have been reported on Thursday as a flooded , but on Friday they have not been reported .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I saw water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; composed of balls , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child will be shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several noise injuries , including in the lungs , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in his transport to the hospital with consciousness .
&quot; he has made a lot , his small body was sol@@ dered by balls , &quot; shared his grandmother Del@@ ic@@ om@@ yr@@ z in the transmitter .
I can &apos;t just believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as a critical hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boys &apos;s family shared the station with that he is expected to see again .
he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable condition .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , reports on the station .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police determined whether they could be under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a cruise between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , who were tra@@ ced to various assault rif@@ ug@@ es , survi@@ ves the crime scene .
it seems that it clearly acted for an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were leg@@ umes .
thus , there seems several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; divided police officers Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also met in the area .
there was no arrest and the police have been reviewed , according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket at the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
they are re@@ covering and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present among women &apos;s ol@@ ym@@ ers in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics , and that is out of more than a reason .
first of all , I have been with every Sommer@@ ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ ade since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three turbul@@ ences , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Hern@@ an@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ o@@ lics in is abr@@ asive , makes everyone proud .
this crew finally reflects the United States .
it has the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport art .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ists a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Hern@@ an@@ dez as they were unexpected , but master@@ y Gy@@ ma@@ stics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold for women with an individual campaign event .
man member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but I do not see gym classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it in the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team is only four trumpet in the team . furthermore , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns will unite the expensive sport and Turner first line in private gymn@@ asium who will maintain their parents &quot; training , setup , travel clothing , travel and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and families ) . the list may continue to continue .
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in weal@@ thy suburbs , which can support the business .
in these verses , Turner will receive their entire training and this is for families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Hern@@ an@@ dez , have trained both of their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ ast@@ ics .
we have to be inspired by the congregations of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ accessible gym training .
I founded my gy@@ ro@@ ud of 20 years ago .
in my events we offer free and affordable gymn@@ ast@@ ics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trains national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to provide the young high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination of the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification for the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long benefits for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to interest , and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , barrel her so many young girls with different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute concerning the changes due to adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assist@@ ants who dis@@ assembled at a choice .
in July , Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS would have committed itself to a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to any further delay for people and patients .
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which contains modifications to night@@ - and weekly works to improve the maintenance times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A company for assist@@ ants shared the last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance has responded to the proposed treaty as before serious concerns , in particular , that it will pre@@ heat the current workforce crisis and to treat all doctors to treat all doctors . &quot;
only eight weeks later , the first group of doctors have to fall under the new treaty , progress has to be made progress and time runs out .
efforts to participate in the BM@@ A solution for disp@@ utes within the government to participate in the government and sometimes silence on a valve .
that happened , Jerem@@ y Hunt made it last month until the last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now to raise the vibration and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he did not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are willing to perform additional labour camps .
the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13@@ ,000 ro@@ ine@@ operations and 100,000 appointments , because nur@@ ses and professionals have been included to grant physicians on the stri@@ kers chain .
the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute concerning the changes due to a adoption of the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A wants to have a better week compensation for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , called the Assi@@ sts to end the strike .
mor@@ als said : &quot; labour amp@@ ers reach nothing of the only little , bel@@ t@@ ages but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , pa@@ ws and their families only wor@@ ries , trouble and dis@@ ruption . &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the Com@@ ment@@ ee of Assi@@ stance , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to respond positively to concerns about the accus@@ ation and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .

the £ 2 @-@ per day , the heart attack can lower the heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 per day drug after the authorities recommended to submit this more people to a longer period .
the inner drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the regulatory Authority N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory Authority N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fet@@ al material in the arter@@ ial walls , which are cover@@ ings .
when the layer breaks out , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots , causing the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through blood flow and flow blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , this risk is reduced by the risk of blood cl@@ ots .
the design of N@@ ICE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month in@@ gest@@ ion of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health evaluation process , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all individuals who suffered a heart attack , have a heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ute consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have substantial negative effects on quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
thanks to a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to expand treatments options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . no treatment is recommended for this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness letting election fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ a Rah@@ man was arrested last year on leaving a government report due to corruption from the office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the widespread elec@@ torate in Muslim congregations will be ignored like a devastating governmental report today .
the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town houses to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse concerning Eth@@ nic@@ ity and Religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corrupt voters , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that it should be permitted to protect the police outside of bal@@ ances to protect dis@@ cour@@ aged voters .
he recommends that voters should bring a reference to their identity in order to prove their identity .
currently , a voters must call his name and address .
the report suggests , not remote ink on the finger of a person , when they give her voice , to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric says .
it claims that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of not official compromise or working groups .
&quot; it is not only for voting rights , but should also be the municipal government before the wider corrupt and finance culture that comes to protect , &quot; he said .
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a consequence of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the am@@ ending Mayor Lut@@ a decided to corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ tes .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or a consequence of im@@ itation , one person who cho@@ oses one person .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of sc@@ am in the whole country .
he insi@@ sted mainly al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - where older members of Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ stain the electoral system , including the leaders of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on the need of ethnic minority members was administered , especially women and young people in order to vote according to the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ quet background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to su@@ stain the system , including the ban that political activists edit correspondence to stop &quot; elec@@ ts . &quot;
the report submitted by Ther@@ esa May in Er@@ weak@@ ening demands also tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory for immigration and social purposes .
options to consider , voters want to ask for your identification .
not remote ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she gave her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic insp@@ ections on the nationality of a person carry out to ensure that they are in@@ discrimin@@ ated .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to a automatic mail @-@ selection .
ban the political activists of the elections and env@@ elop@@ es of the elections .
the police give the powers to set bul@@ locks around election stations .
a legislation that facil@@ itated an indictment due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( 1983 ) .
photographer in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the constitu@@ encies ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensive training of training , to ensure that the staff will rule the rule that voters alone go into the electoral cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets fall not imp@@ aired .
&quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has Lut@@ a Rah@@ man and his deputy on the corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ question@@ able , &quot; he said .
based on a number of reasons for a reason - according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings - pleaded not guilty .
he is also crit@@ ici@@ zed the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the municipal registered departments of the town hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court part in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country carries as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten these good reputation .

the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .

buyers in Pri@@ mark emp@@ s over woman who tried in the middle of business am@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman moved away their clothes in the midst of a mark to try sub@@ jug@@ s .
in order to deterior@@ ate the situation , they were mu@@ stered as she looked in it , and put them back into the shelf .
they continued and tried four pairs of sub@@ jug@@ s in a store in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ stone , in which the woman tried the under@@ min@@ ent before she put them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who had been at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she had gone again and the shop left without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; People were unable to believe what they saw . &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales surface , she took a pair of sub@@ jug@@ s from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew its own shr@@ inking and tro@@ users out and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little discre@@ et@@ ly place to do it - it was just there , nau@@ gh@@ ty as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ red as they drew the sub@@ missions again , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , because they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three more sub@@ missions , before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t liked it , and went out and out .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that they watched someone - or about the person who would buy the sub@@ missions , which it had tried . &quot;
Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think that someone would take home to his own house which had a different person and not have been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday .
Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to move the garments from the sale , after she went - what is the same . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sau@@ cers and find out that another woman had arrived and returned and did not have been washed . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of weapons .
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com might make him safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to change with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or rear , this video will show you how to switch for your rob@@ bers on the sk@@ ewer .
when you were cancelled from behind , you should turn right away , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and get out of the line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee into the bodies and rotate , while the att@@ ack@@ ers came together against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backward , while they turn the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers who approach the front , technology is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
at the same time , you put the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving forward and the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est to be on the saf@@ est , your money - as long as you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ masters .
travel@@ ogue Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide for his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ nourished his immune system and appreciation of a serious examination - by blocking some of the dirty and ec@@ ar@@ rests places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel guide Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ch@@ ased his course on a Euro @-@ donation , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse head of a separate toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before leaving any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and let us see what he will get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; a few surprising results in daylight .
the thought , sl@@ ing the push button of a pulling toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may really be sho@@ ck@@ ered , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria and his own health .
luck@@ ily , nothing left out what he stretched , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ines , traveled by the world and ate unique and wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ ar@@ ches of toilets , the task indicated his immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge water . &quot;
in the film , he was justified by his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ ofs showed a lumin@@ ance number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ance number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to block after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry rate was over 4000 units , while fresh @-@ washed hands have a little less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel guide &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ ium number in different places like the bathroom .
in the film , he says : &quot; this is the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing dirt better than that !
there is nothing here , because it is inside here .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ d Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating about to look and simultaneously explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings by allowing that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday life , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and the documentary we could provide for more information on an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he thought some of the things I have to le@@ ak@@ y , like the ek@@ el@@ ian Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to lead them , and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats . &quot;
in a survey conducted by validation of 84 percent of all respondents , lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , said they have at least occasionally use products which included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was unable to repair the apartment .
she said , &quot; It was for people here an absolute night@@ mare and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider because this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had added , street fights with bases , abuse of investors , drug abuse , drug dealers and excessive scre@@ ams , spreading and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , was an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demolished under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden ben@@ ches were in@@ timi@@ dated .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and the police had to be called regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner this week violent by the property after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunte@@ ered .
the del@@ og@@ ation of ligh@@ tened neighbours were che@@ ered , they said that their life was made to hell .
one said : &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the winter@@ ed side of the municipal house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it ab@@ dic@@ ts the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
that was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely bright and had to be terrible for her neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have made us the information we have done .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate a lot of neighbours and con@@ veys the message that ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at various times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .

she claimed that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who came into a car accident in 2013 .
since they were without a shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms within the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are del@@ og@@ ous , not to keep in order .
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall divided the delay of a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not comply with the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is also missing .
the German suffered a b@@ ump in the workout at the workout , with at least the request at Bar@@ ca , at least in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ ists are already competitive in Barcelona for two years around the status as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique did not de@@ fer a clear decision on this decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ abi@@ des in most of the remaining candidates .
in front of the first mandatory game of the new game , there is doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was hum@@ ili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool , with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ gi@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. was not really convincing .
Sevilla in turn left the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup towards Real Madrid and stri@@ ves the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
with so far eleven successes of the record winner in Barcelona is now available .
Ma Long in one &apos;s own league on table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title def@@ ender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) .
the world ranking first won the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ ć@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made itself the title among themselves .
that was clear that the third time in a row a Chinese will take the single title in the character of the five rings .
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia staircase was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö legi@@ on@@ aire ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the plate alone , between the sets and at time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they were withdrawn into the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests in the fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finals I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang was fol@@ ly told .
after the Game of the gold and silver medal winner with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
after that , he set up the temp@@ o on the top and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
due to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , the a@@ waited Match is not developed .
however , there were sufficiently stunning ball@@ ots to see .
Mi@@ kl@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ finals of the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov had drawn up a ri@@ pp@@ ment , then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately , &quot; had to be content with metal .
by the way , the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become a similar big table in the Olympia @-@ Fourth .
Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pill@@ aged by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional conservative states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave now weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed as something as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the republi@@ can camp , then the doubt of his success will grow in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ icals , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
guilt be false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media .
republi@@ can high bur@@ gers
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June to June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor were present in the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front of the front , but not with the distance that are common for republi@@ can candidates .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
in an interview with the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump addressed the question as he wants to stop the Clinton &apos;s invasion : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
and if behind : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is nothing different to tell &quot; the truth . &quot;
if it is not rich for him on the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , it is okay , said tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump threat@@ ens to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present no better toler@@ ances .
rather than what would you want to increase the candidates of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to Congress stronger among the arms .
Olympia : three ister sc@@ am with D@@ oping Test
the IOC wants to set a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission to the case .
Ken@@ ias athletes born after the Second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach to Kenya .
the International Olympic Committee , promp@@ ted to establish a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission immediately , to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian@@ ic func@@ tionary had communic@@ ated that the former Sprinter and current coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the Team head Ken@@ ias have been reported by the D@@ oping @-@ Controll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IOC to get information about the case in order to rig@@ orous their investigations into the IA@@ AF .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will give an assessment , &quot; it was called the IA@@ AF Declaration .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal text and signed , &quot; declared Ken@@ ias boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
he was owned by the Ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list of training courses in the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth round about 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ i had been withdrawn from the Rio Olympics .
he is alleged to have informed the money @-@ payments of his country through upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested on his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has already been under particular observation at the IOC after numerous d@@ oping tests .
in the announcement of the IOC &apos;s announcement of more than 2000 d@@ oping tests before the Rio Olympics , it was also un@@ noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into the visa .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure to the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ beginning .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took over from the list of countries , whose d@@ oping fight is with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the country championships won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , the ARD has always been le@@ ased to easily accessible D@@ oping funds and should give it a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ru@@ gs .
IOC &apos;s member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian ath@@ le@@ tics .
in this case , it could be demonstrated that in this sport @-@ area and systematically controlled .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one Master@@ piece .
artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the classic temple and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth dream .
in the orchestra , Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra , under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he weak@@ ened .
we always say that they are very Latin .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older called Mary .
she remembers her loving kindness with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ates me .
first because it is exceptional and exceptional !
and then Mari@@ as &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I of Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I @-@ Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course , n@@ ai@@ v , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have known as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honour for us to work with her .
it is a terri@@ fic person .
and Bart@@ oli is the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that &apos;s very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ cher@@ cans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as confident as that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London &apos;s school teacher that joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British teachers who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ n@@ ime A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that their family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria some weeks ago .

in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school children rose from the east of London in a plane direction Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .

Rei@@ d says Clinton become a candidate for the Supreme Court as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton nominated the judge Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is the opinion that the next President will ren@@ ame the successor of Anton@@ in Sc@@ en@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
on Thursday during a telephone conference , Rei@@ d was able to select &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; by Clinton to choose a certain degree of certainty .
a speaker from Rei@@ d said later that he would not have spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ less@@ ness with a new candidate .

Tre@@ ats wants N@@ ack@@ er@@ cal@@ endars for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine is working with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring the Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but rather than famous naked people , they would like to find out the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his neph@@ ew magazine of classic school players are distingu@@ ish@@ able as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I am doing this for women .
apparently , he is the view that there is no calendar too .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classical n@@ ack@@ ness , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body , &quot; Shaw said in a press release to release the Cal@@ endars .
women will participate in this project because it &apos;s a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing Call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish Community calcul@@ ates mass cur@@ s@@ als
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ ogan is sitting on pack@@ ers suit@@ cases , &quot; says the nature of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish Community of Germany agreed short @-@ term with tens of thousands of protection which fled from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hund@@ red@@ thousand , &quot; believe the president of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard pre@@ h@@ aul of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan , the Kurdish congregation in Germany awaits the Kurdish church in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already passed the Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with pen@@ al transactions , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run .
after the neglec@@ ted p@@ utsch , sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added .
many will start to start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k .
the Chief of Staff compl@@ ained the targeted acquisition of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ eni cities .
thus , Erd@@ ogan wants to increase the transfer to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were wi@@ ped out in the past hundred years or exp@@ elled , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member .
the Chief of Staff demanded that the Federal Government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ ogan and his followers . &quot;
even in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunting &quot; against Erd@@ ogan &apos;s critics .
I feel no longer in Germany last months for the first time .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the fire market as a Gü@@ len @-@ supporters destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics for professional existence .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ ogan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported to the newspaper &apos;s calling on the numbers of the German Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks reported the largest group of asylum authorized asylum in Germany .
at the reporting date June 30 , this will be 11.@@ 386 people , and thus nearly 29 percent of all as will have been accepted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not the war , poverty or sh@@ in@@ eness will not be paid .
asylum shall be entitled to asylum in accordance with the Basic Law , i.e. by state of government , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; then go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in addition , the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heavy Parliament decided at the beginning of the year .
but as far as it is not until now , summer holidays , heat and day w@@ rest@@ ling fight - that bit@@ es itself .
the loc@@ als , who should be persu@@ aded by the election strug@@ gles , are on holiday .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no loc@@ als , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
in addition to this , practical problems come : in the holidays , the posters hang on posters , ballo@@ ons fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers and put off the end voices , only lab@@ eling .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass just under the people over .
the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
exciting , as strongly ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains remaining at the end of the coalition range .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and has been head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ remarkable campaign .
he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ ur@@ ks a little with the people , as it did already his most legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has gotten cold feet and is Chancellor Merkel reli@@ ed the guilt of Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , you &quot; We create &quot; the rise of pop@@ uli@@ sts will be accelerated , which will probably cost the beautiful office .
the CDU with its leading edge data , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has seen how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of election campaign .
she has conceived twice ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to large expl@@ or@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag is located in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Sax@@ da as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to Germany &apos;s other corners , Angela Merkel ref@@ uses to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU ren@@ ounces largely on the usual campaign conditions on market grounds and shopping m@@ alls with s@@ uns@@ ha@@ des and ballo@@ ons .
this , therefore , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you have br@@ ushed out the basis that they must be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are here like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the times of the country there is hardly anything .

because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign .
in surveys , Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD gained a clear 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , would have to create the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holiday @-@ emergency and lay their election campaign to change the Internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; call it the national president Claudia Müller .
otherwise there are green election fighting on track ensu@@ es after local stim@@ ulation .

B@@ 27 san@@ itation : restaurants and restaurants under blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
for those responsible for the construction of the construction , starting at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is sole praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the end of October , until the end of October , all will be ready .
blessed is also the punishment of those responsible for the construction works , about when it comes to the establishment of heating drives .
from the construction site on Monday to the south , and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the traffic situation in the place has relaxed .
citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
different traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the Chief Executive Officer Florian King .
the native of Bach &apos;s street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many ble@@ aches sought after and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the signs .
in addition , what led to other trucks in residential areas .
as well as the speed lim@@ es were not kept , the church reinforced the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were significant beliefs , &quot; says King , who made yourself a spot on the location .
two to three per minute has been lit@@ tered .
the quick@@ est was at 77 km / hour in the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
but since the construction site has gone on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the road is open again .
in the cards , business@@ men don &apos;t want to look like .
but that the B @-@ 27 san@@ itation has led with them to sales , everybody asks you to look through .
however , some more and some less affected .
those who have to do with the &quot; end client &quot; has less to do so for other companies , which has barely any consequences for the development .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; most light decline , &quot; but also a fact that of course , &quot; the running of course is missing . &quot;
on the strongest ones are the local along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all guest rooms have hit it hard . &quot;
they were missing the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad about every Euro .
in order to increase sales , the sales were over 50 percent . &quot;
road plans have been put into operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half were dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Mr. Jörg Schmidt is on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the note that the restaurant had benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now she also has to carry the dis@@ advantages that arise through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
at all sounds , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will pass on .
finally , family enterprise has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , which he refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now because of the complicated traffic control less frequently , it can understand .
if you cannot drive , it is also very nice anyway .
that his gene@@ alog@@ y after the end of the san@@ itation work returns , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 works on its customers for the largest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
it is constantly smoking in the name of terror attacks on laws .
according to recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now entering a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner tell all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ ner .
all his proposals were contrary to the coalition partner &quot; politically , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Justice at the presentation of his new security package .
they are demanding to anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in it .
but the Minister of Interior , however , was placed on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the Coalition .
after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented a little time before he presents his conclusions to the security in the republic .
but now they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , p@@ onder@@ ing : that a new safety authority to en@@ code your communication encrypted communication is not new .
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and arms .
the call to more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising .
for part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second run for proposals that have not been to do with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ y for counter groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; these are difficult points for the SPD , &quot; dreamed of the CDU man .
he still hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demanding anything , which has no opportunities in the coalition partner .
a few new ideas show@@ cases de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partially in itself : it plans fast procedure for shifts and more possibilities for the detention of people prior to deportation .
refugees that will be picked up into the country should be submitted to their smartphones and submit social media account for a security check .
at Dul@@ ce for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants some more worse than so far - such as those who walk crimes or their papers have to throw away their identity .
some of them is political and legally .
man@@ ches also seems un@@ balanced and can be asked questions .
and with some points - at the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not obvious to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people in view of the high number of refugees are concerned about safety .
and things that have under@@ gone the human beings , now did not leave the campaign in election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
safegu@@ arding is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly difficult at the topic of inner security .
in the past days it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then concerning a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ees also demand a bur@@ ka ban and demand a conversion from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also working here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a return from a double @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
you can re@@ consider , be not sensible .
and in a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he had constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ solid , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must still be demonstrated .
there is a lot in it , which could take care of dispute .
however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing himself in the topic of inner security .
party director Sig@@ mar Gabriel indicated a c@@ auti@@ ous conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to contribute to the safety of security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still very limited by .
despite diesel fuel , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
with the response reaction there are vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e to a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands , Europe &apos;s biggest car park , Europe can continue a further increase in spite of the diesel engines thanks to its many brands and a few more @-@ run markets .
but in July , the core brand VW was weaker especially in Western Europe and resi@@ sted the overall sales , as that in the D@@ ax has recorded business .
in July , the brand was sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year .
in the home market Germany , the deliveries were almost a sixth of sixth .
marking Chief of Chief Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , the weaker numbers in July were back on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has been given a change in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the exit from the EU , explained a speaker .
in the United States , where the emission of exhaust first escal@@ ated , there is also a min@@ us to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the government &apos;s mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue to increase the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only 0.9 per cent of vehicles can be reduced to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler was further ongoing from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million wag@@ ons to re@@ armament into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW decided that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after changing the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
the car of the customer , according to the conversion of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company &apos;s business .
reason to be legal experts .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models .
these were confirmed by VW @-@ representatives in the federal state ministry last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and to fulfill its full @-@ duty team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
VW has taken over the guarantee that , with fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after changing no deterior@@ ations , and all the relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in the table .
in the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers may come to a workshop about half a year after the conversion , with a engine damage to a garage , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also , in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of some other damages , which have nothing to do with the g@@ ob@@ sc@@ andal that comes with no safegu@@ arding regarding possible warranty regulations , as it was called .
therefore , VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands interest rates in the future punishment - as the second Institute in Germany .
ban@@ ker Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or day deposits . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single fall , and does not see it any signal : normal savings would not be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ ins . &quot;
store bank money at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros on gyp@@ sum or day deposits .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost over 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
it has been around 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other , and he could not be able to use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t go for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
he continues to give the cost after the Mor@@ si principle .
the cash simply lie in the kill@@ ers of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four fail@@ ures , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment .
only few walking to other banks .
the co@@ operative federation of Bavaria explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs . &quot;
they alone contribute to wear , be &quot; business permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 from three million Euros .

destination records : who actually buys sound plates ?
lon@@ ely adult males love plates .
before you ha@@ sten@@ ed to the comm@@ end@@ ations to over@@ se@@ er him under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ aging defects , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lication of sound plates is not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life Nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a plate , are all of the fore@@ sight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather than ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ g@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit , before I stand up , my hands hold and something to decide : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a close look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os are slowly ta@@ xed to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there is a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , the I of Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men mean age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) follow , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not have followed him at home ) , dressing the walls of his home .
the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy records , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared as I was 11 or 12 . things I thought to be too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
it is true that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I smoke not and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my truck .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , believes that many customers who meets he meets the You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ y , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let us see again their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people usually have dis@@ agre@@ eable about 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of followers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record business offers a soo@@ thing community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older clients participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confi@@ dently sound disc , of objects , the happy che@@ es@@ der@@ ations .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void , or possession of material poss@@ essions to be a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is with me as a collector , and I think it &apos;s so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered a employee from a turn@@ out stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a plate , have no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I bl@@ amed through a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova compilation .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data : three men of middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ č .
&quot; someone arrived recently here and said : &quot; I have no record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musical loads .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older who come only slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an empty audience when I go to clean .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle aged .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ tant Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ones from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity in the customers .
none of them looks particularly lon@@ ely , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to be determined if one stands for about 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes , watching the Vari@@ et@@ es for sale on sale .
it is rather a shov@@ el @-@ star@@ red than a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , therefore , records of records are not real option , it says .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to any other way , but the beauty of records is ... it drives with a loved epidemic .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit the je@@ ans to master Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young Teen@@ agers , who is group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them on - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch it .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates .
even if my investigations were revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in turn@@ tables in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers exist , which exist in reality , turn@@ tables , and on@@ line@@ ages .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security , not with the b@@ umm@@ ets by record shops of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they face the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator that rises over the shoulders of nothing more impressive men of middle age .

French court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of stores in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
in case of a trial proceedings , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should be carried out to sell 72 studies in the camp goods , from cigarettes to energy drinks , selling hair@@ dresser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or a simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would not be paid a parallel economy from which no tax would be paid and that a fire and san@@ itation s@@ bergen .
humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important because the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 Pro@@ visional Shops , but admitted that the concerns of Cal@@ ais &apos;s pre@@ fecture are completely re@@ plac@@ eable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as only people live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas were quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the low mor@@ sel , the Jungle Book Kids &apos; Café des bearing , is a non @-@ profit @-@ profit and a consultation with asylum causes for hundreds of protective needs , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation speed measurement : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accidents , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on the highway construction or to renov@@ ating bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary b@@ itter for compliance with the speed limit .
a lasting mobile structure can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is autonomous : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operations , the case data will be encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured simultaneously via multiple tracks .
variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments as well as driving distance to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitor .
in the highly folded state , you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hook .
in order that it is not easy to cl@@ asp , it is lowered to a measurement operation so that the wheels in the pan and by the way also van@@ ish safe outdoor shell .
moreover , a built @-@ in alarm system is to protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
even foreign authorities , with the new technology : recently , France has sold 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after the Master@@ class Gold pic@@ ks up
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at a rup@@ ting stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated by a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ aler stage , here in Rio .
in Fiji the master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , line @-@ run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of silver medal - Great Britain fourth this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in semi @-@ final on the same day could drop to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji had a 15 @-@ man team in their shape .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a bridge will be a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind .
she lost eight years ago under Ryan any game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they only lost one here .
this sle@@ ek will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and released the GB@@ S attacks from fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when one would run in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au retired in the corner .
in four minutes later , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball .
a h@@ ep@@ tive T@@ ackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch @-@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new tour since the restart and there was still over a minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ pped through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , when Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB still had to be se@@ eded .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time by and completed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went straight after a brilliant play @-@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running for a long time in favor of the South Korean , whose fans sang , f@@ ew@@ ays and d@@ anced at the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame won the i @-@ pond with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ fi@@ ff heard that Fi@@ j@@ is h@@ ug@@ ged and GB k@@ ic@@ iled were defeated in the lawn .
in the days , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half into the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on interrupted the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ side teams , secured the profit and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no engine gold than with these games , and that wants to be hot .
from the first rowing machine to the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve , who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only the appl@@ ets that sat at the ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was always present at the second Olympic champion in a row without tax wife , the first women in the history of the British sport that laid such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ protected use , which is also an exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ tering , which reflects on the surface with the elegance of go@@ ings , which does not reflect the type of the Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind every gold in rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on cons@@ ented to content that make the difference and there was no more hel@@ pl@@ ess than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , he spreads anywhere .
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start what was the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ firm@@ ity of victory there went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a annoying morning so much more than anything else and thus trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal artill@@ ery regim@@ ent in a use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much me this means , how much I and Helen and Robin worked together .
three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for coaching or better train@@ ers .
Helena Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were really caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of itself .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not able to do some T@@ oll@@ es .
we wanted to have no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race which we did .
the couple will take place for a year before making decisions on his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is regarded as a &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide . &quot;
a small fr@@ en@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the great water producer .
so it was a few days ago in the origin@@ als in a post of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken joined forces .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group was &quot; Bavarian far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , which was 31 years in Zw@@ eck@@ ert Employ@@ ees , had 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Municip@@ ality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants .
member states are the congregations of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for other cities and municipalities .
the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor of the Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set as a water@@ bed in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ Association &apos;s executive board in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extend from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the recovery of water pipes .
there have been no lac@@ tation and I have always taken new innovations , because water de@@ pressed and drinking water the most important food .
she has praised G@@ öl@@ ler &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for its water purpose and he has been able to do the water @-@ purpose association as it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago , he considered a true pract@@ iti@@ oner of the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ einer group for nit@@ rat@@ sen@@ ation in front of the water forum of the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for that , he received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s part praised Aqu@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and re@@ structure of the Zw@@ eck@@ Association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , were the pi@@ ping at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here , minus 17 degrees the whole night is to work through , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn have only been maintained , because it filled the floods of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ um@@ ps .
the management of the drinking water Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man moves to li@@ fel@@ ess
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man took place on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner , killing them fatal .
&quot; the man called upon us , and given us to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ess , &quot; said a police report .
the perpet@@ rators is on the run , after him will be publicly declared .
meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown , and has a g@@ ossi@@ p .
meanwhile , the police released a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon for himself , so the police .
he who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship relationship . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any data to the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a red@@ dish @-@ deli@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; more we do not say , &quot; said a police report in Lübeck .
according to witnesses , a special case was delivered ( SEK ) at the crime scene .
steel - light view of the German steel industry
the risk @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens , which are threatened by the industry , are threatened by the table .
it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy revolution in the inventory of the so @-@ called suit@@ ability production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister of Economy , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , the &quot; West German General Zeitung , &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission was initially planned to use the steel manufacturer to use gases coming from the high @-@ oven to electricity generation , to the cas@@ hier .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission after talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works will be replaced , a EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent .
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s deal with the European Commission on the own production .
thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be re@@ written .
a special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; Steel is the future &quot; is that a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; on the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment goals are &quot; explained , &quot; IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann declared in Frankfurt .
the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fy as the world &apos;s largest producer , in view of the weaker domestic demand , threw steel on the global market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concerts prize d@@ umping .
throughout this spring , the situation was relaxed .
for a show , in@@ fusion oil on imp@@ acted effect , for the other , economic outlook in China have been tra@@ pped .
un@@ clear , how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
recently the prices were stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp recently wanted to exclu@@ de cl@@ ut@@ ations of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel manufacturer remains c@@ auti@@ ous despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
with 3,4 million tons , they produced less raw steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the German @-@ German Association mar@@ ched on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount turned back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association ends in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , Spirit , health : to sing elderly people
the S@@ ingen has accompanied her whole life : as a young woman she was in the school choir , in the teaching position she took the subject of music , and today the 78 year old sings in a senior citizen .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes them .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
at the same time , they do something good in their health and mind .
for S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives : a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League .
most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describing H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular occurr@@ ence , senior contacts can slip and maintain .
because often social and family structures solve in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : to arrange and organise themselves on the others , and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coll@@ age . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
for there are seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly calls his lungs , is not so fast in everyday life as fast as the pu@@ rest .
even though it comes to obtain the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labor Community of the Seniors organisations .
in the older generations the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people are w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , people were ex@@ iled to themselves for a long time @-@ lying events .
in the singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , concentr@@ ating on the own voice and on a given rhythm , to adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just older people who live alone , do not just want to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I have long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent is advis@@ able .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ king people , who sounds like a tone beside it ?
searching for the suitable offer , seniors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the most famous circle in a senior fen@@ nel , one can easily connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet access .
those who want to sing , should necessarily be connected to a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has something free - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ v@@ ingly as a cat on scre@@ ams of the young
Bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which has the effect of cat bab@@ es on adult animals .
in their surprise , the people did not get cold nor cold - however , they beha@@ ved himself in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the exc@@ itation of cat bab@@ ys at the age of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens , who chose to be found in great emergency , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cat also respond to the calls of kit@@ ten - but always equal .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the ten@@ tion of less and strong imp@@ lications for the males either un@@ perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first author@@ ship in the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten scre@@ b is different with the drums of their help .
a total of nine adult male and eight caps were observed from the animal welfare of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a ru@@ fe of little ones , which were taken up for three minutes from the litter box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the other , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ enings of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens , which were lifted up in addition .
the researchers comply with their results despite the low sample sample .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring re@@ acted in the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this ru@@ fe played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be born or developed using the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the male responded at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on a baby noise .
also some studies showed that women were acting sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey against the ru@@ sty football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür .
he is accused of being a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey there is again an important football match .
prior to the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clearly stated : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already at the suspension of emergency , after the revolution attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of normal vou@@ chers should not be imp@@ acted .
but this is not true for those who are suspected of the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
this is also not done before the football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür an arrest warrant issued an arrest warrant .
in the meantime , the South of America &apos;s living door is accused of being a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ ür should be the followers of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan .
although initially for 90 days of emergency state is still valid until October , in fact , it has no effect on the life of most Turks , but as good as no imp@@ lications .
the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places in the whole country has declared Erd@@ ogan on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into tra@@ ilers and opponents Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not involved with the friends of the president .
but what the Turks of the Turks have recorded some dramatic experience in the history is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
even the fans even agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
for poker winning &quot; Gala &quot; it will definitely come back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Köl@@ ner exhibited its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competition , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he completed the season in an outstanding manner and secured the cup of his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion was a con@@ cili@@ atory degree .
after the Pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; say early in Europe &apos;s League early .
in the south of Li@@ g there was only rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who took place with 26 seasonal boards as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shake , the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
on the occasion of the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had only been able to lend to the P@@ utsch@@ er Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , due to the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must just say , &quot; Rec@@ ent the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Head F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
but the storms would have to be willing to give rise to around a third of its estimated 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary at Florence , we can not pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have still medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio Olympics
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ oms in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
others brought ath@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinners to laugh about it - they fight in Rio around medals .
the topic D@@ oping determines how before the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping lock her start just before the games , was p@@ inn@@ ed and hat@@ ched at its start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a red smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance with her appearance .
as determined that they won &apos;t take gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ tower .
but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men who are going to launch in Rio at the Rio Olympics in spite of d@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the ath@@ le@@ tics .

bomb horror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
she had suffered mo@@ cked and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left again .
they planned their home journey to start at the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the holi@@ day@@ island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , are also still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand up in a medium @-@ sized contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital , Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded by two bombs at the Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ ateral was killed and approximately 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian woman , three Germans , three low@@ lands and three Itali@@ ans .
early in the morning , two explo@@ res came up , and another man was killed according to the authorities .
Phu@@ ket was also declared a bomb blast in the morning .
at the Det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured as a police station .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal workers .
the explo@@ sives , according to the authorities in a flower bed , went into the air before the Re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , whose name was .
&quot; the bom@@ bers bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army @-@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself as possible moti@@ ves - probably do the deeds of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media wanted to detect a pattern with the proposals that is typical for the bom@@ bers of the country in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the contrary , stated that attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rule movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one rather go out that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received secret services related to the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they are not informed about the exact date and places .
the group is still un@@ clear , which group behind the suggestions .
the police acted all over the country , security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the Well @-@ hungry bom@@ b@@ ings explo@@ sions the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his homepage , to make instructions of the Thai security authorities necessarily .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
following disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , non @-@ necessary travel in these provinces are dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) used for the rest of the country .
on Thursday and Friday a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this dre@@ amt of the military major influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs are an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , to improve economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , holds itself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not have managed to handle the military in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago , in Bangkok , during an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is in the Vis@@ i@@ ard of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection .
after several regional offices , the constitu@@ ents in the League have set up the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; disposal points for punishment against the freedom democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional leader Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin .
such a Muslim faith , or the N@@ ear East , are diff@@ used by the N@@ ear East in the extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement .
the &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is a group of group with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
constitu@@ ents in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Niedersachsen , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - watch the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority has voted closely with the regional meetings .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; trying to pick up their target group , where she stands , &quot; said the constitutional leader .
generally , extrem@@ ists try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as acts as legal extrem@@ ists .
this is not a perfect advertising for your own cause .
propaganda is supposed to speak emotional .
young people are there in a special way .
this is dangerous .
recently , it was given out of several federal states reports on the contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; to Af@@ D polit@@ ician .
Ma@@ ate said he did not have any findings .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts this species can only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist , will change their target and so extrem@@ ist .
so , if such persons control the party on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the significant increase of rectangular off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee quot@@ ations , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new law in this context .
but we found in recent years that there can be rectangular structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that further rectangular group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , plan against refugee sh@@ ines or attacks from other right @-@ law moti@@ ves .
however , a German @-@ wide or europ@@ ean control of legal terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
so , they were worried about that many over@@ ings come to the account of people who had not entered the right scene in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the Tat@@ ry @-@ suspected attacks on asylum meetings were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimes or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences who had nothing at any time with legal extrem@@ ists , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or Left Left , who have become radic@@ alised with the extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;

at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the lightweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he wasn &apos;t able to see any more in the TV images .

in the social networks , Hab@@ te was then moved to vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended its predecessor with a return of 48 seconds , and took the 59@@ th place of 59 starters .
but it was rather his not just spor@@ tive figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start of the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ lining countries .
as in Et@@ th@@ op@@ ia run most athletes , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name came the round .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;

his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Freestyle , there was no role played .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the eel &quot; were also drawn .
with the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the course of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i used the course of media attention .
unforgettable , the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Freestyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ etic was fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .

accidents - Bus sli@@ t in c@@ umm@@ ber@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
during an accident of a travel agency with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ es@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered heavy injuries , the police shared with .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach had to devi@@ ate their data to the opposite L@@ aster , which drove to the opposite train .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a female speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus , &quot; she said .
the fire delivered the occup@@ ier .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured passengers were brought back from a liner bus back to the cal@@ um@@ ber@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators requested the load @-@ experienced and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metres of waste are starting from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( up to 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
in the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage costs will be increased by then , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
according to a corresponding calculation , the se@@ wage rates in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the hom@@ olog@@ ation of the budget was established by the Coun@@ cill@@ or and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that works for these se@@ wage systems .
due to right foundations , the Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to operate the facilities available .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial units from world leaders , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to interv@@ ene deeper into the pur@@ se .
the number of bones are between 48 and 67 percent .
as an administrative director Herbert Schmidt on the panel , a new circulation of the fees for the se@@ wage plant was necessary .
during the period of October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calendar period will be the same .
founded in all three se@@ wer@@ age , Schmidt established that it is relatively small with all three se@@ wage plants with a very low se@@ wage plant , which runs between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be engraved .
moreover , the se@@ wage water is slightly decl@@ ining in all three facilities .
furthermore , during the slow@@ down period in all three facilities do not last but due to their age san@@ itation and repair expend@@ itu@@ res in a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for world champion , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that in the Az@@ endorf se@@ wage plant , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
in the p@@ umping pole , the nearly 20 year old convey@@ ing facilities had to be over@@ hau@@ led and after almost 20 years of operation of the first sep@@ tic tank , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge is dispos@@ ed and an additional ventil@@ ating option has to be installed in order to comply with the waterproof specifications .
Schmidt : &quot; to these exceptional expenses , the continuing service and maintenance costs came to be considered according to the new calculations period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012 were still clearly under the current level .
in the three plants , stone houses made clear that the expenditure for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , Schmidt was added to the market town of great entertainment costs during the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous , especially since one could not be expanded in the supply area of the se@@ wage of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al by these equipment because it is about de@@ fied facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian cartoon crit@@ ici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel over the races .
with its filter tool , it enables snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already wei@@ rd to the absurd .
you can transform themselves into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from an Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , independent high @-@ quality tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ ects per day .
all mis@@ entries arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused of being able to prop@@ agate Black@@ face or white skin than beauty ideal .
when they proposed a filter for some Us@@ ers , who gave them sl@@ ums , false teeth and un@@ touched , some critics have known a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated contro@@ versy fell on a larger problem that the company has di@@ vers@@ atility .
the messages and the indig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat ha@@ sted that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as homage to An@@ ime characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but outside that have experienced rac@@ ism , the filter remin@@ ded the filter of vulner@@ able c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose Twe@@ et were widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; infr@@ inging and the least was un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ part of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yel@@ lowing of yellow was drag@@ ged into .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ bee .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in race as their older min@@ ors - could not be expected to expect lowering sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture created for a user , so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineers , decided to er@@ ase the Snap@@ chat account , others to do the same .

military se@@ duction of ISIS intelligence information , represents the Committee of Congress
military operations of the United States Central Command changed more detailed information to draw an optimal @-@ scale picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it permits the actual states of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can Committee , intelligence service Committee and military bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by great dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence intelligence , reported as before their ass@@ essments on the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Services , which were typically sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , regularly published a positive image of the American efforts to terrorism as the actual states on site permits and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article in the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
Cent@@ Com managers range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detail @-@ resistant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government officials submitted by Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts predic@@ t the pressure from their pre@@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command Press releases , ass@@ ump@@ tions and statements made clearly more positive than the fact &quot; presented the report . &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , so much clearly . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Kansas , in a opinion .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the points of Central Command changed the detailed reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were played that analysts are worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations will be continued .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway in the Ministry of Defence Ministry .
Democratic members of the news services published on Thursday their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave up a little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence of a intervention of the White House with Cent@@ Com analysts on a certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times posted an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general insp@@ ec@@ torate , which were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press writing of the Pentagon , gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports during the investigations of the General Assembly .
but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have consistently demonstr@@ ating opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence is a controversial discussion of this important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investigation have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question to the Central Command in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions for the last year .
the criticism of the obe@@ dience information concerning the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , was contrary to the recommendations of many analysts at the recommendations of many analysts at the end of many analysts and a little time on the wall of making thoughts about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led Mr. Hoo@@ ker to speci@@ alise government officials , that contrary to the statements of the Government of the terrorist government , there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since this provisional refin@@ eries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this discovery was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the Legisl@@ ative Assembly on a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went to reti@@ ring in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win four @-@ fourth match in the hockey field of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ Team of women in a match on Thursday that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who retain their goals in memory .
but they know , however : the Americans lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same place in their group with the British , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will be on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will win six teams among the first and second place .
the first place will take a little longer from the way , which lead the other group .
whatever the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after she landed in the past London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey mur@@ derer in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they did not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team worked everything .
in the following year Craig par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thereby began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working horse in London , which we now have .
we can ri@@ p the rest completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ ri@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ drop out of the se@@ am .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it took a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the centre and lu@@ ded the ball into the gate to bring the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the United States , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games so far .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ami@@ dst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , too late , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events feel stable and un@@ avoid@@ able , a tre@@ ading relay between competition and streams .
it is as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is to protect the s@@ wimm@@ ers from the wrist@@ band to Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can not switch to the TV , reading a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queu@@ e in the queu@@ e in Coff@@ es@@ hop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is still Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples , would have definitely be sent among these known names that could be sent to Prime Time , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even fen@@ ders .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold .
the Olympic flame is not illuminated any event .
further from the centre , some in the shade there are sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ons , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming , and may know it for a long time .
but if I expect a modest arguments for my specific love , then you can turn the attention to the discreet charm of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made its debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so much that many of whom I asked , did not know that at all there is a Olympics .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and won a ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for women .
China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain external sec@@ ular charm , partly because it sounds for the un@@ clari@@ fied ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than those that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bad enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ or@@ ously potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ary trem@@ ors of his never to end cr@@ ush - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two sports that combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from Spanish El trampoline , which means so much means &quot; jump board . &quot;
the winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a row of falling mot@@ ions ( turning , h@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before they landing at the feet .
they are assessed by the official Olympi@@ ad program according to design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts hoping to continue in their stri@@ ving after gold , faster , upwards and penet@@ rate , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes and back , upward and down on the playground .
they don &apos;t just hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the television trans@@ ference also another cav@@ ity : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ords .
the targeted Stre@@ ets is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I feel even while watching these games as something tired .
of that , the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or her pr@@ un@@ ing , seem@@ ingly weigh@@ t@@ lessly like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes down , then down , then effort@@ lessly back to the top .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant rising of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final stages of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 .
NBC Announ@@ ces En@@ dr@@ unden as part of an afternoon block at two days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ seen in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be reached by the attack and objec@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal in front of recently - Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air to air , new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a member of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , the political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gled to violent opposition in the government .
witnesses say that they were killed during cl@@ ashes during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just breaking them ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid con@@ voy of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country , and continued to spread more areas .
last week thousands of people invaded the streets and slow@@ ed fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer , according to human rights organisations , was un@@ merciful .
witnesses reported that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on un@@ armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , the videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals hit young people with sho@@ cks , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands an incoming examination now .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and will continue to be more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a Research Group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , particularly in Somalia . only few countries in Africa when at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expands in considerable temp@@ o .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , dis@@ sent@@ ers were effective to silence .
many were put into exile , or put into prison , or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these have no other options except protests , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
one generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land using to the power of the ruling coalition .
following a major critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the ten@@ sions rise along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for these tender , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analy@@ st fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were forced out more or less forced out of turbul@@ ence in recent years and could arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess gets explo@@ de under the surface under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate about internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide , where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians reported that they were so prot@@ ested to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not a natural enemies .
since Et@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which mainly are predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , are in politics and economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in low@@ lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population and the military , in the intelligence services , in trade and politics are dominant .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death in a non @-@ known disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly re@@ compens@@ ated in it to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and to use special agent to make opponents and make them immense .
&quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , is missing a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ c@@ auti@@ ous reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st that it does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after that thousands were protest@@ ing against elections , which were apparently pursued by the Government , and subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ ci@@ en many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went straight ahead .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning , as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Protest@@ ants attacked Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , owned by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred for the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in the social media .
analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies in a unique position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently noted that she closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to inter@@ act together in a vol@@ atile area .
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin crash . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains its asser@@ tion Obama had founded ISIS is &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by removing his multi @-@ repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication designed new questions regarding communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether in the position to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his Mit@@ stre@@ ites , who stri@@ ve to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain to the actual position , which he could not have meant .
after he had made the alleg@@ ations on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the claim on Thursday went back and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning Twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is just sar@@ cast@@ ic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know of it .
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que on Mr. Tr@@ ump desc@@ ends , while he tries the focus of his campaign due to falling down@@ fall values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes , and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already put sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he with@@ drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should give Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s emails , but later , &quot; Of course I thought that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test like certain messages of its fans , as they arrive , and then , &quot; clari@@ fy &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who watches the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
rather than pun@@ ishing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted a more corro@@ sive sound , because its re@@ mot@@ ions are further decreased .
a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a major lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ racing in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his prov@@ ok@@ ement statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics , to dist@@ il his testimony , or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is reinforced with the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought up his loyal fellow soldier to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may be his testimony .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York , and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent inter@@ c@@ eries , gave himself great effort to defend Candi@@ date today in an CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani that he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps claims to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama had an almost unknown , small organization before Obama called her back@@ sli@@ der , completely wrong and thus it happened because he moved troops from Iraq .
most of the ma@@ instream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are attemp@@ ting to argue that the government was under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton used as the Secretary of State to spread it down to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control .
before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them before , on each of his words , and to be over@@ taken with him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t believe it ! &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as only one more evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once more about the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a very colourful café in William@@ sburg , where you could pay only bar that had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ der front .
So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
loc@@ als had been loc@@ alized as the last loss in a devastating town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is change , it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ year employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new outer scale , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ns such as cap@@ ers and auti@@ stic onions .
there are natural extracts .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he not@@ ices a set of electricity to old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were pushed forward by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she was pulled to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave her a while in the coffee pot , she said .
&quot; I was clear that it was at the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b who pleased me , &quot; she said .
now she drinks coffee again , even if she served a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea that day instead of her usual , but another new addition is added .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a second long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he walked in front of the work and kept un@@ wei@@ rd forever .
&quot; I came a quarter to seven , every day as a Swiss tor@@ watch and they prepare my Everything @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal always gets its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Hole Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not have Gro@@ ll about that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee bars as ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café too .
a new customer transl@@ ates the menu of the Polish menu , and Rodri@@ guez said that he preten@@ ded to leave them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ room would like to fill the bott@@ ling coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new Ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the loc@@ als of the Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took lunch in the O@@ val Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ thful for refined delic@@ at@@ essen of Fifth Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Water@@ tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ se@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
the last book &quot; Ch@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ ck@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ rot snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the IP@@ crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cro@@ û@@ te with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable soup .
when trying to fry the Hack@@ ney , this was suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ ch@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap , which scatter@@ eth the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts eat that they serve them as dinners .
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
during the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women co@@ ils for male ri@@ ots and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; distingu@@ ishes the ways , with which the country went with it to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans a central t@@ aller topic , &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
as offensive was the new budget @-@ s@@ own : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and cass@@ ette were used to stap@@ le the cass@@ ette as a &quot; wonderful way , food remains re@@ iter@@ ated , because delic@@ acy could hide in@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a thick sauce .
fresh fruits was replaced by cheaper dry ob@@ st .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutriti@@ ous satisfaction had been given preced@@ ence before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during their research for the book , which also contains recipes , Zi@@ ck@@ man made a court made of this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition in the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeper .
as never before or since then , budget economic systems - including Louise Stanley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
by providing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary sp@@ aghetti , and the challenge to turn P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rot into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
particularly tasty are the reports about the government &apos;s response to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Essen post@@ ure .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa farmers cuisine of his kitchen , he sp@@ elled like the million@@ th man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a almost gilded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was very strange .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same error when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate a stamp with his stomach .
as described in the book , the current owner of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , was rejected , once the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , bri@@ ck@@ ering , as well as science on food .
the pair gave to better understand the recording of the book &apos;s eating habits in mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they didn &apos;t throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ ling incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ au@@ m@@ end@@ ums , the president Roosevelt to noon .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ ch@@ man and added that it was a common trick , with modest recipes to miss a nice name .
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each appeared a little bit be@@ wit@@ ched a spoon into the t@@ ame , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E won a follow three times .

killed on bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat down his own life to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died when the Assad regime was killed .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civilian population , which according to the image newspaper , nearly 60,000 people had saved the lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game to move people from bom@@ bed houses and to make the first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about the shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
but as heroes he has never seen himself , according to the picture , &quot; For me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I die , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he was spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four fac@@ ades over the Alz@@ adia district , was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .

Greenland : the oldest vert@@ eb@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are usually only in winter on the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and floating at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland shar@@ ks get up to 150 years of age .
in an hour , the Green@@ lan@@ hai Greenland runs along the bottom of the North Atlantic , an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters .
only when it depends on it , the five @-@ meter long animal acceler@@ ates at a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this of lon@@ el@@ iness @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a cartridge for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case of Greenland that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ab@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ graphic Research in Rostock these lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist probably susp@@ ects that Greenland was founded in Greenland .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s tro@@ phy are difficult to observe , and finally they live mainly in the Eis@@ meer from Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface only in winter .
the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle know a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her time @-@ thr@@ ill@@ ary they lim@@ bs six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transmitter .
lo@@ ot make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up the pine forest of a young polar bears .
possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look car@@ at , which sw@@ ings out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland &apos;s , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 centi@@ meters long , while the biggest 502 centi@@ meters measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyze the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens appears already before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained in it , will no longer be re@@ done .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
its birth was therefore supposed to be after the early 1960s , when nuclear w@@ aff@@ able try larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in contrast with 220 centi@@ meters in length , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear war , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens core , which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock showed a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre long Greenland , an old age of 335 years , while the record Ha@@ i might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland females first get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to as@@ sign the length of the length .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters are probably the threshold of the sexually mature , and its age of 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks can be found at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be record world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence .
even the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , in whose bacon on the neck , a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the body of the animals live on spar@@ ks living there .
so they mature later - and slow@@ down slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible as many descendants , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist scar@@ f .
however , a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
with topics around B@@ auen , the community at the youngest session has been involved in the most recent meeting .
with relief , the panel adopted the message of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the youngest living areas can begin . &quot;
after having clari@@ fied the plot , plot and conversion requests , the sale of the plots in the housing areas &quot; Street road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( range Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction of construction in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and other senior citizens alike .
as it was called , Bau@@ cons@@ ulate can now report directly in the City Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be advised in his September session .
as well as requests to the res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial establishments , joined the creation of job positions , the Municipal Council decided to re@@ launch the area plan in part in the spring of this year .
in the area of time @-@ lar@@ n , the commercial area has already been expanded by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has therefore , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , winning the best opportunities in London to attract jobs and companies .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt am most likely benef@@ ited at most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Market of I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money stores continue to operate from London from financial stores across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass , the approval in Britain has so far enough .
this is just using big US banks .
multiple banks have already announced jobs to move jobs .
the Lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; Frankfurt am Finance &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of the ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg there is a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
thanks to the great airport , you can reach much easier .
the city further features the city with easily available industrial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in addition , the results for the first @-@ class industrial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , we offer higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the town is on rank 7 , Luxembourg on rank 19 , Dublin on rank 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
even though quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; says the I@@ W .
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
for this , the power conditions also speak : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , about 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives the cost of hepatitis C patent applications with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have made from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a damages amounting to $ 200 million for the injury of two patents from Mer@@ ck , who , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge received a pattern of mis@@ conduct on Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ l and other un@@ ethical actions .

together with Gilead , Mer@@ ck tries to control the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hill@@ ary Clinton published their tax statement for 2015 in the Democr@@ at and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charity purposes mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated sales of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ t candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine in Virginia , published his tax statement of the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; by Clin@@ t Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ em@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a cr@@ ot@@ ted contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false balance and withdraw@@ als in relation to its previous promises to publish its tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidate to publish their tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax examination by tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ t &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN said that he would not allow tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critic , among others also the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already published that his ref@@ using questions regarding assets , his donations for charity institutions , its business seminars and various other compounds , in particular with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown on the theme and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Republican Tr@@ ump to publish his tax statement .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said too much .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump did not pay for two years or only very little taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax @-@ forests and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Federal control has become a subject in the electoral struggle .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people pay more than USD 1 million to make a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to a meeting on their tax declar@@ ations .
buff@@ ett said he was as well as a tax review of the IRS and Tr@@ ump did &quot; fear &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ t Camp@@ aign has released tax statement until 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , have paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax statement by the 2015 Clin@@ t showed that this only USD 100 was relative to their income as wages , unlike the majority of all Americans .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , Fire@@ works by promoting Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
natur@@ alists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to cut eleph@@ ants from being inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chili powder .
the method has proven itself as effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already intensi@@ fied the idea before , in cooperation with the U.S. natural protection , trained by volunteers in the north of Tanz@@ anias , to use a for@@ cible four @-@ ste@@ pl@@ ess method to protect their houses and harvest@@ ing , without breach of animals .
before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend itself .
Friday is World En@@ umer@@ ation Day , dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed ... Tool@@ kit we have developed a change in this municipalities to observe the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damage the eleph@@ ants , &quot; says the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a communication .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
if he is not re@@ lu@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der bl@@ ender with earth is packed together with a fire @-@ maker in a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition will be turned .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom with a button on and spray fine dust from Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air .

Jewish director destro@@ ys Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after the &quot; Arab &quot; exploration - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots has unle@@ ashed a press release after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre@@ fix , since there were Arabic guests to have called &quot; requested . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the list of the hotels .
the country , however , was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , it is possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel noted that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dissolved in the director more wrath .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre@@ fix country is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great confusion , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and seas@@ oned by this event .
that is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this was carried out in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is even a bigger shame .
this requires no explanation .
we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; said the ministers .
the incident dis@@ band@@ ed a pretty great response in the internet , where the people called a sc@@ andal .
some sub@@ ordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been a con@@ genital Arab score . &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly rejected all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; understanding &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , The Spiegel reported .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
according to the abol@@ ition of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , a trading rate between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strong in the land of Russian companies , shared the ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further trading building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
it was noted that the rate of trading between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 was 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was achieved by deliveries of machines , land @-@ aircraft and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representatives of approximately 35,000 Vis@@ as , in the first line of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , issued Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects the number of people in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Irish tourists will be broken in Russia from last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally , I personally recommend visiting Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received mon@@ ol@@ lection of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ med home , as a Br@@ ite Gold for cycling team
Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ged last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when British team def@@ ending the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the sc@@ roll , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made herself mar@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood . the J@@ umping and did the legend proud when he was home to home a victory of the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the back of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time when execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man when they stayed , when they saw full potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winners - and S@@ kin@@ ner set a Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the standing round the New Zealand jum@@ ped in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
hin@@ ge was back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner .
a strategy change made a major part of transformation , with the execution in a higher gear to slow it , and it is easier to allow temp@@ o to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they went on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there are no better way to win this .
after triumph in 2012 on the page of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys there were hin@@ d@@ ding that he fell off the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ tions of England Riv@@ als .
for such a victory , this time there was no such problem .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of knowledge , it is in the realm of the possible that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a sacred date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that is equal to the Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
and he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there were more good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be staged on the second day of the competition at the Wig@@ gins with safety .
he had fought yesterday with Be@@ auf@@ tra@@ ded before the qualification , when the officials call him to measure his body size .
in the respective women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving his strong rail team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a score of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were down .
it &apos;s drama in the background , the resignation of the Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton technical director in April , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first night of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks completely after that , the legendary reputation , GB@@ S , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
the future of melting of Portland due to up@@ lifting of the energy application
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - stand on the game because the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract , and so that all delivery contracts will be announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a maximinum payout of the payout is scheduled for 20 years .
up to 2,000 work@@ places in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk at risk .
in addition , it could occur in dom@@ ino effects , as the melting ei uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to an closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland lost money and ris@@ ked an closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the power price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which covers the great aluminium mel@@ ts with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ino Valley , shared with it that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is in the majority owned by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p is smaller propor@@ tions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , meaning a further physical demand for electricity by the melting means , &quot; shared the company .
AG@@ L continued to continue that the treaties so @-@ called &quot; security transactions &quot; should have entered into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termination period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; so , AG@@ L therefore assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues , &quot; said the supply of electricity .
all potential impact on the proceeds on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong growth markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared with the value of contracts already written in its annual nominal amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the treaties , the &quot; ability of the &quot; ability ... to operate the melting of the melting or the power supply to the melting system . &quot;
the US company said that 2010 has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang that would have to come into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of explanation , why the contract has stepped down .
due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland , Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle .
at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said about 900 meg@@ awatts of electricity annually every year .
if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as power generators this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a kar@@ st of reality TV @-@ Star , B@@ ander@@ a is on the cover of September issue of V@@ ogue
San Antonio , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ger and the mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US V@@ ogue .
San Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers for weeping , &quot; wrote to San Antonio .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as well as in presence of the most popular show@@ c@@ z On@@ ders and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ ok , as well as it ends with a classic turn . they all have planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ ee@@ ee@@ ete plot almost every birthday of a children of children ( Se@@ ac@@ ay brought the sentence , &quot; You did that we would have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon girl on a Sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to take part in this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , the new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes her what the V@@ ogue Cover is concerned , ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were shown on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for himself .
the September edition is for V@@ ogue the most sold edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which is rather resem@@ bles a picture tape as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ements ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista was of the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ ver@@ stars will be e@@ ager@@ ly anticip@@ ating that in the past two years , pictures of the journal was still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
women who had already been on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda G@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; than &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
in 2013 Oscar @-@ Pre@@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 for the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - which is described by the journal as the &quot; perme@@ ating model &quot; of their generation - is it in good society .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous individuals or reality Stars or you@@ ths from today that know how to do a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is based on the denom@@ in@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women looking for themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years in their career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s role in the fashion world was always ob@@ sc@@ anned .
in June , the other Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague in Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called her &quot; the Mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these emotions came up again , when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but riding on the mist@@ ress seems to pass by the point .
Club J@@ enner is based on the cover of September issue of V@@ ogue .
it is in the most sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
she does public@@ ity for their Grun@@ er of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her ge@@ ared pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the journal LOVE .
and in their spare time she is to see TV in reality . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centres indicate annually 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s most recent acquis@@ itions are rejected annually by the municipal centres , while the industry had already been released on the effects of other central cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar arguments in their search for free legal advice and legal services .
legal services of the church , which are already over@@ utilized , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal agents .
the Director of the Municipal Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse and worse .
&quot; Queens@@ bor@@ ns Municipal centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families who have been dischar@@ ged by divi@@ ding workers - all these people have problems correct and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help you need .
the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of assistance needs to be forced out of Queensland with their legal problems without any help .
we call for the general public prosecutor and the Federal Minister as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these aver@@ ages , so that people need help to receive legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled her promise to raise funds for law@@ suits on the national average .
it is now at the time to look at the needs of the community centres and its customer communities , as well as that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before countries elections : SPD and CDU
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the gover@@ ning parties of the SPD and CDU .
this revealed representative p@@ olls of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely branch off in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue the government &apos;s government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just under the CDU , which could come back to 23 per cent again .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left hand came to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens are hes@@ itated for slightly losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again in the sever@@ ity landing day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented with 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD estimates that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU was only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent .
they are still behind the green with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left hand is 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss out in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came to the market .
today , the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite busy .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , which would be enough to submit a high resolution today for about two sel@@ ections .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came out exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the business and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros , fans can buy devices still in the internet , but they are somehow from the Stone Age .
20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer trade fair in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot of : SMS and emails , also by fax it was communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible with HTML browser , if possible , too slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found itself .
the price was very proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could happen in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone number of Finn@@ s experienced an example un@@ parall@@ eled disaster , was eventually sold and wrapped in Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ate providers , all of which later came to Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , in Samsung and Apple alone , alone 5@@ 55 million units .
global sales with the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company .
around the smartphone , a whole industry has been developed .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came to the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple boss announced Steve Jobs on the Mac World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a musical player , a phone and an internet communications , easy to use with touch screen .
Apple began the winner of Apple , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the re@@ viewing .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a self @-@ compreh@@ en@@ sible 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we need to learn all of the smartphone &apos;s smartphone , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board .
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England must manage the Olympic spirit and continue Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only going to take place in our local community and London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , as at that time in 2012 in London , when we managed to make sure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to achieve new possibilities for local and companies nearby Heath@@ row .
for our local communities alone , we will have 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and create youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the extension of Heath@@ row is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we are flo@@ or@@ ating on the world stage .
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heath@@ row answered each other question .
like the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is an option to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , to create £ 211 bn on the same growth and a legacy of skills and jobs in order to leave the airport as well as in whole GB .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion Swiss infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heath@@ row is also being one .
it is time that we turn these Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ oleum &quot;
for companies trying to earn money with On@@ line@@ advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle advertis@@ ements , a &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ oleum . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus would have decided that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his Des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the encoding concerning his public@@ ity to detect the indication of advertis@@ ements in which part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post wrote the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle is already underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has settled in the fight is a strong indi@@ ces for the industry , such as wor@@ r@@ ying advertis@@ ers for the industry .
according to a survey conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are using sco@@ ot@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , which access Facebook about their mobile devices , hand @-@ advertising is 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company has shown on display recor@@ ders on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , a speaker with .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of income , so Facebook has the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that it would be &quot; ad pre@@ ference ool &quot; to update the people more control over they have denied advertising .
on Thursday Facebook claims that No@@ blo@@ wers would be wor@@ r@@ ying on the site because they would block content on the side , which are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

woman , suspected of suicide on the Swiss Highway
the sacrifice was at the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman took part in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected hom@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police in Wa@@ adt spoke .
it &apos;s obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
it passed away on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , said the police to report these as well as any witnesses of the incident .
it was opened an investigation proceedings , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter gave the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers are displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be drawn up to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - a person in the dark on the motorway ran - was decided that the drivers have to go out at the highway that a pedestri@@ ans run in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acquitted of the neg@@ ligence , after having over@@ ride a man and killed a man on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice was drunk and has become un@@ conscious on the street .
the court ruled that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- that had answered on a justified kind -- on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report at the Police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past the Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble from climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could be derived from the same conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still slowly revol@@ ved .
the model also illuminated top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet proved to be more dry areas than de earth , but had once enough water and geograph@@ ic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and sh@@ ook up to faster ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ elled its day side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; says G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this heated the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella , to absorb the surface of a bulk of the sun heat .
the results are average temperatures , which are a few degrees of cooler than the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , which is similar to evolution that was previously presum@@ ed by Planet@@ en@@ ians .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a significant participation in the decision making of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately seek after a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years , I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations for Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and identification , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy has been in a statement .
in the course of summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
it must also have a co @-@ determin@@ ing right of decisions which influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; Sak@@ ic said .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season in the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was awarded as the winner of Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the late season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches signed a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal , and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers again take talks on , put on strike
the labour strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration of the North Sea workers are exposed to set up all the parties for a new talk round at the table , said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally based on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the in@@ ite and r@@ ities trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current track , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will hold a few day @-@ day sessions coming next weeks to start the beginning next year to re@@ use the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
in this year , Wood Group applied the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company accounts for a 10 @-@ percent decline in on@@ shore @-@ contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and plans to vac@@ ate his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alized as a result of its mega @-@ contrac@@ tors with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are located due to lower raw oil prices under pressure , a economic situation that had been intensi@@ fied by the British &apos;s decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliamentary member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the largest employers in the North Sea since one generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ation rate of stars in star@@ vation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler space teles@@ cope has helped ast@@ o@@ uns to collect the complete catalogue of rotation @-@ ups under the stars of the observ@@ atories .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers , why stars are rotating in the star cluster , as well as in which connection of the rot@@ ational periods of the planet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which emerged about 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they now turn the fastest .
to top rot@@ ational rates , these mature stars meet large amounts of star winds .
because these winds go through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ fed , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each constellation , taking the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star@@ vation -- like sun@@ spots -- recognis@@ es .
the latest catalog of rotation rates shows that massive stars slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes turning as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while against faster rot@@ ors , to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare the qualities of rotation rates .
&quot; the tro@@ ugh of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
we would like to learn more about how , when the How , when and Why stars slow down their rot@@ ations , so to speak to their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
the rebel and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the pipes of the Ple@@ k@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star starting from

after his emotional return , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will bear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants of major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated .
three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature is under a tenth deal of seasonal contract annually , 27 million US dollars annually .
by the end of the contradiction on December 31 , 2017 , he acted as a consultant and youth coach - at full content .
as player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .

know : because of a positive D@@ oping sample , weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can &apos;t start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overs@@ ha@@ dowed by the first official d@@ oping waste .
a ignor@@ ant ath@@ lete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day the first official d@@ oping in Rio de Janeiro have become known .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positive and excluded - immediately before the onset of the Ath@@ le@@ tics Ath@@ le@@ tics competition , these messages come to the un@@ time .
last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been detected last Sunday that is used as a m@@ asked agent for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ zen .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final above 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have had to take part over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of ch@@ en full co @-@ operation in the study , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will be working with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history is not the IOC , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of sport@@ s@@ men with positive results .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive itself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; stated the ath@@ lete &apos;s ath@@ lete .
according to the report , it is intended to act with the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood @-@ related substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa suspended provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B sample is to be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow addressed immediately with criticism of the ath@@ lete &apos;s ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t pull the right sli@@ ps , &quot; he said , &quot; We have Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
for instance , all the weight of the weight of the chronic d@@ oping resi@@ ding nation can not be held in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known in the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both contrac@@ ted the in@@ gest@@ ion , but they are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
prior to the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is a further serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic op@@ pl@@ ings in the start , the L@@ äu@@ fern@@ al Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition to the swimming pool , the former verses in China had also been su@@ ck@@ led between athletes and athletes .
the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ on purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m , I will be handed over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
in addition , Sun stood at the heart of a meditation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping cou@@ ter , &quot; said this .

Dat@@ enk@@ lau : fi@@ fi@@ de @-@ presses H@@ acker their sol@@ ving
programm@@ ers of stress @-@ Malware currently attack targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware Ab@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once more , partly several victims of a attack with press@@ ors software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of the companies have already been the goal of a Ran@@ som@@ ware comp@@ ress@@ age .
40 percent of the victims were willing to re@@ lie@@ ve the difficulty of solvents , to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their comp@@ ress@@ er software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company network .
if they are successful there , the potential sol@@ ving money is significantly higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the painters were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for itself .
only private users were the goal , but the change of company att@@ acking was frigh@@ tening fast in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a offering , they are looking for un@@ long changing files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encrypted the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the comp@@ ress@@ ers .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victim need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ tion Bit@@ coin - usually .
but where in private use the personal photo database on the game , it goes with companies to provide sensitive customer data or project data bases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage incur@@ red , if a Ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 per cent of the affected German firms generated net loss by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business activities completely , in a case there were people in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals victims were already threatened with attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; we say the victims always : does not pay , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult , in view of stand@@ still standing in operation , reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to establish a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researcher of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the comp@@ ress@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , make free accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and will be saved from a few hundred euros , companies must have to pay a hard negoti@@ ating and five @-@ digit sum to get their data un@@ key .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware comp@@ ress@@ ors the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
the more likely it is , however , that it is about three or four people .
the programmer sell their malware software then in the form of a software building , to the actual comp@@ ress@@ ors .
the existing malware kits were developed by the malware himself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of supply is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the comp@@ ress@@ ers are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one log@@ ins in one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software as possible as many PCs .
payment is done per in@@ correctly calcul@@ ator .
&quot; normally , the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explained Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better .
over 50 percent of the companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can hold back with file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful adoption , the perpet@@ rators will be explained instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explains .
this means the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is more than ever before .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators can now take entirely new goals in the internet of things on the grain .

one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use .
Honda everything is un@@ packing in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a bit cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved to be extremely flexible .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m heigh@@ ted HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely .
the materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant , just the cockpit @-@ top falling down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not only a trunk available from 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ assembled and 10@@ 26 l with fol@@ dable back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat rows of the back bench can be used as child chairs and provide a storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the charge height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to do something more qui@@ eter .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine for a further engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
in the tested Top @-@ Version &quot; Executive &quot; equipment , the equipment can be desired .
the City @-@ emergency braking system is part of the City @-@ emergency assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision system and the track support assistant .
the coll@@ ision prevention sometimes irrit@@ ated because he rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ent objects . &quot;
the remote control assistant works very reliable .
and the intelligent temp@@ o regul@@ ates re@@ acts to the transport recognition and imp@@ s@@ sel@@ t if required .
the full connectivity is only available for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI jack lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who want to invest so much will receive the gasoline unit from 20000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euros .
engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
Honda offers a versatile and versatile car with the HR @-@ V .
Air@@ line is not responsible : fall on flight passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is only conc@@ ei@@ vable in danger , which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Upper Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down the fall in the fall .
however , the accident would have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of living , so the court .
the airline had no damage to the man .
sickness : when paid the promot@@ er
after their journey there was only money back after their journey , when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
this is only the case , if more than ten per cent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ating case a family on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ oise were severely due to diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vomiting .
she spent almost all holiday in the rooms .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a faulty plumbing , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea water .
the family was the view , the journey was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
indeed , the cl@@ ots in fact was defective .
but the organizers only took some time before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go out until then , that sea@@ water was fine .
so he didn &apos;t hurt his information , so the verdict .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ urities were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by infectious one - belonged to a general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the violence against refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state had to discuss and decided to react to terror at the same time .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if off@@ ender would have to leave the country faster , however , the safety and strength also the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag .
he also announced another person@@ al rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in middle four @-@ digit size groups over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y advertising for terrorism has to be under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , which will be amended so quickly , especially the purchase of weapons in the Internet .
the last much discussed per@@ spiration for doctors is supposed to remain open after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to seek solutions , such as the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of mental ab@@ normal@@ ities .
in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support .
teachers have to be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning an investig@@ ator .
the SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , to contribute to the safety of security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior is clear against shareholders .
&quot; that was a ear@@ cher for the hing@@ es in the CDU / CS@@ U , Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ator ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double citizenship .
a general prohibition of authority , he content for constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t offer everything you reject , and I turned the wearing of Bur@@ ka .
talking about rules about rules about traffic or for witnesses .
green @-@ boss Simone Peter designed the minister to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages and in@@ ability to sim@@ ulate them .

better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it looked regularly on the road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal outlet is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in the con@@ gest@@ ion , when they drive through the motorway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road works extends on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right track down to 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then turn right from the Hammer street to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares early to advance , making the total flow on the much @-@ used section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea of an extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West Germany .
the tram stop on the Zu@@ br@@ inger annoying is the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days the back@@ rest is enough to reach the bridge over the Alber@@ Slovenian road and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on B 51 shortly before departure Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic will only be guided by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built nearly a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations revealed that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to absorb the heavy traffic of the heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that is constantly connected , the responsible state can &apos;t say .
however , it is possible to reck@@ on with years : because the bridge has an official rest of time up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal outlet , the state operation is deliberately chosen for the bu@@ si@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities .
the traffic will be guided on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
inter@@ cultural tour : cultural activities for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the boy theater are planning a musical project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s permits young people with a migration and refugee @-@ background , cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster .
in the context of &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years old visited the st@@ aging of the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with mig@@ rant and refugee intern@@ ally , schools with welcome classes , the opportunity to visit the project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people from the class were come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the scenic images and video animations it would have been possible to follow the course , so the news release of the boys Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ ying , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season of a musical the@@ atri@@ cal project .
from October to December , adolescents with and without escap@@ e- and migration background between 14 and 20 years have the ability to get professionally delivered courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ cal language placement are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association ends with many classes , who want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ing : hope on weather condition
the weather has made the shooting stars in south@@ western Germany in the southwest of Germany to Friday a st@@ rich by the bill - but there is hope .
the night was not suitable for clouds and rain to observe the heaven spectac@@ le , the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , was born on Friday mor@@ nings .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Pers@@ ei@@ ds that belong to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they are apparently coming from the constellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which proceeds in the Nor@@ theast .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , ever around , you wake up forever , at night you can &apos;t think far ahead of the wake @-@ up cl@@ adding anymore .
that is all other than relaxing .
after all , one of these problems is in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of the adult sleep problems and more than ten percent find their sleep often or permanently rather relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and they can under@@ take them various causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ert , board member of the German Society for Schla@@ it@@ enti@@ ation and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand in it , but the In@@ som@@ nia is never , so an input and sle@@ epl@@ ess disorder .
especially those who go through to sleep many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ on@@ ne@@ cht says the board member of the German Haus@@ physician association with practice in the Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors can also be used , but also medications .
not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is common with depression , &quot; says We@@ ert .
and it can be that various factors would require each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ red , about everyday problems and worry about , there is no example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I use sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week and is imp@@ aired on day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es the case .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or heada@@ ches .
in order to re@@ lie@@ ve the problems , it is important to find out of their causes .
as treatment options , including behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or medications - classic sle@@ epl@@ et@@ ers only occur in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ nets , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , are scar@@ ed in Germany .
this is why you should first contact sleeping difficulties at first at bed@@ time , advis@@ es the case .
it can clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for an investigation in sleep laboratory medicine , for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory trac@@ ts , in disease pre@@ ference , or if you do not find the cause of a sleep@@ y disorder , fi@@ xation is explained .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ nets .
after going down , one goes to the bed at its normal time .
in addition to electro@@ des on the body , one carrying a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a anten@@ nas on the finger .
in addition , a camera is drawn on the ceiling to sleep .
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of actu@@ ator , where you can apply for a better sleep .
note counts : regular sleep and rise times , not to sleep in bed , not to sleep in a bed , not watch TV to sleep , alcohol avoid and night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not eligible .
what the Dsch@@ el@@ dest camp with lack of medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself to the disap@@ pointing cut of the DS@@ V teams at Olympic Games by Facebook .
in December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first time in Doha and exhibited his first world record at the same time .
the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Mark D@@ ei@@ bler has put himself in his criticism of the ex @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where a Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig 150.000 € should not be surprised by missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday at his Facebook page .
the feed system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control is very good .
we can not compete with countries that promote very much , and don &apos;t even want to see the topic of d@@ oping or even run it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be stopped , &quot; he explained further .
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how you should hold it with countries .
&quot; if you can not have a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent control rooms of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A can not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , which has now an ice di@@ ele .
airport : gang of luggage arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the civilian population of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had committed several t@@ ash@@ - and carrier steels as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock the civil servants of the airport of Düsseldorf , a gang returned which was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ phins since mid @-@ July and were gener@@ alized , labour and particularly professional .
the specialists of crimin@@ als ab@@ dic@@ ate 34 can prove the thi@@ eves , which have traveled to Germany , four acts of crimes .
they caught a total of more than 15.000 euros .
Alt@@ constructions , a few lenti@@ ls , in between still a rest of the corn@@ erst@@ one : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
go along the street from the east to the west , one comes along with play@@ grounds , a fresh@@ er kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite to a Li@@ dl which will soon be demolished , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments are supposed to be built here .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls in the last weeks , however , preferred with burning cars .
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of the rental income , on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , since the beginning of the year , the police viol@@ ated several occasions the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rol with 30 to 40 officers and three teams in front of the spot , closed parts of the road and kept visitors from it to enter the house with number 94 .
during the renovated building worker in the order of unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved among the youth from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer morning the road appears peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sitting on the pav@@ ement before the houses in the sun , others are talking about late .
in the immediate vicinity of the laboratory projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer who lives in the Kie@@ z , and J@@ ana * , who draws up here three children , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the bon@@ ding projects , they share the concern from rising ten@@ ds and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound after a Kie@@ z , who wished for a majority of pol@@ itic protection against v@@ andal@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police take up their neighbours , obviously not exists .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which is now in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and risk of poverty .
also houses and the native residential projects belong to the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , many houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic , including almost the whole main@@ frame road , close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under large police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alised in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people today , which they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become mag@@ nets for tourists and election lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them , citizens from GDR and former home network share their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the ten@@ dencies , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er will be attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them in the bor@@ dered discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown at d@@ warf .
no other street was mentioned in this year so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that not all neighbours should be regarded as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against police officers .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make non@@ damage , ten@@ dencies rather to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for k@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rental house next to the disputed 94 years , cannot be a speech of un@@ certainty .
as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that are not intended for this .
even the famous burning cars make it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
for the architect architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives along the street and gets more each other with , than somewhere else . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Street and stayed .
this is why it was so important that the residents got their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take them away : due to un@@ predic@@ tive new buildings in former builders , which viol@@ ates the old residents .
&quot; these are the property apartments , which are not interesting for many here - live here rather people who are not so well done , &quot; she says .
&quot; violence and destruction is absolutely not thei@@ sted . &quot;
but what to do if one never stops someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even in the police and the inhabitants .
for zo@@ omed people who were interested in colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the left projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who move , should be aware of that - just like someone who attracts a bar in a pub , can be compl@@ ain about noise .
all members only presented with pre @-@ sur@@ names have to be called , not named with their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organ@@ izer .
besides , she is a social worker .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
social educational in support the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , Refu@@ ge@@ es , Refu@@ ge@@ es , Auth@@ orities , Auth@@ orities and Every@@ one else .
Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the ei@@ ving wool mil@@ der , which has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cked than rather on the multitude of wanted areas - meant - meant to write the position as the administration .
a administration of administrative with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous wool of wool .
however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le means .
especially , it is about organisation , working with people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it satis@@ fies a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was the t@@ allest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ en- and full official actors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon , new container are available in the Was@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been a serious problem since some time , flats have been recognized for connecting flights .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must under@@ take the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility is changing from the Coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work so far , whether you need to rely on private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore gener@@ alized apartments must be made , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are positioned in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments , it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , training courses , one @-@ Euro jobs and aid workers for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do @-@ profit activities - and motivated and very tidy , how Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the job for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
it does not mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a belonging feeling .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so you can jump up here and hon@@ esty .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it will take time and they can make time make sense to bridges , for example with language courses .
those who feel the feeling , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , should not work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never in@@ corporate itself .
the significant majority was motivated .
problem cases also exist , &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this was already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a tough question : did the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher n@@ ai@@ v may call it . &quot; a residual risk could not exclu@@ de it , but would not exclu@@ de it .
but the hel@@ pers are sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are also the topic of refugees .
they were afraid that the attacks bring them completely into exile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and hon@@ esty of the site and in the region have to look out .
in doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants may come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
this question is clearly to answer , the policies are afraid .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher was also well @-@ employed to integrate the previous people reasonable .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women are embar@@ rass@@ ing .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
chim@@ ney : sought bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter
the police helicopter flew around one hour long , different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are violent in a flat @-@ detached house near 8.@@ 50 a.m. to an apartment in a multi @-@ family house .
the residents surprised the two , and struck the in@@ hol@@ den into the escape .
the two men were 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably m@@ asked for both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis .
they fled downtown .
the police replaced several strike @-@ wings as well as a police helicopter .
the flag@@ ging was without success .
perhaps the unknown in fact fell close to the apartment or in their escape .
