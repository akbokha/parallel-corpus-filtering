<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that's both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential applicants, however, are at tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against the state of the economy - with taxes and regulatory systems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to give the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be completely different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will return regulators massively, and he makes himself strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax sets - for individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, however, says: the state has certain duties to open, he has to open the disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the wealthy would be increased, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the theme of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">It must be invested in that, say Trump and Clinton almost wortate.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are rejected by the state-critical Teachy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, there could be no party discussions on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and will return to the US coal extraction in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement wants to be announced.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast, Clinton wants to expand its investment programme explicitly to expand the renewable energies and demands: "a country will create the superpower of the clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with infrastructure and international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, would both don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">But at the same time both the U.S. don't want to isolate themselves from international trade - just as just American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, called Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars was a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must fall, then he says he might not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the next months is probably likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one hand, Trump, who wants to withdraw the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him, so that the budget deficit would only be larger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least of the wealthy wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every escape woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are fleeing alone, almost in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When arriving in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in the arm.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene acts normally.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the division's leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria, and deals with the theme of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fledged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north, one of the few decentralized accommodations for allashed women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs made up the facility with Pro Familia and the Munich women's help.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatening torture or death, or because their families send them as a hope of hope to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, other reasons for the escape: "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forcible, honorable, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">It continues to drive them.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the tugs for example, for example, demand a sexual action for example, is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that, as soon as they are in Germany, Bahr tells us.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, women in refugees would often be regarded as minderful and worse in refugee camps.</seg>
<seg id="32">This also causes some 90 percent of women who live in the Munich Region, traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar, that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or do not trust itself to speak openly about the living, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not help to assist, there are more accommodations for them, calls for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, seven district governments are responsible for the refugees of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they are wishing from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and in the Oberfranken, there are not something in accomodations of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, women are not separately accommodated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press writing of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the Upper Bavaria, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are apartments in some communal floors or houses only for women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and equality of the sexes" in the European Parliament calls for women to be placed separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the Committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women are separated."</seg>
<seg id="45">"lacks privacy or are men and women together, it is possible to donate - forcing violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separated and accessible to women easily, stands in the study.</seg>

<seg id="4">The JDC said that it failed ministers to proceed to the concerns concerning the contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of external sideers"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce his hands and an official end of the eight-month war of the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterplayers in a gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot destroy the impression that Ankara wants to be the propitiation of most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handsome, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared narrowly and he barely radiated heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper that Erdogan would have been so benevolent than would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed to signify the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin, which showed that the government of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mention what he mentioned in his execution: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow from reaction to the time was wutentannt.</seg>
<seg id="15">He told Putin and accused Ankara to be back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The case was even greater, as it was celebrated by a missed boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetrong is going to build up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media conducted an enormous attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed, the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the serious, the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogans would benefit from illegal oil trading in Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was awarded the President Erdogan to apologize, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all the friends who he can get after he was enthroned almost his amtes coup during the last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">He repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey too.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights, which usually takes several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attraction on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television offered fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this: "tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious toward the West, as it was a response to those who tried to overtake power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persistent Groll come across the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - which is weakened out of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russian President won a bonus for ensuring that he demanded a coup d'etat after the attempted coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is true for Moscow, a self-comprehension that himself has a profound fear of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit at this glorious palace allowed Russia and Turkey allowed it to represent an analyst by an analyst, "Alliance of foreign visitors": two countries that embarked off from the West and to feel poorly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are always large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be noted that after almost three hours of first-chats, both presidents at the press conference said that they did not even strive the theme.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey rushed to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to refute this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus, where common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of fine hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member Turkey lost the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state may talk at least again.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Bank has since distanced itself since then, when she had almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this time, "RBS" brand features have been used to protect other final consumer brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported international sports with millions of pounds to Sponsoring, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she decided to focus more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>

<seg id="11">Ulster Bank's brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>

<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the RSB brand will be part of our investment brand as well as the brand, under which our employees will be busy as we now become more to a bank of brands."</seg>

<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already told that his six Nations sponsorship will no longer run and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop at the bench of brands, as we are looking inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Board of Staff.</seg>

<seg id="8">I am very emotional, because my family is also here</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy that it happened on Newmarket, because I landed here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it is a banaler Friday evening with 20,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes up the cheers when he catches the victory.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two jockeys reached a milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record breaking career.</seg>

<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma thrilled fans since years for this sport.</seg>

<seg id="23">It was annoying.</seg>
<seg id="24">A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "glorious seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six months of Sperre, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubts and to return to its top shape.</seg>

<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the renowned Public Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is (in Russian) that he was later the principal officer and leader of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin on his appointment, "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state, and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the narrowest confidangling Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But in spite of the ridicularity for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, here is the sequence of a kind of power fight?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environment policy - pushed into big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are cited on the website of Kremlin, Ivanov said "It's true that I've asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - advertise posts four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessicherhood (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of Putin would have cast off the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken from another, near ally Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister, before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensmark Crossings with the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closing of the "ceiling fan," which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, and 46 ropes parts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">The farm, Keith Brown, visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historical and symbolic moment at the building of Queensoldressings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, it is the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck a finicky activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of all brücking- decks on their place and the final section of the deck receives a betonguss for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to his seat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first clasp represents a considerable milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of the closure and civil engineering is visible.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installation of the last street plane and its connection with the expansion of the north-deck, we had to then close the existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling of the northern road bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very finicky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Green said: investors should be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments during the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "hand-concept living" for the next term.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first line it's about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A rule is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD-Group President Christoph Bratmann says: "we're on the Green Party: those who want to build urban areas must be able to provide 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments are, however, can be created in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the large extent of the town hall was, however, "Bratmann:" how are investors wanting to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to have investors on such surfaces at least 10 per cent, but as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing programme, which will cost millions of cost, will need to be paid for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so violently said: "there is no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make a few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left will still want to make hardness requirements for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of his, so violently, there is a deepening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the management administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet come: because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how would you like to reduce the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments, which will run out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">The year 2020 alone will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, so the planned spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city now.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, apartments should have to be thought back into the price binding again.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the West.</seg>
<seg id="26">In one blow, the problem may be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt run the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be found there back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we don't want to leave the owners, housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">As a result, the number of social dwellings in the western city is drastically increased, the target of the so-called mixing-mix.</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social guards in just a few districts should not give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are expecting to put it in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Leader Holger Herlitschke writes: "for a broad majority, the CDU joins the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have focused on more building sites for family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, which pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, as the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child will no longer walk outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, on screens, has been complained about many times during the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go it's about to get people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen at the screen was initially restricted to TV, video games, and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and activities will not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I prefer, of course, on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app that were created on the characters which were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later there was a drawing series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within less days, Pokémon Go more users than the Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smartphones go outside and searching for Pokémons who have been traced with a GPS once they were once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the calf and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in increments which returns the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, a app for Apple Watch, followed by the Washington Post that followed by two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed every day 30 minutes, who jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase its performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public explaining campaigns for health, people want to take "30 minutes" to come to "" "from the sofa," and "every day to be active" beat on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people coming up.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports may not be evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives regularly, reduces its chances of becoming cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to perform it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also mürrical gamblers who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if you could follow smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons, there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a tour, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="2">That is what I present among women's olymers in the gymnastics, and that is out of more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with every Sommerolympiade since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turbulences, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Katholics in is abrasive, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This crew finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one of the female Turists a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they were unexpected, but mastery Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold for women with an individual campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Man member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but I do not see gym classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team is only four trumpet in the team. furthermore, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turns will unite the expensive sport and Turner first line in private gymnasium who will maintain their parents "training, setup, travel clothing, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and families). the list may continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gyms are in wealthy suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, Turner will receive their entire training and this is for families a expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have trained both of their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the congregations of Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more powerful and easy-to-accessible gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gyroud of 20 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1">Travelogue Ian Wright schabt for a guide for his tongue to the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undernourished his immune system and appreciation of a serious examination - by blocking some of the dirty and ecarrests places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel guide Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk chased his course on a Euro-donation, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a rinse head of a separate toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving any object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and let us see what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," a few surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, sling the push button of a pulling toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may really be shockered, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about promoting intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left out what he stretched, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of its intestines, traveled by the world and ate unique and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to disharches of toilets, the task indicated his immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "already as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I put all things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was justified by his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proofs showed a luminance number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminance number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to block after their Luminometry rate was over 4000 units, while fresh-washed hands have a little less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel guide "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterium number in different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film, he says: "this is the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet, close."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt better than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">There is nothing here, because it is inside here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valid Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating about to look and simultaneously explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorings by allowing that we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday life, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and the documentary we could provide for more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film director, added: "let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he thought some of the things I have to leaky, like the ekelian Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to lead them, and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by validation of 84 percent of all respondents, lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, said they have at least occasionally use products which included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she was unable to repair the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="8">She said, "It was for people here an absolute nightmare and I am the view that people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider because this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons, who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had added, street fights with bases, abuse of investors, drug abuse, drug dealers and excessive screams, spreading and flukes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, was an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that will be demolished under circumstances, old trash was found.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden benches were intimidated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street, and the police had to be called regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner this week violent by the property after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteered.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation of lightened neighbours were cheered, they said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">One said: "they were not ashamed."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"today we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not familiar!</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the wintered side of the municipal house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that it abdicts the tenant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delogation is always the last step, the Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">That was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extremely bright and had to be terrible for her neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community that have courageous to us and have made us the information we have done.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will donate a lot of neighbours and conveys the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="36">She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon was, who came into a car accident in 2013.</seg>

<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernsteins's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older called Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her loving kindness with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinates me.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy Parliament decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">But as far as it is not until now, summer holidays, heat and day wrestling fight - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who should be persuaded by the election struggles, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most vacationers who are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are no locals, so do not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to this, practical problems come: in the holidays, the posters hang on posters, balloons flyers, flyers and put off the end voices, only labeling.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass just under the people over.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU Coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting, as strongly neuling AfD cuts and what remains remaining at the end of the coalition range.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and has been head of government since 2008, makes an almost unremarkable campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and churks a little with the people, as it did already his most legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and is Chancellor Merkel relied the guilt of AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their refugee policy, you "We create" the rise of populists will be accelerated, which will probably cost the beautiful office.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading edge data, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has seen how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has conceived twice chancellor Angela Merkel to large explorations; Merkel's Bundestag is located in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxda as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to Germany's other corners, Angela Merkel refuses to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeast CDU renounces largely on the usual campaign conditions on market grounds and shopping malls with sunshades and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, therefore, Kokert, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country you have brushed out the basis that they must be very strict to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are here like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the times of the country there is hardly anything.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the council of the CDU election fighting Kokert to his fellow soldier is, however, self-relief: "you have to go there where it is waging, namely where people are waking: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, any birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD gained a clear 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, Small party with seven percent in the polls, would have to create the jump into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the holiday-emergency and lay their election campaign to change the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign" call it the national president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise there are green election fighting on track ensues after local stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidacin, curvt straight with a house boat through the Mecklenburg-river lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed, with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction of the construction, starting at 5.30 o'clock in the morning and only at 20 o'clock, there is sole praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the end of October, until the end of October, all will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">Blessed is also the punishment of those responsible for the construction works, about when it comes to the establishment of heating drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">From the construction site on Monday to the south, and also the locking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg, the traffic situation in the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now move from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Different traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says the Chief Executive Officer Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The native of Bach's street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many bleaches sought after and rather their Navi trusted as the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, what led to other trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As well as the speed limes were not kept, the church reinforced the measuring vehicle from Mössing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant beliefs," says King, who made yourself a spot on the location.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute has been littered.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was at 77 km / hour in the speed-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">But since the construction site has gone on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg, the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the cards, businessmen don't want to look like.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B-27 sanitation has led with them to sales, everybody asks you to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have to do with the "end client" has less to do so for other companies, which has barely any consequences for the development.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "most light decline," but also a fact that of course, "the running of course is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">On the strongest ones are the local along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds distinct words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all guest rooms have hit it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">They were missing the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro.</seg>
<seg id="32">In order to increase sales, the sales were over 50 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="33">Road plans have been put into operation "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half were dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Mr. Jörg Schmidt is on a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the note that the restaurant had benefited from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now she also has to carry the disadvantages that arise through the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all sounds, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will pass on.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, family enterprise has been settled here since 1715, which he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now because of the complicated traffic control less frequently, it can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot drive, it is also very nice anyway.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his genealogy after the end of the sanitation work returns, Göhner has no doubts.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 works on its customers for the largest crisis which has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly smoking in the name of terror attacks on laws.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to recent proposals, Interior Minister de Maizière is now entering a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a Dulce status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner tell all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconcner.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals were contrary to the coalition partner "politically," says the Federal Minister of Justice at the presentation of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are demanding to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also participated in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the Minister of Interior, however, was placed on results and at a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière presented a little time before he presents his conclusions to the security in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But now they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot is already known, announced, pondering: that a new safety authority to encode your communication encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and arms.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call to more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">For part, de Maizière will start a second run for proposals that have not been to do with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for counter groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"these are difficult points for the SPD," dreamed of the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He still hold this nevertheless for reasonable and demanding anything, which has no opportunities in the coalition partner.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas showcases de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partially in itself: it plans fast procedure for shifts and more possibilities for the detention of people prior to deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees that will be picked up into the country should be submitted to their smartphones and submit social media account for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">At Dulce for expired asylum seekers, he wants some more worse than so far - such as those who walk crimes or their papers have to throw away their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legally.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also seems unbalanced and can be asked questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - at the unequal treatment of thought, for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not obvious to say that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people in view of the high number of refugees are concerned about safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that have undergone the human beings, now did not leave the campaign in election times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">Safeguarding is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly difficult at the topic of inner security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past days it went up between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garrisky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then concerning a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the Ressortees also demand a burka ban and demand a conversion from double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also working here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from a double-pass, he doesn't hold anything.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">You can reconsider, be not sensible.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in a Burka prohibition, he had constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is constitutionally unsolid, and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner, it must still be demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is a lot in it, which could take care of dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, the SPD is currently trying to profiling himself in the topic of inner security.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party director Sigmar Gabriel indicated a cautious conversation and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything, to contribute to the safety of security."</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel fuel, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But not in all markets it runs round.</seg>
<seg id="4">With the response reaction there are vertebrae to a term.</seg>
<seg id="5">Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite its many brands, Europe's biggest car park, Europe can continue a further increase in spite of the diesel engines thanks to its many brands and a few more-run markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand VW was weaker especially in Western Europe and resisted the overall sales, as that in the Dax has recorded business.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the brand was sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, China is the second most important market, sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market Germany, the deliveries were almost a sixth of sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Marking Chief of Chief Jürgen Stackmann, the weaker numbers in July were back on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, it has been given a change in some core markets by "changing economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote for the exit from the EU, explained a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, where the emission of exhaust first escalated, there is also a minus to beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the government's mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue to increase the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only 0.9 per cent of vehicles can be reduced to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group Chief of Staff Fred Kappler was further ongoing from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period, 5,904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million wagons to rearmament into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of rearmament, VW decided that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After changing the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">The car of the customer, according to the conversion of a "guaranteed" certificate, but don't speak of a "guarantee" as it was on Friday in the company's business.</seg>
<seg id="24">Reason to be legal experts.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">These were confirmed by VW-representatives in the federal state ministry last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has the requirements of my Inquiry Commission and to fulfill its full-duty team." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations of these are not accepted," Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken over the guarantee that, with fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after changing no deteriorations, and all the relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was in the table.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers may come to a workshop about half a year after the conversion, with a engine damage to a garage, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also, in customer interest, it is important to avoid that in case of some other damages, which have nothing to do with the gobscandal that comes with no safeguarding regarding possible warranty regulations, as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, VW is not using the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely adult males love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hastened to the commendations to overseer him under the pseudonym of non-aging defects, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplication of sound plates is not on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the realism of physical objects, but due to Midlife Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a plate, are all of the foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather than (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of Yougv?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, before I stand up, my hands hold and something to decide: "so, let's take a close look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos are slowly taxed to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there is a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, the I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men mean age) into Reckless Records (data: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20) follow, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not have followed him at home), dressing the walls of his home.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy records, which he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared as I was 11 or 12. things I thought to be too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy records, rather introverted, and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I smoke not and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets he meets the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhy, people who have heard about the comeback and let us see again their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually have disagreeable about 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of followers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to recognize that record business offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older clients participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of confidently sound disc, of objects, the happy cheesderations.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void, or possession of material possessions to be a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector, and I think it's so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered a employee from a turnout stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use while 7% of those who buy a plate, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I blamed through a stack to Bossa Nova compilation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data: three men of middle ages), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revič.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone arrived recently here and said:" I have no record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate, so that I can put it into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musical loads.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who come only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an empty audience when I go to clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizer- and sextant Pop instead of experimental jazz drones from the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity in the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks particularly lonely, but brand psychic traumata are hard to be determined if one stands for about 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes, watching the Varietes for sale on sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a shovel-starred than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, therefore, records of records are not real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to any other way, but the beauty of records is... it drives with a loved epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit the jeans to master Jeans-Hotpants, I watch a group of young Teenagers, who is grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them on - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, even the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my investigations were revealed that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in turntables in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers exist, which exist in reality, turntables, and onlineages.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security, not with the bummets by record shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they face the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator that rises over the shoulders of nothing more impressive men of middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at a rupting stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated by a result of 43-7 in the Dealer stage, here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji the master class in the handling, side-stepping, descending, line-run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was reconciled by the not too bad consolation prize of silver medal - Great Britain fourth this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in semi-final on the same day could drop to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji had a 15-man team in their shape.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it's probably not - that at least a bridge will be a gold medal at his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">She lost eight years ago under Ryan any game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They only lost one here.</seg>
<seg id="11">This sleek will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and released the GBS attacks from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when one would run in driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to top, when Osea Kolinisau retired in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">In four minutes later, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly has the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A heptive Tackle of Mitchell stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch-down and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new tour since the restart and there was still over a minute season... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prepped through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB still had to be seeded.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time by and completed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went straight after a brilliant play-play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was running for a long time in favor of the South Korean, whose fans sang, feways and danced at the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame won the i-pond with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fififf heard that Fijis hugged and GB kiciled were defeated in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the days, Fiji had defeated Japan in semifinals with 20-5 defeats and Britain pressed South Africa in a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half into the front, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive footwork and achieved a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-side teams, secured the profit and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no engine gold than with these games, and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing machine to the last, 220 tough Hieve, who enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only the applets that sat at the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was always present at the second Olympic champion in a row without tax wife, the first women in the history of the British sport that laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, at least her 39.ter unprotected use, which is also an exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athlettering, which reflects on the surface with the elegance of goings, which does not reflect the type of the Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing, a battalion consented to content that make the difference and there was no more helpless than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed this day when cancer was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, the operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, he spreads anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start what was the interruption to a minimum, if that is the correct term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the infirmity of victory there went their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a annoying morning so much more than anything else and thus trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, which was as captain in the Royal artillery regiment in a use in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much me this means, how much I and Helen and Robin worked together.</seg>
<seg id="23">Three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for coaching or better trainers.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were really caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of itself.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not able to do some Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to have no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take place for a year before making decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, health: to sing elderly people</seg>
<seg id="2">The Singen has accompanied her whole life: as a young woman she was in the school choir, in the teaching position she took the subject of music, and today the 78 year old sings in a senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physically," she describes them.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, they do something good in their health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is equal to several perspectives: a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, describing Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular occurrence, senior contacts can slip and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures solve in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: to arrange and organise themselves on the others, and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of collage. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="12">For there are seniors a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly calls his lungs, is not so fast in everyday life as fast as the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it comes to obtain the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labor Community of the Seniors organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint Singen had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or hearing of songs in elderly people are wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and particularly melodies, people were exiled to themselves for a long time-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrating on the own voice and on a given rhythm, to adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone, do not just want to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one drives through singing in the choir, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I have long for something, I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 sinking people, who sounds like a tone beside it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Searching for the suitable offer, seniors various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the most famous circle in a senior fennel, one can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internet access.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should necessarily be connected to a choir, advises hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something free - this is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensibel over the races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it enables snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already weird to the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform themselves into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from an Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are inconspicuous, independent high-quality tools that generate more than 30 million selects per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misentries arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused of being able to propagate Blackface or white skin than beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When they proposed a filter for some Users, who gave them slums, false teeth and untouched, some critics have known a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowing."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repeated controversy fell on a larger problem that the company has diversatility.</seg>
<seg id="10">The messages and the indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat hasted that it would have been disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as homage to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outside that have experienced racism, the filter reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose Tweet were widespread over the photos that the filter "infringing and the least was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counterpart of a very conflicting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowing of yellow was dragged into.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolperdrabee.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment that we all keep in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are in race as their older minors - could not be expected to expect lowering sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats felt a picture created for a user, so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineers, decided to erase the Snapchat account, others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a set of medium and in a phone interview they said that they believe that racial-related controversy surfaced a lack of diversatility with snapshots in the Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the big part white, only male leaders and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DelTerSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they are safe or feel good to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat has mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on diversatility of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military operations of the United States Central Command changed more detailed information to draw an optimal-scale picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it permits the actual states of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the republican Committee, intelligence service Committee and military budgetary, reported by great discontent among Central Command intelligence intelligence, reported as before their assessments on the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"News Services, which were typically sent by high-level CentCom Commander, regularly published a positive image of the American efforts to terrorism as the actual states on site permits and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article in the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">CentCom managers range up to the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detail-resistant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government officials submitted by Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts predict the pressure from their prelaws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015 many Central Command Press releases, assumptions and statements made clearly more positive than the fact" presented the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom was publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much clearly." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Kansas, in a opinion.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the points of Central Command changed the detailed reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while investigations will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports are underway in the Ministry of Defence Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news services published on Thursday their own findings, which agree with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>

<seg id="20">This process, such as Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of subsequent reports," the morals under analysts and "gave up a little space for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no evidence of a intervention of the White House with CentCom analysts on a certain political opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the Congress was published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times posted an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspectorate, which were admitted to complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press writing of the Pentagon, gave in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports during the investigations of the General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also gave that "experts sometimes have consistently demonstrating opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence is a controversial discussion of this important topics of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigation have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year, however, have raised the question to the Central Command in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions for the last year.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the obedience information concerning the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when an CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, was contrary to the recommendations of many analysts at the recommendations of many analysts at the end of many analysts and a little time on the wall of making thoughts about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led Mr. Hooker to specialise government officials, that contrary to the statements of the Government of the terrorist government, there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group since this provisional refineries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this discovery was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damalous commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative Assembly on a hearing before the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey murderer in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as they did not qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team worked everything.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig parnham, a Englishman, coach of the National Team and thereby began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working horse in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can rip the rest completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torrigen in the first half of the game with a backdrop out of the seam.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the player from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It took a Sprint with a flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the centre and luded the ball into the gate to bring the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games so far.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro's events feel stable and unavoidable, a treading relay between competition and streams.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is to protect the swimmers from the wristband to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch to the TV, reading a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the queue in Coffeshop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples, would have definitely be sent among these known names that could be sent to Prime Time, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even fenders.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not illuminated any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade there are sports that are not generally accepted: air pistons, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming, and may know it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I expect a modest arguments for my specific love, then you can turn the attention to the discreet charm of the Trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the Trampolinjump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made its debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years so much that many of whom I asked, did not know that at all there is a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and won a athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Trampolinjump has a certain external secular charm, partly because it sounds for the unclarified ear for a Clownsschule than those that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bad enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonary tremors of his never to end crush - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from Spanish El trampoline, which means so much means "jump board."</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and must have a row of falling motions (turning, hreal and saltos) before they landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed by the official Olympiad program according to design, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists hoping to continue in their striving after gold, faster, upwards and penetrate, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes and back, upward and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the television transference also another cavity: the world or the Olympiarecords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted Streets is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel even while watching these games as something tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of that, the trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or her pruning, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes down, then down, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant rising of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final stages of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC Announces Endrunden as part of an afternoon block at two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overseen in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be reached by the attack and objecfication of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal in front of recently - Mr Dooley expects his to air to air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a member of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, the political changes in Ethiopia, struggled to violent opposition in the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that they were killed during clashes during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking them?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid convoy of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country, and continued to spread more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people invaded the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer, according to human rights organisations, was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen were shot and killed on unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, the videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals hit young people with shocks, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands an incoming examination now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and will continue to be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, particularly in Somalia. only few countries in Africa when at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expands in considerable tempo.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, dissenters were effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were put into exile, or put into prison, or driven into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these have no other options except protests, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land using to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a major criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these tender, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fears that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced out more or less forced out of turbulence in recent years and could arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness gets explode under the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate about internet proxies that hide, where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians reported that they were so protested to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not a natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Etons, the Amharas, which mainly are predominantly Christian high-countries, are in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfair by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for about 6 percent of the population and the military, in the intelligence services, in trade and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a non-known disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly recompensated in it to perceive early signs of discontent and to use special agent to make opponents and make them immense.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Mr Abdi," said Mr. Abdi, is missing a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively uncautious reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst that it does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after that thousands were protesting against elections, which were apparently pursued by the Government, and subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razcien many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning, as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestants attacked Gondar, a amharic city, owned by Tigray, and the hatred for the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies in a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently noted that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to interact together in a volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin crash."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains its assertion Obama had founded ISIS is "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by removing his multi-repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder of the Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions regarding communication skills of the Republicans, whether in the position to communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his Mitstreites, who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain to the actual position, which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the allegations on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump in relation to the claim on Thursday went back and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump, he is just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican Presidential candidate wanted nothing to know of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of critique on Mr. Trump descends, while he tries the focus of his campaign due to falling downfall values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already put sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July, he withdrew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should give Mrs. Clint's emails, but later, "Of course I thought that" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic limits in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test like certain messages of its fans, as they arrive, and then," clarify "according to what the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who watches the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rather than punishing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted a more corrosive sound, because its remotions are further decreased.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a major lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head-racing in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provokement statements, he often accuses his critics, to distil his testimony, or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is reinforced with the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought up his loyal fellow soldier to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant may be his testimony.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, and one of Trumps prominent interceries, gave himself great effort to defend Candidate today in an CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani that he was questioned about Mr. Trumps claims to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama had an almost unknown, small organization before Obama called her backslider, completely wrong and thus it happened because he moved troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans are attempting to argue that the government was under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton used as the Secretary of State to spread it down to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them before, on each of his words, and to be overtaken with him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't believe it!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked on Mr. Trumps excuse as only one more evidence that he is unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once more about the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a very colourful café in Williamsburg, where you could pay only bar that had no Wi-Fi but for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue Ladder front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals had been localized as the last loss in a devastating town.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York change is change, it is also new.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-year employee of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working in 2001 at Verb and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new outer scale, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, held a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old Verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He led new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu, sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are yarns such as capers and autistic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural extracts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer more, there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he notices a set of electricity to old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were pushed forward by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she was pulled to Greenpoint, she would take the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave her a while in the coffee pot, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"I was clear that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb who pleased me," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she served a Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual, but another new addition is added.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a second long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He walked in front of the work and kept unweird forever.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came a quarter to seven, every day as a Swiss torwatch and they prepare my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today, Rosenthal always gets its usual order, but sometimes he changes his Hole Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he did not have Groll about that the soap business has taken the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of coffee bars as ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go to their offer," Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café too.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translates the menu of the Polish menu, and Rodriguez said that he pretended to leave them soon, so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local saftroom would like to fill the bottling coffee in the bottles and sell.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighboring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new Verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café was closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that the locals of the Lokas and the Order felt a new coffee like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell the smell," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took lunch in the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt had a Faithful for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue as Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland Waterturtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was somewhat more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziseman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "There was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last book "Chop Suey" acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Zickman told her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, carrot snack in the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the IPcrash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh croûte with olive trees, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with mashed potatoes and vegetable soup.</seg>
<seg id="12">When trying to fry the Hackney, this was suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Zichman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap, which scattereth the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts eat that they serve them as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat-buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women coils for male riots and it was served fresh baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent to starving Europeans during the first World War. "a Square Meal" distinguishes the ways, with which the country went with it to be no longer the Schlaraffenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time in the food for the Americans a central taller topic," begged Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">As offensive was the new budget-sown: mysterious food such as breads and cassette were used to staple the cassette as a "wonderful way, food remains reiterated, because delicacy could hide inappetizing ingredients under a thick sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruits was replaced by cheaper dry obst.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had been given precedence before taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which also contains recipes, Zickman made a court made of this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition in the lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zickmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeper.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since then, budget economic systems - including Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By providing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary spaghetti, and the challenge to turn Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrot into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly tasty are the reports about the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Me-Essen posture.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he openly praised the simple Iowa farmers cuisine of his kitchen, he spelled like the millionth man of the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was very strange.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same error when not his wife Eleanor asked him to statuate a stamp with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the current owner of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Ms. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial food. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, with food, was rejected, once the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, brickering, as well as science on food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebtier is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks are usually only in winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floating at a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks get up to 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">In an hour, the Greenlanhai Greenland runs along the bottom of the North Atlantic, an average of just 1.220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it depends on it, the five-meter long animal accelerates at a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This of loneliness-shaped lifestyle seems to be a cartridge for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case of Greenland that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schablein of the Max Planck Institute for Demgraphic Research in Rostock these lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist probably suspects that Greenland was founded in Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's trophy are difficult to observe, and finally they live mainly in the Eismeer from Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">The lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle know a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time-thrillary they limbs six animals in front of Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the pine forest of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look carat, which swings out of higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland's, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was only 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyze the carbon-14 method the lens of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens appears already before the birth of sharks, which contained in it, will no longer be redone.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Its birth was therefore supposed to be after the early 1960s, when nuclear waffable try larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast with 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear war, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which arises due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14-Clock showed a 493 centimetre long Greenland, an old age of 335 years, while the record Hai might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland females first get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably the threshold of the sexually mature, and its age of 156 years was determined, Greenland's sharks can be found at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be record world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, in whose bacon on the neck, a 120 year old harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the body of the animals live on sparks living there.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and slowdown slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as early as possible as many descendants," explains the evolutionary biologist scarf.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots has unleashed a press release after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli prefix, since there were Arabic guests to have called "requested."</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" made his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by sending an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="1">Schotte Callum Skinner stormed home, as a Brite Gold for cycling team</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner raged last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when British team defending the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the scroll, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made herself marvelihood. the Jumping and did the legend proud when he was home to home a victory of the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the back of Hoys, just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time when execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap, the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man when they stayed, when they saw full potential in the shallots that unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy winners - and Skinner set a Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds, but in the standing round the New Zealand jumped in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinge was back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a major part of transformation, with the execution in a higher gear to slow it, and it is easier to allow tempo to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they went on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a Olympiarecord in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After triumph in 2012 on the page of Kennys and Hoys there were hindding that he fell off the railway after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objections of England Rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">For such a victory, this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said: "it feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, the seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of knowledge, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on 23 March (a sacred date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is equal to the Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">And he said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medallists of the day, but there were more good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the destination.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be staged on the second day of the competition at the Wiggins with safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with Beauftraded before the qualification, when the officials call him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the respective women's competition, the tomorrow continued and ended, avancated Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving his strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a score of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It's drama in the background, the resignation of the Shane Sutton technical director in April, as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first night of the competition in Velodrom, it looks completely after that, the legendary reputation, GBS, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - stand on the game because the plant operator will announce the energy supply contract, and so that all delivery contracts will be announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout of the payout is scheduled for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workplaces in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are standing on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk at risk.</seg>

<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry melt, which led to an closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland lost money and risked an closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the power price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which covers the great aluminium melts with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latino Valley, shared with it that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is in the majority owned by Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp is smaller proportions.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL continued to continue that the treaties so-called "security transactions" should have entered into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, AGL therefore assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenues," said the supply of electricity.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the proceeds on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong growth markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with the value of contracts already written in its annual nominal amount of $187 million in "anticipation of cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to make the treaties, the "ability of the" ability... to operate the melting of the melting or the power supply to the melting system. "</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 has completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that would have to come into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of explanation, why the contract has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland, Victoria and the Tomago complex near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">At the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said about 900 megawatts of electricity annually every year.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite busy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes, which would be enough to submit a high resolution today for about two selections.</seg>

<seg id="20">No one could happen in August 1996 that the communicator would be the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="7">As they were ahead in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we are floorating on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubts were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answered each other question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for single infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an option to create up to 180.000 new jobs, to create £211 bn on the same growth and a legacy of skills and jobs in order to leave the airport as well as in whole GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which has been implemented a £11 billion Swiss infrastructure program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two frequented catwalk of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow is also being one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time that we turn these Olympic spirit and Heathrow and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs, which can be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud, shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the streets and were hit by several cars, the police in Waadt spoke.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past the Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble from climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could be derived from the same conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and still slowly revolved.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet proved to be more dry areas than de earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and shook up to faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus expelled its day side of the Sun almost two months," says GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This heated the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella, to absorb the surface of a bulk of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results are average temperatures, which are a few degrees of cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, which is similar to evolution that was previously presumed by Planetenians.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years --too much heat and ultraviolet light was exposed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned down from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know them today.</seg>

<seg id="3">Alternatively President / General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately seek after a new coach.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the last three years, I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations for Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and identification," the 50-year-old Roy has been in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the course of summer, I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, needed it and bring it to a higher level.</seg>
<seg id="6">To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="7">It must also have a co-determining right of decisions which influence the team's performance.</seg>
<seg id="8">These conditions are currently not fulfilled.</seg>

<seg id="2">The labour struggles regarding the remuneration of the North Sea workers are exposed to set up all the parties for a new talk round at the table, said negotiator.</seg>
<seg id="3">Strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group were sporadically based on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Wood Group as well as the inite and rities trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current track," says it in a common statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">We will hold a few day-day sessions coming next weeks to start the beginning next year to reuse the problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The unions said that their last strike, who is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">In this year, Wood Group applied the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company accounts for a 10-percent decline in onshore-contractors in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that additional cuts to the company gives the required space to get through the market downturn.</seg>
<seg id="10">Shell has dismissed for its part of thousands of people and plans to vacate his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as its business activities are rationalized as a result of its mega-contractors with the British energy company BG Group.</seg>
<seg id="11">Energy companies are located due to lower raw oil prices under pressure, a economic situation that had been intensified by the British's decision in June to leave the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware Abwarebytes, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once more, partly several victims of a attack with pressors software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies have already been the goal of a Ransomware compressage.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to relieve the difficulty of solvents, to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their compresser software according to the observations of malwarebytes to attacks in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential solving money is significantly higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the painters were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrator software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the goal, but the change of company attacking was frightening fast in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a offering, they are looking for unlong changing files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the compressers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victim need money - mostly in the form of cryption Bitcoin - usually.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private use the personal photo database on the game, it goes with companies to provide sensitive customer data or project data bases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage incurred, if a Ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German firms generated net loss by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break the business activities completely, in a case there were people in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals victims were already threatened with attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: does not pay, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult, in view of standstill standing in operation, reject the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to establish a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researcher of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, make free accessible support sites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be saved from a few hundred euros, companies must have to pay a hard negotiating and five-digit sum to get their data unkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the Ransomware compressors the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">The more likely it is, however, that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmer sell their malware software then in the form of a software building, to the actual compressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits were developed by the malware himself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of supply is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The compressers are looking for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logins in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software as possible as many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per incorrectly calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"normally, the criminals then apply spammer with the spread," explained Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can hold back with file back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful adoption, the perpetrators will be explained instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski explains.</seg>
<seg id="41">This means the damage potential, depending on the type of data, is more than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators can now take entirely new goals in the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they could get connected with the Internet access thermostat on their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the Freischemia could be quite a solitary place to be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday use.</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda everything is unpacking in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a bit coupe and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved to be extremely flexible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m heighted HR-V is rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, just the cockpit-top falling down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk available from 453 l at high-assembled and 1026 l with foldable back-rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat rows of the back bench can be used as child chairs and provide a storage space that is 1,24 m high to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the charge height with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to do something more quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine for a further engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering is likely to be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the tested Top-Version "Executive" equipment, the equipment can be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City-emergency braking system is part of the City-emergency assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision system and the track support assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision prevention sometimes irritated because he rated many obstacles as "herent objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote control assistant works very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent tempo regulates reacts to the transport recognition and impsselt if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI jack lie under the armrest and are therefore a bit incomprehensible to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 Euro for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who want to invest so much will receive the gasoline unit from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">Engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">Honda offers a versatile and versatile car with the HR-V.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the motorway bridge</seg>
<seg id="2">It looked regularly on the road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the legal outlet is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who stand in professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in the congestion, when they drive through the motorway of Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road works extends on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Weseler Straße the right track down to 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Motorists can then turn right from the Hammer street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The great advantage: the traffic shares early to advance, making the total flow on the much-used section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea of an extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster-West Germany.</seg>
<seg id="9">The tram stop on the Zubringer annoying is the motorists above all between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">Weekdays the backrest is enough to reach the bridge over the AlberSlovenian road and sometimes also beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the Nadelöhr on B 51 shortly before departure Weser Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic will only be guided by the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built nearly a three-quarter years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations revealed that the bridge has no longer the required load capacity to absorb the heavy traffic of the heavy traffic.</seg>
<seg id="15">How long this bottleneck and that is constantly connected, the responsible state can't say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it is possible to reckon with years: because the bridge has an official rest of time up to 2034.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the extension of the legal outlet, the state operation is deliberately chosen for the busiest time in the school holidays because with disabilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, ever around, you wake up forever, at night you can't think far ahead of the wake-up cladding anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one of these problems is in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of the adult sleep problems and more than ten percent find their sleep often or permanently rather relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and they can undertake them various causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weert, board member of the German Society for Schlaitentiation and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand in it, but the Insomnia is never, so an input and sleepless disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially those who go through to sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagonnecht says the board member of the German Hausphysician association with practice in the Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Organic, psychological or behavioral factors can also be used, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is common with depression," says Weert.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors would require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes every two to three hours and starts blurred, about everyday problems and worry about, there is no example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I use sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on day should go to the doctor, advises the case.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is smitten, tired, unslept, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the problems, it is important to find out of their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, including behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleepleters only occur in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Prof. Ingo Finets, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, are scared in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact sleeping difficulties at first at bedtime, advises the case.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an investigation in sleep laboratory medicine, for example with snoring with respiratory tracts, in disease preference, or if you do not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, fixation is explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Finets.</seg>
<seg id="30">After going down, one goes to the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to electrodes on the body, one carrying a nose goggles, a chest strap and a antennas on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is drawn on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of actuator, where you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Note counts: regular sleep and rise times, not to sleep in bed, not to sleep in a bed, not watch TV to sleep, alcohol avoid and night not at the clock - then you start to count immediately, and that's quite and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler has expressed himself to the disappointing cut of the DSV teams at Olympic Games by Facebook.</seg>

<seg id="4">The former DSV-Athlete Mark Deibler has put himself in his criticism of the ex-team-mate via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where a Olympic champion gets 20,000 €premium and a Dschungelkönig 150.000 €should not be surprised by missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on Friday at his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="7">We can not compete with countries that promote very much, and don't even want to see the topic of doping or even run it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I don't say that the controls are to be stopped," he explained further.</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Deutschland (NADA).</seg>

<seg id="1">Altconstructions, a few lentils, in between still a rest of the cornerstone: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works on the first glance, but the police is one of the "dangerous locations" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Go along the street from the east to the west, one comes along with playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a gray house someone has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl which will soon be demolished, it will be built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments are supposed to be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls in the last weeks, however, preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents of the rental income, on the ground floor are still occupied spaces and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, since the beginning of the year, the police violated several occasions the police against the project, the area called "No-go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrol with 30 to 40 officers and three teams in front of the spot, closed parts of the road and kept visitors from it to enter the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the renovated building worker in the order of unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved among the youth from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer morning the road appears peacefully: parents walk with children, people sitting on the pavement before the houses in the sun, others are talking about late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the laboratory projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer who lives in the Kiez, and Jana *, who draws up here three children, are mainly generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the bonding projects, they share the concern from rising tends and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a Kiez, who wished for a majority of politic protection against vandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police take up their neighbours, obviously not exists.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which is now in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and the native residential projects belong to the Kiez: in 1990, many houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic, including almost the whole mainframe road, close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under large police battle, many of the projects were legalised in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people today, which they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has increasingly become magnets for tourists and election liners from all over the world: with them, citizens from GDR and former home network share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the tendencies, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer will be attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in the bordered discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown at dwarf.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned in this year so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbours should be regarded as a problem, that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics, almost exclusively against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make nondamage, tendencies rather to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rental house next to the disputed 94 years, cannot be a speech of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours that are not intended for this.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars make it right in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives along the street and gets more each other with, than somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately moved into the Rigaer Street and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the residents got their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neugebauer, the road will continue to take them away: due to unpredictive new buildings in former builders, which violates the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are the property apartments, which are not interesting for many here - live here rather people who are not so well done," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction is absolutely not theisted."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if one never stops someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even in the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For zoomed people who were interested in colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the left projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who move, should be aware of that - just like someone who attracts a bar in a pub, can be complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All members only presented with pre-surnames have to be called, not named with their right name</seg>

<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, Refugees, Refugees, Authorities, Authorities and Everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer from the working group indicates that Deuschle is now there that Deuschle is now, the eiving wool milder, which has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked than rather on the multitude of wanted areas - meant - meant to write the position as the administration.</seg>
<seg id="9">A administration of administrative with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a jealous wool of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially, it is about organisation, working with people on site and behind the scenes, as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It satisfies a 50 percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was the tallest time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle Ehren- and full official actors are supported.</seg>

<seg id="19">They must undertake the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is changing from the Councillor to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, whether you need to rely on private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore generalized apartments must be made, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are positioned in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments, it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training courses, training courses, one-Euro jobs and aid workers for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine Customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do-profit activities - and motivated and very tidy, how Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the job for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">It does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a belonging feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can jump up here and honesty.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it will take time and they can make time make sense to bridges, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who feel the feeling, he could not work in Urbach, should not work, and be unprofitable, who will never incorporate itself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases also exist, "says customer honestly," people, in which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this was already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A tough question: did the two have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine client quite clearly, "what mancher naiv may call it." a residual risk could not exclude it, but would not exclude it.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the topic of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attacks bring them completely into exile.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honesty of the site and in the region have to look out.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants may come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clearly to answer, the policies are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not arrived in Urbach, where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher was also well-employed to integrate the previous people reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women are embarrassing.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
