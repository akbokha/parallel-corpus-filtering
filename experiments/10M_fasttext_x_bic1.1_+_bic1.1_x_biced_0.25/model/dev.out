Obama welcomes from Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and part of the dest@@ abi@@ lizing measures in the Middle East .
but there is to be a conflict with the Palestinians , and the two @-@ member solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ ling of Israel and acc@@ uses Netanyahu &apos;s lack of willingness to the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme , supported by Obama , wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two further wor@@ sen@@ ed .
in March , Netanyahu was invited to the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress a controversial speech which was partly weigh@@ ted to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting was rejected with regard to the election in Israel .
in an emergency call , professor , to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told with a somewhat closer voice of the police that he had shot his girl@@ friend , and that officials would have to come to his house .
sett@@ ling it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was on a white blo@@ b , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved Me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled to the school grounds for 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed at the door of his office after the police .
Delta State University Poli@@ sig@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Hamburg @-@ workers had heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said he has made the fatal emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police c@@ eded him .
a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to give up a picture of what was motivated .
the details of the medi@@ ator at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw an image from a talented , but potentially difficult teachers .
students told that they were looking forward to teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ab@@ iss died , did not have history of violence or a criminal record .
he himself mentioned in a book written by his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were several incl@@ ines to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ ata , who praised the Lamb , appeared to be a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
who had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had a problem for any health problem .
this year he only hosted two online courses .
recent changes in employment policy of the University were important that the promotion , for whom Lamb had worked so hard for him , was no guarantee for a automated way to establish a Assistant Professor .
Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said that he had nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that which no answer can answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail when he entered Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner &amp; Johnson Johnson .
his car ran still in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people that lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long@@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston I said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together through mutual friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar .
he was then the sho@@ al of women .
all girls are melted when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and Pr@@ bre@@ vity were together some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there wasn &apos;t a certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who was living with them in the brick house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ab@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
Oh &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met Lamb , but he heard from his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , that he was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago both on a summer @-@ century market .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ t was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er said he was watching lamb and Pr@@ ab@@ t Night at night September 5th after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the rest@@ rooms and wondered for each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense for kid@@ ding .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester programme and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , told Don Allan Mitchell , a German professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and served as President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday E@@ vening the Delta State Campus in Cleveland took part in the evening about 900 people including teachers , employees , students and members of the community attended a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Memorial Guard , while the univers@@ ality &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect the fact that the police had said that lamb had shot the emergency , after he had shot Schmidt , and that the lamb was written in his emergency call Pr@@ ent@@ less than his wife , but there is no indication of it that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox sounds about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we stayed in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is next to me , and I realise that Princess Diana is going to sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ aps and a bracelet length of it , with the princ@@ ess of Wales on a date .

UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years in conflict and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council , USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the General Assembly on the outskirts of the General Assembly , in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ t@@ ted that att@@ itudes within the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when managing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving an nuclear deal with Iran .
8 reverse levels show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter what some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull over Donald Tr@@ ump from the top r@@ ts in p@@ olls at the bottom , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls showed Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate business .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts reported that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys had given a lead to the rising of Herman Cain , in 2011 , none of them won only a state in the nomin@@ ee process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps Di@@ assets and start to flow her dollars to pl@@ unge him .
here are some current survey results that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey at the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate business Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac agreement in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of ro@@ gue .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ torate GO@@ P would be happy with ro@@ gue as candidates .
in a survey conducted CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would have been nominated .
just two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which tell the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; delayed &quot; when J@@ eb Bush , the establishment of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be a candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is wonder@@ fully critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive claims , 52 percent of voters think that the real estate gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to the President , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to the Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his position effectively , and nearly six out of 10 independent experts say that his temper@@ ament is not at the White House p@@ asse , such as ABC / post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when setting up her nest @-@ bag , the republi@@ can elec@@ tor are real .
when asked if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CNN / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that was a change since the time when four out of ten ended their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P elec@@ tors do not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination was only 28 % for final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a multitude of GO@@ P elec@@ tors Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign looks as plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump becomes almost every one .
some experts point out that the fra@@ gment field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ dump support is spread across more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey at the mouth @-@ University beginning of September showed that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican Candi@@ dates , Tr@@ ump is harvested multiple support .
he crossed Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , especially J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ racing with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that sm@@ ites him ?
Ben Car@@ son would persu@@ ade the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head .
a prec@@ ept of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters that support Tr@@ ump , say that they have fixed their voices .
of course , much can be done to change that , and nobody can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competitors in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as often as Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they match with tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; was the immigration and the main course of the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic pressure of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans will be rest@@ art@@ ed by the Republican Party and to damage the new ori@@ ental effort .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to do Donald Tr@@ ump apparently .
the fru@@ stration over the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ lands .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there are now about half of the support of Republican voters , primarily through their out@@ si@@ der status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated over the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
here in Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive residential community - with views over the North Sea Coast .
the street is a square meter square meter for an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offering of objects is strictly limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which specific layers are one square meter most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square metre for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top neighbor@@ hoods , one of the price is , however , such as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
real estate service providers Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square met@@ ed prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several ten@@ ths of a thousand to nothing - per square metre .
but good for those who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception as an exception .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Mu@@ eller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ to@@ ze in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky shot by Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran it .
a convincing start of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ ze cap@@ itali@@ zed a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; wit@@ ches in the wit@@ ches of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off play in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ z matches ( 8@@ 2nd ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th to the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ew@@ ays after Munich in the third race .
Müller was awarded with his 28 matches in the Champions League , the Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Succ@@ ess@@ ful Mi@@ th@@ aid of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ah Roberto , who was going to pass a f@@ lange back to the World Champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ame was promised before the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 h@@ ug@@ itive fans - and the Munich visited word .
they showed a concentrated , dedicated idea , without shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home matches in the Royal class , including against famous clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled as well .
but Bavaria , in seven European europ@@ e du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they went brave , however , with her offen@@ sives efforts , however often too works .
the attacks were lead to often by gambling on the left outside Douglas Costa , who was rare against the former brown schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller left more fortunate than his fl@@ atten@@ s from the right hemisphere in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute World Champion the World Champion scored the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os falls ide@@ ye Brown struck the head of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct participation , the Tor@@ ah Roberto par@@ ed with his knees ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though Bavaria was acc@@ ust@@ omed to domin@@ ate the domin@@ ance of the country , it was able to set Pi@@ raeus N@@ adel@@ sti@@ che .
but to Tor@@ por@@ ter Manuel New was a decree .
like he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a quad@@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to muscular problems , sat down outside .
the World Cup hero was given the green light after the final finish , sports officer Matthias Sam@@ er at &quot; Sky &quot; said : &quot; who wants to make something different from it that &apos;s already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for his eliminated Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and later made everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller missed an on .
in front of the game , it was at the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ all .
after a smaller group of partly occupied Bavaria fans in their audience block was obviously the supporters of the Pi@@ raeus &apos;s supporters in words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with b@@ b@@ arians against the Munich @-@ based followers .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
anyone rough@@ out , has a higher risk of losing teeth
whoever swe@@ eping , does not only harm the lungs , but also teeth - that will create a long @-@ term study close .
the good news : if the risk is decl@@ ining , the risk is becoming rapidly .
smoking permitted a significantly increased risk of losing its teeth early .
the study has long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking they had the risk of losing their teeth at the same time ( 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 feet ) .
scientists had more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
major causes of bal@@ dness include cav@@ ities and infections of the g@@ ing@@ ival , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth weight can therefore go back to frequent g@@ ing@@ itis in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , however , smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who listened to smoking could reduce their risk within a short period , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could only take over ten years , until endang@@ ering back to the level of non @-@ smoking , First built by Thomas Dietrich , the English University of Birmingham .
people had to convince people that are non @-@ smoking , the manager of H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking causes the lifetime . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge also to good health health up to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of Zah@@ oric is neg@@ ligence , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous tests have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early bal@@ dness .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ olls the findings .
archae@@ ologists em@@ tan@@ gles of Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of the late anti@@ quity

since the beginning of the building on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been in search of the so @-@ called floor monuments .
at all construction projects in Cologne , the museum is constantly being drawn to a specialist office for archae@@ ology in Cologne .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists have now been lucky .
according to text documents , a fortress and a fortress has stood in the 4th century , explained by Trier in the 8th century .
beside the remains of the fortress and the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms a cemetery with 350 tom@@ bs were discovered , probably one of the church belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new rules on TT@@ IP trial
the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration agreement on the planned trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversial private space installations for disp@@ utes between concert halls and states are therefore supposed to be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; said the competent EU @-@ Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström when presenting .
the pig had adopted the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position for the Free Trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the largest free trade zone in the world with TT@@ IP is expected to create 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure applies in concrete that the EU states and the U.S. will jointly choose independent judges to a new investment level .
they are to come from EU , the United States , and third @-@ countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against judgments .
until now , the Trial of the parties agreed to an arbitr@@ ator , a claim against their judgments .
in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and Justice , commented by Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , she wants to work according to an international investment court .
there may be , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states .
most notably by large concerts , investor @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ Ar@@ bit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ers will be critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parall@@ els , over the company claims to transp@@ ose the tax@@ pay@@ ers , the national laws , or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in its first reports , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations like Camp@@ act discussed the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ sufficient .
it has been critic@@ ised especially for the agreement negotiated for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary of Matthias Mach@@ ines ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great progress .
the Commission was taking into consideration considerable points at the reform , by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring of 2012 .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against allowing the economy to limit the economy by too many new rules .
these small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by it , called it .
when the talks about the Free Trade Agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been completed , it continued un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA .
originally , a framework for the agreement should already be available at the end of this year .
this exact date is considered not possible .
del@@ ik@@ ey Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
besides him , a fli@@ pchart , on which the shy real estate singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , for about 40 persons , is close to Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he is related to several places he always records on the map about his min@@ u@@ rous and z@@ art @-@ arranged songs .
wherever she arose , and how it looks there , in his homeland .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has made his debut with tension at the Prime Minister &apos;s behalf of the Prime Minister .
the new Labour MEP Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo management and made it for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise , in order to ask for the first of his six pre@@ given questions , whereby his performance by media probably and the Labour MPs will probably be insp@@ ected near by the media .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p several meetings to leave them to their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because it comes after the appointment of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett team and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile the Labour Party &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the sin@@ king of the National An@@ ne on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS prov@@ okes and stands at the heart of several cover pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not to sing the national hy@@ mn , has attention on itself
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he gave the &quot; hel@@ pl@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour Party to sing the National hy@@ mn , &quot; ir@@ respective &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of sha@@ dows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on dis@@ agreements with the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leader .
the BBC correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be st@@ ack@@ ened within Labour &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference said Labour changes , in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow of Labour and R@@ ee ministers , stated that the Party &quot; was very clear , &quot; that it was only opposed to government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth labour committee , with David Cameron , ever since he is T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch speaker in parliament .
the Labour MEP , who promised a policy of policies , says that he gave &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the con@@ gest@@ ions of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will under@@ go both &quot; impact @-@ skill , &quot; and that he has begun to concentrate on serious problems , such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the sha@@ dows of economic ministry is represented , if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues may occasionally grab the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ sier , the spokes@@ man of the House of House , to discuss the problem .
when he was elected in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo . but some years later he admitted that he failed .
since she was first broadcast on TV in 1990 , the fra@@ cture was viewed by Prime Minister as the principal Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his position under his parliamentary report , although critics have argu@@ ed that they had become a caric@@ ature and require expan@@ sive reforms .

the Peg@@ i@@ da Poster in the potato pur@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it goes both - and in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , that was developed by the Ol@@ dal land@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the saying &apos; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; on a poster the Peg@@ i@@ da movement has put together the potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at the Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen random on TV .
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that is Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
Lebanese idea has meanwhile picked up in the German Patent Office in Munich .
there , according to the authority , it has been protected as utility models .
how much flesh and how many potatoes of the sk@@ ewer are , Al@@ hay will not be betra@@ yed .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .

met@@ cash starts clearance campaign campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food bulk whol@@ es@@ aler has started a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a $ 700 million invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets have prepared their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice@@ berg cleaner from D@@ uns@@ borough that distri@@ butes books and shop owner who sell to faithful customers to the South Australian football League .
it is expected to publish more details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers , alcohol , and devices will carry out its annual investors strategy .
it is much in the game because South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop business and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in Eastern nations .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in Eastern nations .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets , about five percent of the food market in these two states will be grab off and all the existing actors , but predominantly independent retailers can take away sales .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath von Morgan Stanley estimated that IG@@ A reta@@ iler could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
based on the assumption that Al@@ di will operate 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs @-@ based could cost Met@@ cash about 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern nations , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A purch@@ aser are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s can reduce sales in food and grocery by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash may probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash may disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash rejected it , public to react on Mr Dou@@ glass by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass has received contact last week .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Industry , which has been around 1,200 IG@@ A retailers globally , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which is reflected in its operating debt reduction in the same pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers al@@ it@@ ates and invested more than $ 150 million to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A retailers to improve their shops through fast growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business partner Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and loading programmes on Elan are expected and hopes that the bulk whol@@ es@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .

Than@@ asi Kok@@ chil@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Re@@ aly and deser@@ ved in view of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly in pra@@ ises his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , who is ever called &quot; special KS &quot; once again , fell into the spotlight by St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters at the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y pre@@ limin@@ atory game in Cincinnati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated with the arbitr@@ ator when Harrison , said : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat Cy@@ ril and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he struck a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f he sm@@ ashed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ending from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is at Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat as he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken out of fru@@ strations with themselves , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved very well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated with a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he goes into the team and so on , he has never worked with the other players , it &apos;s well in shape , it is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to its own studies .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ gios at the important pre@@ decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everybody , but he sec@@ ures the man out of Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the check @-@ in parts &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think Nick has really rejected the asc@@ ension which people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he &apos;s up in the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , we try to think him just outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which it can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explained Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and sealed the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept all strong who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and the servants re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled before violence , formed for an unknown time in a rural strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations have come up .
as a police helicopter ho@@ ist@@ ed against them , the migrants &apos; denied the border ! &quot; and they cried out to the Hungarian army &apos;s police .
some have been sent out of protest gro@@ c@@ eries and water .
Ser@@ bi@@ ens Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants should return from Hungary to arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collabor@@ ative damage .
there will be talks in talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation blo@@ c during a str@@ ing@@ ed meetings in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who then sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was concluded that the EU states would receive more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary put not hopes for a brief action of Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency situation in two southern regions published Tuesday gave more powers to safegu@@ ard the crisis , so that they could accelerate road blocks and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country has also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Rum@@ ania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after a fence at the Serbian border ended .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners were employed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary is for many war@@ ships of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East became a major bott@@ len@@ eck and enter the entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that on the search for a better life , they are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are eligible for protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ waited that the government left the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also refer to a prison sentence for traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said Govern@@ ments Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ists in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illeg@@ ally crossing passage is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but reporter from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs already daily .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others had already invaded the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are ready to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning , two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train stopped using bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos has given the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to edit the data of people and pushed a crowd , in order to push .
about 20 succeeded in stopping , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway between Serbia and Hungary and said they would stay food and water till they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head to Bern@@ ie S@@ anders half a national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating the national level , but Senator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders won her opposite the ground .
it now holds the support of 47 percent of democratic voters as a second time ( 58 per cent before ) , while others stands by second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t declared as if he can@@ did@@ ns for the presidential candidate , receives support of 15 percent of democr@@ atically @-@ elected voters .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates shall support them .
but Clin@@ t supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost some profits at a number of demo@@ graphic groups during S@@ anders .
Clinton keeps for a large lead in women and temper@@ ate , but these jumps have dimin@@ ished .
her support in the men is notice@@ ably reduced , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back here .
the benefit of democratic voters under 50 years have vol@@ atile , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton had one big lead in the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit lead with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now an 5 @-@ point lead with this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the parliamentary elections say that they would support enthusiasm in the country when she was nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some and another 15 percent would support them , because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support them six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are deeply impressed by her .
the views are stronger in those who are currently unable to support the Clinton - only about one quarter of them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support them .
in 48 percent of democr@@ atically @-@ democr@@ atically @-@ presidential election , Clinton should support us with enthusiasm , say less Republican voters to say about their peak @-@ edge data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 per cent ) .
when Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters in an open question is asked why she said that she has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ t &apos;s supp@@ orter , Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
the consent of dealing with problems and elec@@ ti@@ bility will also be quoted .
as the vice president acc@@ uses the potential for the presidential candidate in the scales , 57 percent of democr@@ atically elected voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is on the top .
from Clin@@ &apos;s App@@ endi@@ ces more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice ahead of S@@ anders .
decides to attack the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton raises himself ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bees in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters are confron@@ ted with the best chance to win the election ; however , this figure decreased from 78 percent to the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage of which it considers to be &quot; chosen &quot; has risen .
however , on the question , what is more important at the candidate , Democratic voters call the question of voters .
similarly as in the last month , not a single democr@@ at@@ orial candidate , or potential candidate for those elec@@ tors are made un@@ acceptable for voters .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results in some important traits of their party &apos;s presidential elections .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong guiding qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best starting with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton &apos;s honest and trusted , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have a opinion of him .
Democratic voters of the general elections are generally speaking in Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views .
with all these measurements , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal E @-@ Mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister , the majority of the Democratic voters of the presidential elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions are not influenced in total .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with its declaration , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion on this happened in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton though 36 percent said that their opinion of her might be wor@@ sen@@ ed .
they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views from Clinton had become worse .
although Clinton used the voters of their party as honest and trusted , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the vote have also seen Tr@@ ump as non @-@ honest and non trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes on leadership .
among the six tested candidate , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush , cut the best at hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than genuine , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample @-@ sample of 351 Parliamentary voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son fell back to Argentina &apos;s survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump at nationwide p@@ olls
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times , behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of voters decided in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters support nationwide p@@ umping in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey carried out on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the pol@@ l also revealed that Car@@ son sur@@ passes well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under republi@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Kas@@ i , is ro@@ uted with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who is the lowest in the lowest month , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ et@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place .
the error margin for the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of rep@@ ublic@@ s in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son rises to the p@@ olls - he ends at 19 % support with rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ro@@ gue , with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
at a glance at a rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .
pleasant swimming @-@ temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is now up to 29 degrees warm .
even though the peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough to find hot water .
a private bathroom in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
but there &apos;s no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) is divided .
but the Mediterranean temperatures continue to be the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five Members of Brotherhood advoc@@ ated with the death of a Bar@@ uch College N@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student was lodged with a student body in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder of murder are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a break @-@ up rit@@ ual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded back@@ pack with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and had to be attacked , while he tried to pursue a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about headache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood called not the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ &apos;s clothing to google and send his symptoms to google and Andy Men@@ g to call the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , Sh@@ eri@@ ff said Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the insur@@ rection began to hide and set the bro@@ therhood of the Brotherhood basically through the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Police Head@@ phone Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning upon his hur@@ ts .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g were repeated with bl@@ unt strength of injuries on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury found a charge of murder for the first five members because of murder .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with bul@@ war@@ y attacks and the formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we do not only want to act responsi@@ bly away from the involved persons , but if there is an organization , which has been officially or un@@ official - this will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; Wagner said on a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood ref@@ uses its affili@@ ation to the local group .
it will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
the interest rate comes , and the car@@ et@@ se will fall into the bath , yields for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long this will take and how long it will stop .
especially the history for the economy offers a low guide to the process .
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first rate of interest , and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor of how the economy and financial investments react .
thus , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly emphas@@ ized that investors should not concentrate on how it begins to increase interest rates , but rather the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants , however , determine that the whole excitement is possibly ex@@ agger@@ ated .
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is interpreted un@@ certainty of some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; period , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at the Capital Economics , in a communication with customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to ordinary heights , but still on low level to the seis@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historic trends @-@ based look , how some areas of the economy might react :
as seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate fluctu@@ ations for a while can be more vol@@ ati@@ l .
as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase assets 12 to 24 months after the first raise , which perhaps again the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study to what is happening after interest rate of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market has mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate hike , quite flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.6 % ) , with an average margin in the past six months , according to a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , CEO plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later on the Ra@@ ise cycle and the Return starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate the recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point at a rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate fluctu@@ ations since 1950 has only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , just few are expecting this to come and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest rate in such an un@@ question@@ able economic setting could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question , &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants have made themselves the whole year to an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee that week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all @-@ enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a Super @-@ cycle with increasing fluctu@@ ation in GDP , and on @-@ rec@@ ti@@ on@@ look@@ ers increased very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , because the market gives an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the bonds in bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic exchange .
however , bonds seem to change direction once the initial increase is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the Incre@@ ase cycle , the bond yields immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
strateg@@ ists by Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in the interest rates would result in closer fluctu@@ ations closer to longer and shorter bonds , and result in a turn from the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate although we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation expectations there is some evidence that the market has adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the income tax is fl@@ atter , credit ten@@ sion@@ ing has increased , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the market &apos;s characteristics when the F@@ ed ten@@ ded their strategy .
in the large and all , companies that will ab@@ dic@@ ate the larger part of their business activities in the United States , profit from interest rates and are more attractive to local products .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse , since a rise of dollars their products on the global market is more expensive and the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts &quot; said in a report for the clients .
companies with a strong balance sheet made companies with a weak balance after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points above .
companies with high capital ratios as well as low vol@@ atility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are losing most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock play , consumers are also benef@@ iting through the increasing dollar .
savings might see gains from higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , how fast this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
the Parliament &apos;s con@@ doms crit@@ ici@@ zed the caster for its &quot; sh@@ iel@@ ding &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly non @-@ existent in commercial ri@@ vals .
he also zi@@ pped the BBC Music Awards and said it only quoted The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dami@@ en Collins with the show The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , claiming a leader in general and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something that &apos;s private .
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public broad@@ caster &quot; being &quot; verd@@ ant &quot; and increasingly can no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; ev@@ oked &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also zi@@ pped the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously mentioned examples , with which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General director rejected the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competition when it comes to the public live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 ? I will learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is sur@@ passed .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 , to find new music and give new works on behalf , I think it really is important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder to become involved to engage the audience when it did so in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , went down under fire , to re@@ sign the commercial ri@@ vals to your feet .
T@@ ory says Dami@@ en Collins with The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it &apos;s not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - &quot; produced on special BBC fashion . &quot;
he added it , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when it was the next time an entertainment series .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further series of The Voice in the future , or add money from the fee pay@@ ers to other consumer formats .
Internet sales in August at slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe that Black Friday marks the expend@@ itu@@ res in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping mall has ar@@ isen , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into the capital cities .
but experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there is evidence that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales started three years ago , when buyers started to start selling shopping with their cell phones .
it meant more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes the one , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for decl@@ aring revenues .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year it turned five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers slip from .
experts believe that Black Friday marks the purch@@ aser incur@@ red for bar@@ gains , buyers can hold in .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that £ 5 spending money spent a little more than £ 1 online .
with some products , such as TV and laundry , more than one @-@ third of our purchases are now conducted on web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the hang@@ ings in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in M@@ ec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first bur@@ ies in M@@ ec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia det@@ aches the collapse of the vast Saudi Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured since the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , when 29 of the victims were borne through the streets to bury them that were killed when a crane collapsed in the M@@ ec@@ ca river .
dream filled , largely in white dressed , the way to z@@ ap for their respect when the first of the dead got their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ sian cemetery .
the funeral proc@@ ession passed by the Holy Sites , where only days earlier a building cr@@ an due to the ceiling of the mosque and then fell to the end .
the bodies were released for funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction companies belonging to Bin Laden by the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 men who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central mosque M@@ ec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , was on his first pilgri@@ mage to the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents at the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
Saudi officials already told us that the H@@ add@@ sch will go to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group could not stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree released by the state Saudi Press Agency , said the bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the business was banned abroad by the business .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man went to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , who pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ sch , which will be held later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has released no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also gro@@ unded the group because of its current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cr@@ ates sur@@ round M@@ ec@@ kas hat@@ chee as part of the massive construction site led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Herr@@ j@@ est family of Saudi Arabia since decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a rebellious son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgri@@ mage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy home .
officials said 158 people stay in the hospital .

other injured receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that time has over the cheapest East European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople
British employ a tra@@ des@@ man , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified art@@ is@@ ans from Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this leads to the fact that 200 other screens , which are set off by cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , will be opened
King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales will be close nationwide .
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain wants to do their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who do work in their home ,
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to the pin of walls , these days you seem to be a minority .
the British employ more professional tra@@ des@@ people to conduct Home jobs at their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ made chain , said that a large rise in number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other screens , dedicated to art@@ is@@ ans and to close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the store will be taken by women .
at the moment , the men were protecting the men .
she said it was necessary to issue the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single households , which are more than in the past than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said , &quot; You are still working a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger into a balance .
in general , half of our customers include 80 percent of their decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of the leading companies listed by only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also dict@@ ated its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has kept exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here a important theme .
it was not difficult to find good women to the Supervisory Board .
in King@@ Fis@@ her , King@@ Fis@@ her dis@@ covers a decrease in half year and sales , after the group had instructed the cost of closing of shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new stores .
functionality of a@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in judgment
on Wednesday , the Kl@@ agen@@ furt regional court ruled on Wednesday two officials of Austria &apos;s volleyball player a@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public proc@@ ession .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Public Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused was cryst@@ alli@@ zed , that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were taught of club accounts where they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
he wor@@ ries the damage with around 400.000 euros .
these sports officials are also charged because of financial defects .
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ n@@ ate , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the refuse of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence appe@@ aled to the fact that the association was at any time a asset .
the sports officials would only b@@ og@@ ni@@ b@@ ted support and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the Passi@@ va was about 600,000 pounds ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in the year 2001 .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we introduce the club or block we to ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial market .
he then co @-@ accused with his colleague and co @-@ accused to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money , put our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; he said in the case of depos@@ iting .
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money free , only no debts may be made .
moreover , the withdrawal of the re@@ inst@@ ances will be introduced back to 1991 .
therefore , only years later , a portion of the allowance demand would not be withdrawn from the year 2003 , when an increase was paid on the account .
for this reason l@@ ump @-@ form@@ - and not detail bookings , the former Ob@@ mann organised the processes .
the accounts and o@@ dic@@ tion@@ aries managed the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association had not been revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not care in detail for the financing of finance , it is important to have freedom of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when an investigation began to investigate ab@@ uses , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the agreement onto the United Nations .
those who were back , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account was the name of the second def@@ endants and , according to the association , the association did not know .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted the judge to know .
the survey knew long no answer .
then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club .
if something happened , nobody would have knew something of that money , the prosecutor was in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants was informed that the func@@ tionary was given .
this assignment has been form@@ ulated referred to as &quot; damages . &quot;
why do pollut@@ ant status ? , wanted to know Judge and Prosecutor .
the first accused he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been a harm .
but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; Take all of you all from the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? , &quot; he asked .
he said the func@@ tionary he has never moved a cent salary at never , he only could have o@@ dom@@ ination and di@@ ets .
he added a charge of di@@ ets to the club for 1,000 euros a month , but the actual effort was , however , he added much higher .
the accused did not refer to the exact documents for the early years .
these were , after an aud@@ iting , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer has been kept , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ ic@@ ism had referred to the second accused .
all behavi@@ ors were made in cash , and from his place of international law on the bank , he stated that he stated in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on September 23 with the question@@ ing of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces more 30.000 jobs
in addition to the workforce of three years , the computer ranking due to the development of the company will be re@@ building further jobs .
the positions in the U.S. computer range Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) is not able to find an end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 offices in its corporate customer .
this means that the company should be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company shared on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall off the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs in the last three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 people .
furthermore , the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share proved to be 2.3 percent .
currently , the Group &apos;s largest group based on Califor@@ nian Palo Alto is currently running : the computer and printing business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separate areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both companies are supposed to be not@@ ated on the stock exchange .
another disap@@ pointing PC market as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers after its services continued to use the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturers to Lenovo recently .
in the third quarter of financial year , sales of PC and printers were 11.5 per cent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
so the proceeds going back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
hp replies with a split and massive positions on the changing in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man only re@@ acts strongly in that customers to buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and always do more shops on the same online .
Whit@@ man restructuring plans see a total reduction of some 5@@ 5,000 positions in total .

behind it a polic@@ eman formed behind and behind the police officers , a water designer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw with stones , sticks and plastic bottles after the officials .

after that the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas has been spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bench
the world is observed when the U.S. monetary bank will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time in almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were inter@@ viewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to hold a bit longer and the interest rates will hold on the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years ago since F@@ ed interest has passed to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank could possibly leave the zero @-@ area and launching a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy has a relatively good performance , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global standards .
you have been warned of changing the markets , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good .
the decision to be announced at 20.00 o &apos;clock CET on Thursday
death sh@@ ook at the Delta State University behind dis@@ miss@@ able letters
after shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague , Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I do so sorry for the first murder and , &quot; he could make it un@@ seen , &quot; announced the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he had shot and killed him .
he has said the staff of the emergency call that police had to send polic@@ emen to its home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was at the house but &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , but probably excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers of his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police arrived the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to do it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved Me . &quot;
after writing of a note , passing over 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police destroyed him .
Professor William La@@ For@@ ge said that he had nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enz@@ y also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there was no evidence , no evidence of &quot; no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ pod relationship . &quot;
it was written by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but we stayed friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ab@@ t had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed &quot; by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ t had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ bite worked online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ab@@ t .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ab@@ t , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
the police said he listened to a certain point on Monday in order to tell them , &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in this night , he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
he received a PhD in Spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his CV was awarded to the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ ros@@ ette : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa plans to set a large group of group plans .
one half billion euros per year wants to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organisation .

as a result , Lufthansa is building its business structure and evalu@@ ates the convenience of the convenience .
the result of the real@@ ignment is a result of some 500 million euros a year from cost and income syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline shared on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer exist for passenger business in the future .
the low price line Eu@@ ros@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will soon be responsible for Eu@@ ros@@ ette in the future .
with the re @-@ launch , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ ros@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines , under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , represents the three @-@ quarter of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double Fra@@ ktur
Luke Shaw cont@@ ested the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double Fra@@ ktur of his right B@@ one .
while this is the le@@ aning back le@@ ased for wines and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal don &apos;t give up hope that Shaw can play back in that season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw was captured in the PS@@ V area .
he was dealt with nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg station and is located in the hospital . &quot;
it will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United comes very hard and then fantastic doesn &apos;t play , and then this happens .
in the changing cabin , he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and a suspension of a cub@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican .
van G@@ aal suggested that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red fal@@ sely .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty of eleven and a red card had due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back again . &quot;
here : Manchester United suffers loss of Luke Shaw if defeat at the PS@@ V
the England Defender has an additional incenti@@ ve for the European Championship in France until next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V co@@ aches , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this type of injury to the place , all are very sad .
it is never the intention of our player to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ o said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad , I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to a hospital - Chris Sm@@ alling - after a f@@ oul@@ play .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a matter that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost home .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , decided in 1971 , decided to be Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult vote , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
all nice and well , except that the subsequent ship@@ ments , in which Cameron apparently describes the action of the book , instead restored a content of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the rather short origin@@ ary text .
&quot; ami@@ dst the rub@@ ber@@ ed city of Th@@ re@@ v @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , fulfilled the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , whose real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that was not susp@@ ici@@ ously enough : the text of Cameron published on the website is reflected in part : &quot; in the silent city of Th@@ re@@ v @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , will win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits it seems to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron hears the action of the book so little . here , a un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the c@@ ash@@ less Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ nau@@ gh@@ ent beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ pers who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times succ@@ essively for a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons Elec@@ tor .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there was no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still tough .
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it &apos;s a difficult task , but if you have selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward win .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing Rec@@ ession , and the joint spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry any an@@ tics of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive approach .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed himself as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test planes is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving from the England test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as its principal trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer based on results are alig@@ ned .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I told it - players are their own choice .
long ago , one would have pro@@ lon@@ gs the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over its own dest@@ iny .
when hopefully get out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes out .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not perform so good achievements , and it is not surprised ; he is mainly a team of team .
the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man receives , to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th won seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton gets the chance to play home and go away .
the only accus@@ ation that was to rise was that England was first put in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in high shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a striking I &apos;m standing tall .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances of getting before him , but this depends on the team placement in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een beside Cook , which would give an extra spin Bow@@ ler and got four j@@ icks , appeared , and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t strike there , and this left hand has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s devil &apos;s cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een might have got his job to his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there is no difference .
my previous team mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop before starting in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred rings straight and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes up in the Ka@@ es as a Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited manner with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people possibly see his statistics on - on average 31 with the bats and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup bra@@ ins that up@@ lift their hands and the train@@ ers opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England , England gave a few smart ad@@ ditions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the tests could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est score of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes into the white sphere of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights , of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices may bring fresh air in the changing cabin , even when the messages are in line with the previously said .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some may not agree , but co@@ aches and team engineers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as in the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in light .
the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = Exp@@ and@@ ing Great Britain from the EU ) could get to Zul@@ u if the economy grows into a Fl@@ ush by 2017 .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ du@@ gor@@ ging new negoti@@ ation strategy to stick the UK in the EU , even without the choice of the in@@ gen@@ ious Jerem@@ y &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ates severely due to Europe on Tuesday .
also foreigners have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ate , recent states that some member states , deeply dist@@ ressed in different crises such as the EU is now , not always from their own debt , Great Britain &apos;s own agenda , and distur@@ bed contrac@@ tual changes , which they usually don &apos;t want to get satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain in the interior of the EU Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let us not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves out that more and more short @-@ supervised ministers and civil servants come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous lawyer Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) happened .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left wing .
it is hard to imagine that they will get out a leg in order to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to do because most similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies lead .
hence , some such ministers may not plan to un@@ help remarks , throughout SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; the re@@ trial was a ple@@ ite , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing out of a new ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics have been the press of oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press department in 1975 but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can recall Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who showed himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his promises , Ed &apos;s Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to do this , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ car@@ bure@@ au sh@@ ur@@ king , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ling foreigners , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ incar@@ nation , who have most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir was similar about it , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him , rather than going up to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ v@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he refused to disgu@@ ise himself as Cam@@ er@@ ons , because Bla@@ ir had refused the principle of the Constitution which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it to him an back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ n , who gave me a friendly ghost on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to bar@@ gain for me - seems at danger of repeat the boy@@ cott of Mur@@ a &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s years , an error at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I &apos;ll press it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p traditional bladder tendency and the wil@@ ful fellow of Tor@@ n Small @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV this week said when the sc@@ ou@@ ting in him began to admit that cor@@ mor@@ n dis@@ appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as sound Chancellor was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to make an effort to be loyal to his co @-@ cabinet at home without going too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said that something J@@ C told his fellow workers and members after all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the ag@@ ony bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ b@@ n wants to con@@ vey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe who permit him to hold lab@@ ours in the refer@@ end@@ ment campaign for self @-@ compreh@@ ension as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks about that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundament@@ ally am@@ big@@ u@@ tively for the EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , which is a central principle of the dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .

experts critic@@ ise the public Health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking was originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et signed up by critic@@ ising the evidence of the public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Review &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the load capacity of the data and referred to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month grab@@ bed the &quot; exceptionally tiny basis , &quot; based on the P@@ he its most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; to build stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public would expect the claim that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of re@@ modelling and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were called to create a model for multi @-@ critical analysis analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of different nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director was to receive from British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the Refer@@ ences of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer but not the financing which he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee will not be shipped , but also includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarette Champions , some of which also state some sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line from P@@ he participated .
the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ essed that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; that Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , no such connections or restrictions in the P@@ he report will be discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of P@@ he states that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking people were premature . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smoking dies on his suit .
all the evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has a unique obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what the evidence proves and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers facing the tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national competence .
BBC should give East@@ En@@ ders , former CEO of Channel 4
former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give its right arm &quot; for hit shows as Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fees should only be used to make the kind of programs that will not be sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for providing them public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time window against the most popular shows of their rival and Sen@@ ders ( BB@@ C4 ) .
after the BBC director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years at his time with Channel 4 , with the BBC to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC &apos;s programs are on behalf , or send it clearly by non @-@ subsi@@ dised ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of its investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fees , what I keep in or in the long term for a good idea , you should at least give his production at least for programs , the other hand or in order .
you will send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous , it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reig@@ ning tax is financed , which could also be subsidi@@ zed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ l@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this is to be public @-@ real television .
I don &apos;t think that the BBC would actually decrease .
Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC continues to hunt for reviews : &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of men who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will be back again , leading the former Director of Sky , Tony Ball , at his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows such as East@@ l@@ der should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal Hungarian programmes can &apos;t go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the public opinion , but they can argue that if they go out to their apparent missions to just@@ ify the just@@ ification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window where no one wanted to see them ever .
with the broadcast fees , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course , you think all , think that one gets a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 , wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ bri@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to check and enter@@ tain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as a formation - he said it &apos;s 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take a look at the publicly @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform , clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot;
at the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV will be shown and with the commercial Sen@@ se Alli@@ ances , to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ es &apos; can control brain cells via sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des will change the direction in the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have been bred worms with genetically modified nerv@@ ousness , which can be controlled by removing of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have heard with sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
impul@@ ses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells which are genetically modified to bear the membrane channels that react on ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the worms revealed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ es , used for ultr@@ asound , in order to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ en@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths brain stim@@ ulation , a inv@@ asive procedure which gives electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
f@@ aden@@ worms shall not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani knew that when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found out , rein@@ force ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate the worms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves affect the opening of these ion channels and activ@@ ating the cells , which are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry on .
when switching ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied by micro@@ fib@@ res and commit to worms , where they turn the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has several simil@@ ar@@ ities to Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a breakthrough tool that enables scientists to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technology .
in contrast to the light that has to be sent out on an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic axes can pass un@@ marked by the brain and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily dis@@ astro@@ us human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence at a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ dial re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but now I remember the ten@@ ded smile of those who I stum@@ bled - and to the numerous , long @-@ vo@@ iced complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve lear@@ nt , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in a student residence is enough of easily sho@@ ck@@ ling up to an absolute sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to p@@ added : people tell whence you come from where and where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you have said frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out those people who like to speak with whom you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film @-@ night event venues and municipal con@@ jun@@ ctions , but they are also the places where people prefer to get their under@@ wear .
herein lies : do not think about the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted , a rough handling at the university .
their rooms should be a refuge , but many student residence cultiv@@ ate a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bite culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you have to go away so I get back the energy that I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ mil@@ ate of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
ap@@ rop@@ os t@@ p : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the not@@ ion that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with baking .
since you start at the cli@@ max of the Back @-@ mania , the clo@@ cking stick to the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile , when I give you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats , a good way to close friends .
their fellow occup@@ ants are committed to enter@@ tain themselves and will associate your face with a great surprise .
of course , it depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
po@@ or@@ ly cont@@ ested cl@@ ump out of flour , sugar and fat make sure people put sleeping , when you pull anchor .
to steal food is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ?
check the mil@@ king owner .
the chances are good that they say to nour@@ ish yourself , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my fellow woman who added her milk a pur@@ i@@ der to pun@@ ish di@@ pping .
she is in prison now .
you shouldn &apos;t make any noise , the people from sleep or from working .
it is not just about being a constant man , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who sit in gl@@ ash@@ aus .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours , if they had something going out , drum &amp; bass had a little qui@@ eter than at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and they had an examination in the morning .
they acted on it with still loud music .
when she stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours with two hours sleeping before she shut their own music and shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would coinci@@ de with the same student residence ?
the vice versa , it would not be fundamental too , if you have a co @-@ resident for your future sp@@ ouses to separate themselves and then you will have to see how they move up all common friends ?
of course , the heart opens its own way - but if a hot co @-@ resident is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to talk a little reason for your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his non @-@ closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing fine as it seems .
a good stre@@ ak is funny , but it only takes moments , until he becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
replace a valuable and am@@ using lesson through safety - but never forget any sharing room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close your door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but put their poss@@ essions to the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all @-@ day operators
the estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner is building the Eck@@ ental Hair @-@ terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the killing mother and the straight operator . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how you can build good and well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old at the interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the domestic market .
owner Mark Gil@@ dner believes that rapidly among the favorable living space can be created : he builds for refugees in a single project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the residential market .
what solution do you offer ?
mark Gil@@ dner : no sustainability in containers or gy@@ ms ;
because people remain in a great part here .
in view of refugee stro@@ ms , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely tri@@ vial , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs a f@@ ew@@ est place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that is different , when people are living in motor@@ homes .
each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
land@@ lord : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is worth € 184 billion , without property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took 6 months .
this is fair .
did buildings make their plans difficult ?
Gil@@ dner : I correct my project correctly .
it always makes it easy , it always makes the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sl@@ oth special construction and the plac@@ ements .
gri@@ ppy and wild .
it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the people react to their town@@ house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who was accused of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not right .
but do you not stum@@ ble the compet@@ itor to affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , in the last five years we had a boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the killing mother or the straight line alone .
I &apos;ll show how to get cheap and well @-@ built today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updated is released
the new operating system can be requested by clicking to &quot; General &quot; type and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install installation .
some are encountered after installation , since they get an error message that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
in order to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is tra@@ ced or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may potentially mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has it more unlikely to do this if you insert a special tool to install apps , and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charging during the updating , or is located near a charging device , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple is not rele@@ asing that the update is going on , as the phone may turn off on half way and could lead to a breakdown of updates .

&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients still often see , &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ stin .
her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border checks are also on our southern border , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
as before , it is clear that everyone who wants an asylum application will also be &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; of course .
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that there is significant signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , even over the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government previously reported that Slovenia would want to continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
for this , the Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar was not seen in Lai@@ bach , however .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled .
as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ in wants to avoid over@@ locking the borders for refugees .
&quot; each member of the EU must fill its obligations , otherwise the system won &apos;t work , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government exp@@ elled , the first refugees had already attempted to leave in the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to devi@@ ate for registration .
in the vicinity of the Croatian police , the Croatian police captured them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , major police vehicles have ever met with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
they take action primarily about Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees told the interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would have participated in the Maced@@ onian Serbian border that previously carried to the Hungarian border to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade qu@@ ailed , however , that it may be to propose certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; it said .
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the town of Si@@ d in the morning , during the day , further buses would be expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were the last night of the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this may be , indeed , to the ob@@ servers of the existing Balkans @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for mar@@ g@@ inal control &quot;
in Croatia , Croatia of the Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic earlier st@@ resses that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong motor stro@@ king of refugees designed to provide for possible measurement situations .
he did not refer to details but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member , comprehensive possibilities for border controls . &quot;
one perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of that , since 2007 , the EU partners represent a good testimony in the country since 2007 , affecting the standard border controls .
on the Hungarian border , approximately 300 refugees were stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os which led to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now on the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was trying to calm on Wednesday early at a local eye clinic in Hor@@ g@@ os : he keep the debates about Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high refugee deal .
they could not say that they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
helper for Mig@@ rants - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers had already started to distribute the refugees wander@@ ers on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still no more spacious mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ stre@@ ak was sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Res@@ izes , Incre@@ ased Finance Outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery v@@ ans lowered his gain to a full year due to the weak@@ est demand for freight services and higher costs in its boat transport service .
the company also said it plans to hire approx . 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share came to more than 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening of Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year ending in May , 20 cent less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected due to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases which will be on an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite a higher consideration for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that it is nevertheless expected to increase earnings from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; solid earnings if you think the weaker economic conditions , especially in production and global trade , has been considered . &quot;
the plans for vacation jobs were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to set 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the third quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ continued 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research asked analysts predicted .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks surveyed analysts expected € 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has achieved a decline in the international pri@@ or@@ acy shipment , which brought the turnover in its unit Express cover to stag@@ n@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Ground .
during the last quarter , sales of the boat transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result for higher labor costs in freight transport declined .
within the pre @-@ market trade , roughly one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks collapsed by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2,5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent of losses for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at her most anticipated conference in the years Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week to decide whether it is time for the first time ever since almost a decade of the lead .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey seat of seating there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder of the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues intend to set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order by the US Congress : maxim@@ ise US employment and prices remain stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ born mandate for financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predic@@ t them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented up@@ to @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data from the economy have shown that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence at the global financial markets make it a c@@ auti@@ ous proposal to rein@@ force these vol@@ atility for federal bonds , and it is only one percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , who was secretly with Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think that if they were looking for a pre@@ text , the increased un@@ certainty is not increased in order to maintain the global market enough to maintain , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed will do , which guarantees themselves to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently questioned about Bloomberg , interest rate was predicted this week .
financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicators out of only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists im@@ pose the strike by saying that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial scores saw an average of 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy pursued the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does it , &quot; Should it go very far in its explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they will not fall into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would be calm down the financial markets , because they were the un@@ certainty of when the F@@ ed will act .
a few months ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow con@@ gest@@ ion of monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that it would be necessary in this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the proposition .
although the creation of job had slow@@ ed in August , improvement was solid on the labour market this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to levels which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage differentiation have shown signs of recovery .
although inflation was constantly going under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economic .
but the financial markets throughout the world were gathered together at the end of the month after China had appreciated his currency .
in May , the Dow Jones Industrial average was more than 16 % below its highest rated while investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would change the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the Dow now stands at almost 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives influence the market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculations , when you should increase interest .
&quot; if events appear on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not appear , they would consider in this session the re@@ ins , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US bank@@ note .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month in order to get the effects better in the grip .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data which describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so they should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed Monetary Agency in the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere notice of the time leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could translate their monetary expansion &quot; tight &quot; by turbul@@ ence around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments on other locations , but also coun@@ s@@ elled with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding for global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more Art than Science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of global strategy for the asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked the course that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ flow to financial market movements , which seems to be associated with the economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to an interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their leading position by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited impact on growth in the United States , &quot; L@@ acker said .
a year later , the F@@ ed representative cancelled this cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the Com@@ par@@ ment of the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and not menti@@ ons the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of time .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy style
this Brazilian rec@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy in sho@@ cking way women as important as good diet during the breast@@ feeding time . it does this with presentation of images of babies which are painted in breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which provide babies all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , homosexu@@ als and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary supplement which should carry mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the community of Bern@@ ardino approved the building request for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be sh@@ allow@@ er for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ longed turn@@ al construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Ground step forward by step forward : in the youngest community of communal gardens , the elabor@@ ated building request was blessed without large discussions .
previously , the body , among other things , had decided to apply a motion to a build @-@ legal &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ite &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form in the roof structure .
therefore , a &quot; s@@ quad@@ ron with non @-@ sympath@@ y first and roof stand shall be built . &quot;
background of the planning is the designated use of the roof for solar installations : &quot; thus , we got together a wonderful southern roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the liberation &quot; liberation &quot; turn again around the roof , which is prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - is to lie below ten degrees .
in this way , the volume of hall is significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because there was no &quot; exceptions &quot; plan of the development plan - and the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council should rather be restric@@ tive to liber@@ alisation .
however , there is no recur@@ ring project at gy@@ ms @-@ construction : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gy@@ nec@@ ological building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs about 2.3 million euros are calculated .
grants are expected from school and latitude .
the next processing of procedures for the 18 x 36 metre series will now be presented to the Coun@@ cill@@ or for the test .

Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to P@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the administrative district , who confirmed the Land@@ lord Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision on this meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans should be implemented , all close to 50 employees were employed at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital .
the vast majority should be moved with Fischer and the larger inside Station to P@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff that are not able to con@@ jug@@ ate to con@@ jug@@ gle is supposed to be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered the change to the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is first managing director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now converted to a private practice in immediate proximity to the hospital .
with the question of who is to come up , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game which declared itself ready to take over the management from 1 October , taking over his team to Sh@@ ong@@ au .
for the building in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in all cases a &quot; recovery &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .

fishermen vote on the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the board of directors are entitled to lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ies , which has only 35 beds in the next year , should definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the district had previously planned for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital was completed .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , re@@ acted rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I &apos;ll close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several reflec@@ tions .
there are currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ th@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry horses .
&quot; what better we could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer has been taken over the tor@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who have been positively received by the employees &quot; positively and very understand@@ ably . &quot;
a real Per@@ spective for the House , in which Fischer has been working as a director for more than 30 years , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure of closure in the past decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more refugees are seeking a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distributor competition on the German housing market has long begun .
with the incoming refugees and working hours from the EU , more people are pushing onto a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income visitors to the last paid apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this results comes from a study on behalf of the &quot; Social housing &quot; consortium .
for comparison : this year , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
a total of 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as an asylum seek@@ er in an emergency accommodation .
many encounter the home market and rows in the long queu@@ e in front of the apartments .
according to Stati@@ st@@ ian Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only in the increasing refugee numbers .
the study also makes considerable sales in the housing estate of the last years .
Germany loses a residential deficit , which is bigger from year to year .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
many of the employment died in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the housing market .
the number of square metres per capita has sun@@ k again in the major cities in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incenti@@ ves are to boost the social housing .
thus , the basic tax rate could be om@@ itted , and the base tax for funded flats will be exposed .
according to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ adjustment possibilities are needed .
the sponsor@@ ing programme for refugees of the motor vehicle Kf@@ W comes already well in cities and communities .
a good week after the launch , a good week after the launch of 184 million euros , more than half of the 300 million euros have been sold at the disposal .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free money : Croatia and Slovenia addressed Cor@@ ridor
after Hungary , practically no one gets away , there are more refugees going on the road across Croatia .
Zagreb announces that the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate to the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian Minister of Interior , and when necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country in Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken down to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL has been reported .
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which occurred on the same day are practically unnecessary to over@@ flowing asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic said : &quot; they can travel , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these fol@@ ks are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something .
however there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police en@@ acted Croatia in the morning by the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbourhood .
most of the media reports report@@ edly went from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came from both bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they attempted to walk along the green border to Croatia .
the refugees viol@@ ate the border to the Croatian Serbian border .
the border drift of other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine@@ fields should now rapidly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , no more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 affected people .
shortly before Tor@@ ry on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws , over@@ coming and damage the border to us as an off@@ ence .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore instit@@ uted in the south Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted of prison sentences up to five years and the deportation of the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ eth in the border ended on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there still had 40 refugees .
practically speaking , nobody has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
before the &quot; transit one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to get up .
they gathered the tr@@ ash , the tens of thousands of people left in the road@@ side last weeks .
bar@@ red ventil@@ ator have been dismant@@ led and one of the bearings in the border was remo@@ del@@ ed .
no one was wanted for the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
furthermore , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
to the end of the 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of this journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
regular groups of refugees meet regularly in Freil@@ assing .
Mayor of &quot; rock &quot; over the fron@@ tier
&quot; after the bridge festival held on Sunday with the premises , there were suddenly 10 people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists wanted , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was un@@ expect@@ edly struck by the refugee in Austria on Sunday , but in W@@ ern@@ stein , the city who immediately offered his help and ran together with two additional hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before that , we only once visited the un@@ trusted guests , with snack and beverages .
we said right away , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; this was self @-@ evident &quot; for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t leave , to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we are very happy , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
at Sunday evening in W@@ els of a ICE train started on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE train to Pass@@ au , after the announcement of the announcement that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still beyond the border .
the regional train was put off at the W@@ ern@@ stein line before the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge firmly combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , first day a branch @-@ bridge - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án must now send us more Z@@ ig@@ ans to us , is a logical result of a apparent policy :
instead of having to help in the R@@ ös@@ c@@ ke stock , our Federal Chancellor , officially ass@@ ure human rights , has officially decorated the attitude of Hungarian authorities in the dark circle of Naz@@ ism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ ding these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are faced with cha@@ otic conditions now in the border areas .
the poultry must also be discovered that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which she has invited and welcome , is nothing but another refugee camp .
a major challenge shall become a challenge , in view of continuing refugees and the ending winter , to create decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers .
and yet greater will be for greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search for 35,000 winter@@ time Qu@@ arti@@ ce
Konrad has delivered all hands full with the refugee operation .
Christian Konrad is that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to set quot@@ as for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the tender age center , Konrad , has already received the grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ ine@@ kirchen , &quot; he told of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior said on it , on the other hand , a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad with an demand of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ iles in the he@@ ur@@ ling year anticip@@ ates .
to meet the numbers , 35,000 accommodation will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
with the sovereig@@ ns , he has already conducted discussions .
these would have backed him , even for the upcoming Refu@@ gee quarters .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expectations are the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator in the ORF promotion as well as we . &quot;
based on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
it is also hop@@ ed for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er recognised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; highly serious . &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it could not be that qu@@ il@@ is@@ lators must have a certain height of the towel holders , or size of finishing touches .
for a temporary time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
contrary to the Ministry of the Interior in contrast , he has been successful with his experience .
I am an older Lord , to whom you do not without further notice the truth .
superf@@ icial force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the Republic to cause any cost as they stated himself .
their employees want to increase it to three or four .
the own qu@@ ain@@ ti@@ dal has yet been not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz demands a better distribution

this is not necessary for those affected by the parties who are currently sub@@ ordin@@ ated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , for an emergency , further locations should be checked up to its capability .
criticism in the distribution of refugees within the country of the country .
other districts have also to contribute to their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed ! &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday the further procedure in the refugee question is corro@@ des .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic would continue to be possible .
however , there is now the respective border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the protective addic@@ ted would have been brought to Germany with regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger went for more increased solidarity in the refugee question .
the fact that Austria also leads to its borders once again , is &quot; a logical sequence &quot; from the passing of the Germans .
the next Run@@ tastic is a question of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the line of industry is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production facilities , the stock exchange turnover is S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard and later also to ac@@ qui@@ res .
from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - with which Nieder@@ n@@ haus@@ er promises a lot more : &quot; the next Run@@ tastic is just a matter of time . &quot;

the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; but I have also asked whether I am going to open a shop , &quot; Bre@@ it says .
decisive for the decision was , amongst others , the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a site , in which only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Region of Linz to sell this trademark , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own Italian roots .

Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also at word - so with the statement that he would certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
but he didn &apos;t put it to the king of my heart .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit big la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the applicant , says it .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the applicant .
the ro@@ gue &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the late grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation stone of the property company were first sites in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from the tragedy : her desire to return to the homeland again , in the Bavarian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was back then .
he didn &apos;t record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute of Pe@@ el@@ ian History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared a film launch .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immigration . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ y mark of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly inter@@ cep@@ ted over Mexican immigrants to the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pol@@ ating , it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relationship of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was a borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; he is always so short . &quot;
do you think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 year old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension industry in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned as much K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that the Heinz came in a visit to the church organ with a visit to the church , which was generally well arrived .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
you get it better if he didn &apos;t gain your choice , because &quot; it has such radic@@ als but I do not know if this is good . &quot;
if those who had his grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been as he said , &quot; he had never arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ast Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and when President ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; it is , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe , without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ el &apos;s film , been inter@@ viewed for the dump of a long time , 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ bles have seen , even in the USA the interest w@@ akes up .
the Bavarian community of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice President , at the German alpine verein , Ludwig Wu@@ ert@@ cher@@ en@@ nig , the village of 1800 inhabitants in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden got the award for gentle tourism in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
the Alps is in the neighbouring country , where the award is responsible for the award .
a &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fif@@ ths of his surface must be exp@@ elled as a sanctuary .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , the loss of leadership in the Today Show .
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson face to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als but it has no large shifts in ratings for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast from the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull gave the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Cook and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , set up in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play no role in Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to Today 33@@ ,000 .
today there was a slight increase compared to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
in the past few months , Today finally closed the gap in Sun@@ rise .
in August Today , Today reached an average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now Sun@@ rise has at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators about 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing every morning happens .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of rep@@ to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thomson .
the new drama of a recently de@@ dowed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had asked whether Thomson &apos;s a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result from last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven has remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , an average 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half an hour of The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot water average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at ultimately takes place at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret reveals ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably won &apos;t know who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was covered in the sec@@ rec@@ y sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give low , whether they are the one who received the last Rose .
but when we talked to Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three , you may have acci@@ dentally put a note on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips to be sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have left out on ly@@ rical ways , why Wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive approach as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , when the question is asked , &quot; If you do , who ought to get the last Rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game destro@@ ys who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except for themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought that in the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows said .
Sarah stands at the feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the last week &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , I realised that this is obviously not just a game - I am now subject to it , &quot; she said .
and when asked when he was asked to choose who wood should be , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be at Ten : 30 p.m. on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the U.S. - and there were many other teams who sent requests after their impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne on the rest of the game when he lost another angel , as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ Liga @-@ Conver@@ tible in his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday with 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t Return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing cabin by the game .
instead of being able to grin@@ d the team to the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne on public at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ s@@ Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by Special Operations Coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his failed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ anced with a pun@@ t who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian descent for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could imagine a worse starting to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and this is it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne opens the Schn@@ itzer with his debut at the time in 2007 when a passport contributed to a T@@ ry for Queensland with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
nevertheless , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game , and posted it on its Inst@@ ag@@ ram .

&quot; it &apos;s not going on , we have to say to the causes , &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor .
previous asylum seek@@ ers want to shut@@ down the free voters as soon as possible .
therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger has also requested more staff for the administration courts , responsible for asylum @-@ su@@ e : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum conver@@ ters , &quot; Ai@@ w@@ anger said .
the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistently alig@@ ned : &quot; we need nationwide European standards of the German states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to act whol@@ es@@ ome . &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy should not fall among the table .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal .
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police decreased in a crowd , who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a public official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu City .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive officials , said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers were assembled outside a police station , with some of them threw stones and bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have deployed Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , and then shot down in the air before she res@@ umes from Gum@@ res@@ ale .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the Gum@@ mig@@ rant , known from those who are used to kill , but traditionally used as a less@@ er alternative , obviously a so high death rate produced .
the discussion was the last few weeks of violent protest in N@@ ept@@ . of southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ei@@ i say that new provinces that were formed within the proposed new constitution would decrease its political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the Eth@@ nic Group of the Th@@ arus that would like to state a state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent cl@@ ashes since the year 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces , an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , the age of centuries .

Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL , O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign to bring about 11 million US $ for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees that will out@@ roll the European nations , since they flee from war and allied countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations in his blog .
instead of leaving a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old , had her personal experiences .
&quot; our journey belonged to many dark railway and bus routes , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / promises to be doubled to $ 11 million .

coverage from Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily overweight diabe@@ tics may be helpful by weight loss surgery .
the advantages of losing weight surgery for slightly over@@ ge@@ ful people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new trial at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether easy @-@ to @-@ use people with diabetes after losing weight loss surgery longer than those who received non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data needs a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert for weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas surg@@ eries have proved effective in treating type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were carried out in people who are disease ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes by people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI among those who underwent this operation , dropped from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI with the non @-@ surgical treatments received approximately equal to 29 .
among those dealing with a surgical procedure , in 36 % the diabetes condition dissolved itself completely and at 28 % .
the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group dissolved itself in comparison with diabetes only by one percent , and in some cases , with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols , were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , and found the authors .
the researchers also monitors the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c will be held best at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not dimin@@ ished the mortality in five years , the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also aff@@ ection@@ ate average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached bigger decl@@ ines in BMI ( 7.4 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival benefit in surgery after five years , there are indications from a study heavier people in Sweden , that operation is leading to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was under@@ taking approximately 29 percent less likely to die in obesity , about 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted conventi@@ ons .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for individuals who have a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously when the patient sits between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , having associated with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not include all the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visiting in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be set before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ized that the response to West European countries would be ad@@ mi@@ red on the refugee crisis , but the situation isn &apos;t appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama engaged in Austria &apos;s efforts to safegu@@ ard the crisis , he stressed that it was a temporary solution .
&quot; in order to worry about several thousand refugees , it is wonderful but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like a real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands , &quot; he emphas@@ ised .
finally , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never replaced these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented George Bus@@ h@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and turned out that the US violent response to the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after the 11th September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he crow@@ ned violence , and that was imp@@ a@@ waited consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four times increase of using ham@@ de@@ des@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
poison @-@ control centres in the USA will report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , causing massive alcoholic drinks , so the Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues by hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants on children under 12 years have been reported to report the tox@@ in control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children always come more often to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said some of their children to drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some of it do to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mutation of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ ths disinf@@ ect@@ ant will drink only because of a budget experience .
juven@@ iles allegedly mixed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcoholic di@@ lu@@ ent water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be sc@@ aled by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( Hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are par@@ don@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and or@@ anges that are very appe@@ aling to children .
disinf@@ ect inf@@ ection contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
in particular with infants , a few spl@@ ashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the pois@@ oned centre at the Hospital of Kansas University , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not leave gor@@ ging whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from a strawberry du@@ ck @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency intake for the treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold who has been legally drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor absorption doctor who treated her at G@@ w@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah opened her words , and was not able to go as she arrived in the emergency intake .
doctors supervised them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and felt the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ op@@ s Mother , CNN .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
alcohol pois@@ oning were also connected to a number of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , following the swal@@ lowing of ham@@ de@@ des@@ infection , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities believe that the product me@@ thanol contained a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students in the fourth class were in New York City , their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher in pois@@ oning , creating anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says it a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against ham@@ mo@@ des@@ infection and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police viewed the negotiated plan as &quot; guns , &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary action to the school authorities .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May until July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without working for the United Kingdom had risen by 10.000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was over the NSC 631570 group , according to the figures for the National Statistics Office ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment fell to Scotland by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

it is almost exactly a year that Scotland met the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .

why am I to be a witness to O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it is not happening , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was already mentioned for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agree .
when the day was closer , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available as places available , a ma@@ kab@@ ere lot@@ tery take place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will watch it more emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit close to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone data and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh , when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to record a not@@ ep@@ ad and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has accused me on Twitter , my in@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you receive access .
I compl@@ ained of it with her .
she admitted that &quot; it could have better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants to present an international rep@@ orters to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work is against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the show of po@@ d@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would do him to his action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can apply for it .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man an un@@ necessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to hit him and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy says that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tries to install a spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to end the race immediately .
he appe@@ aled to the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ator Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday for a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing and he himself found himself in difficult conditions than it went to explain the positive cob@@ alt @-@ Tu@@ est rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months for es@@ pion@@ age , and did not want to see it as high as tall &apos;s grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing to say about it , and I could eat long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
they know that it &apos;s wide .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home this evening and sleep well .
I want to walk up the main church , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they begin to think , I do not doing that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had considered the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had attempted to sp@@ ying out its stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart said in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy said to Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ ei@@ ver .
if that is the case , they should certainly hold on their n@@ oses , because they were trying to hold me , failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the Route L , David Moo@@ dy , CEO of Route L , and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of Route L , were aware of it and are still today .
should I bring it to mind that it is personally ?
does the RV@@ L dare to behave and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I too bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I am at the point now , on which it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the vehicle levels of the train@@ ers have built up at Li@@ dar@@ i with the long lasting Kob@@ alt study , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could be &quot; his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the remains black C@@ avi@@ ar , noted the racing @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack was s@@ worn by mud or clay to the horse &apos;s plane , which viol@@ ates the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to accept the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff has worn out mud on the leg .
it could have been that evening .
it would have been the whole day to be so , what was like that .
but it had it that day on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack . an inquiry into the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people , who set up these rules , do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all saw that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy looks back against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ er in@@ verter won the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring@@ keeper &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Bennett made a scar@@ ed note on the Storm team after his team had reached the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she is only concentrated in the tac@@ kling &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers on his team have been speaking to it , since it was de@@ emed that they were worried about to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring competitions as they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ent is there for three years now , and he obviously had a great team to train . he is therefore not willing to lose it , so it was a little shock for him .
it &apos;s already funny , as it comes back to this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked his ment@@ or idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or is that Benn@@ i St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a cra@@ ck .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch out as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you &apos;ve got this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this .
I build stronger faith because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to be able to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t remember that when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters have recorded a higher result than the game of the game of bronze against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are there breaks , and do not have any points tigh@@ tening ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they are mentioned , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has free this weekend since they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night on Saturday night . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit to drug ad@@ age
a man who may possibly be sentenced to life imprisonment for a lifetime of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which have been decorated to Queensland , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the police found 100 kg of the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life penalty for attemp@@ ting to own a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the Café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of danger at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of punishment , he lied the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ mother had offered a $ 200,000 deposit as security , together to reach his event@@ ual release .
&quot; after reading the en@@ dowed explanations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a 200,000 dollar &apos;s guarantee is a real financial burden , &quot; Judge Flan@@ agan .
but the alone will not go out to hold it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ated to his Australian and his Serbian passport to call on the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to attract ped@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ iles used the phone for an 11 year old girl to ask pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service offered by which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , conf@@ using messages , and al@@ armed immediately to her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; Web research , which used to search for an independent image of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed responsibility against the officials , that he would have done it as it was to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the internet . &quot; and he then &quot; called &quot; a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the attor@@ ney in Ei@@ li@@ ie Robertson said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searching for the computer of him was done , but said it was to happen because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent his images and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to attract them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he would then see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson , when the maid found the news on the phone , she called her mother , and was in the trem@@ bling and with weeping .
she then looked at the bare pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Playst@@ ation used to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he .

defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g will not appear in the register of sexual off@@ ender , since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element is going to be found in his fault .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael dep@@ ended the verdict until October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was still admitted by the date of judgment in the directory of sexual crimes .

that &apos;s it : all two years the makers show their news on the International Motor Show .
in 2015 , above all the movement of compact cars , we are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently more popular : around 28,@@ 1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment , according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation stage 17 - 27 September ) .
this year , there are many new compact models presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , who will be marketed in the autumn by the dealers .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann to the fair .
he belongs to the core of the brand .
the new Astra is also well @-@ sold at the same model , the new Astra is intended to get much more expensive .
Opel is launching a drop below the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced at 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , Hessen is offering further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the major compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only the fifth of the model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA Motor Show .
and what &apos;s next , next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra compet@@ itor racing .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e stands exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and st@@ resses sporty GT @-@ Version .
in the beginning of next year , it comes as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .

outside , the designers of the noble Citroën Citroën presented above all hand in front of the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was re @-@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was fitted .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , which reduces the number of buttons by a touch screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ play is integrated .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel &apos;s Justice Centre , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are entitled to financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was decided on a decision by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the parties could even hope to pay the judges if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who had moved according to his plans , was found again on the loose foot in a larger cell .
his detention conditions because of the in@@ ti@@ ful detention conditions against the Land Berlin fails to fail .
however , the Constitutional Court revers@@ ed the judgment of the Berlin chamber of judgment and turned the case back .
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber court now decides about the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons were decisive for the un@@ question@@ able period only a few days for compensation for the compensation , it was granted a compensation .
otherwise it would be a mis@@ chief of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber &apos;s chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitutional monarchy already strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
they had only said that in April of a det@@ ain@@ ee , she was imprisoned naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , also the multi @-@ pl@@ ating of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which in@@ mates in a parallel incident , confirmed a decent housing on Wednesday in November 2009 .
the ra@@ cket was over three months away from 15 to 21 hours daily in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in the past weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines as well .
det@@ ain@@ ees are kept once again 23 hours including aggression increases , even on sl@@ abs , it should have already occurred due to the ten@@ ded situation .
according to the Justice of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young poor defect , 19 May 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are producing the &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will be according to forecasts from the German Federal Ministry to Germany this year , according to the Vice President , Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
as regards Germany , the following overview will be communic@@ ated .
according to various forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings had to arise and therefore , the federal government should invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year .
there are a agree to scientists and Federal Minister for Development that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for labor market and professional research , 55 per cent of the poultry Germany can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not even ask for their qualification in order to help them start the entry , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
this is crucial for the integration of refugees , however , to be found in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn in Germany : from the ban on employment for recognition of work .
while there was a working prohibition for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that will restri@@ ct asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society - also because of the lack of lack of evidence - the visibility is made , that refugees should be made faster than access to the job market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the job market are lacking German .
so far there is no offer of offer in general and professional @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
this is why the networking of networks is , therefore , the scep@@ tical view of the world of work .
the Berlin school administration has found that only few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ rained parents , it is only important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ a , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management boards generally distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators have strongly increased by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacity , by reading more technical colleges .
in countries , students are prepared without German language skills in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by full trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , by teachers who only have an qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ams from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German student association appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
princip@@ ally , no Federal State of asylum seek@@ ers or thinking about studying , the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) , however , his post@@ ure has now abandoned .
study aims to facilitate access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or for@@ cements are not given any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers in Germany , if they begin studying .
the latter , basically , no B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G , because they do not fall under the circle of af@@ af@@ ood .
hired refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany so far , to be eligible for B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G , from January 1 , 2016 to date this span at 15 months .
this financial crisis , however , must be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Student Union .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ G .
in future Islam will play a more vital role because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually su@@ stain the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
important would also be the establishment of a Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which is professional to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also includes obligations .
thus , the representative of Islam must unite and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to join him some control options .
to do this , also the read@@ iness , houses against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Muslim Central Council , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts can also be put into force in Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ stri@@ ve such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposes to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more than today a subject of society .
this will also need to change its majority society , bringing the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a succ@@ essive decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders non @-@ tw@@ ei@@ ves German have been calling for a long time and why international agreements are to come to reality in the coming years if the country will remain peac@@ efully , and their new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to don@@ ate medical care for the far anticipated refugees , the state of physicians , named Frank Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , &quot; we are able to do this , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all inc@@ ts are immediately submitted to the registration health cards .
the benefits could be accounted for later by federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to provide so many people with the limited power catalog , to see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors will present all the language bar@@ riers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de found himself worse than their disease wor@@ sen@@ ed with immigrants than other patients .
no longer than clinics , also in physician offices would have to be acquired in medical practices , they are demanding .
this helped many refugees , but also with more gener@@ alized medical practice in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
in refugee camps there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the youth , it is related to HIV education .
in some of the other cases , German doctors from their education became clear , but clearly stated Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite case or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and that which concerns the state , be bl@@ ur@@ red by the refugees , even in sight .
Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , and certain refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice practice , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications and retri@@ eve trials again .
at least half of the refugees in Germany come to estimates by the Federal Patent Office ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most suffer from one post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K , are particularly vulner@@ able .
a recent study by TU Munich prove that every fifth Syrian refugee must be trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who has contrac@@ ted to a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer@@ ers suffering from things to so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and f@@ atal@@ ities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentr@@ ating disorders , strong mo@@ cking and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , early treatment was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ otic patients have received a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill @-@ looking for asylum seek@@ ers may pose a motion for psycho@@ therapy , the processing takes about several months .
in addition , social worker , or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ fortune , says Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe Robert Mug@@ abe delivers a false speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case was widespread over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening ceremony was also clou@@ ded by the alleg@@ ations made by the MPs from the opposition that they were warned of anonymous deaths and had warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe .
last month they had hat@@ ted him and dis@@ continued during his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to grow 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the scope of re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings and savings .
after this year , HP will split into two publicly tra@@ ded companies and part the computer and printers business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and business activities .
the expected employment reduction result resulted in a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; these re@@ structure measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ men and Chief Executive said that the unit is to lead after separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and pro@@ lon@@ ely portfolio of shops that support companies during the transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; is focused on providing , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such as a company &apos;s explanation .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical systems and the Palo Alto Garage man called &quot; the place of birth of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has completed a massive re@@ structure to handle the conversion of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer , and one of the largest U.S. @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on conviction that narrow focused businesses can deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates standing in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation will go according to plan , there is no reason why he could not play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss out at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the great confusion in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly terminated the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ le injury and then returned to its old moment@@ um during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone who did not heal .
that is not a greater matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his Kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries that he had previously .
this may be true from a medical point of view , but how Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated danger of other injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different types of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ amps in the last five days .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight times since 2007 @-@ 08 , which have been recorded most vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ senal believe that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from a violation , you have an important period of time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal starts its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur us next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is turning a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta starts to run .
Wen@@ ger can start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud , instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and players who need to g@@ ön@@ t it , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal are favor@@ ites by Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing fields with the biggest inser@@ tion effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season has been started .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , whereby the Richter scale was 3,2 days .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal moved the teaching of the past season with the Champions League chapter on Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ ort@@ alized , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship festival : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of what the need for men to open , now even dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how self @-@ murder rates exist among young men on a 15 @-@ year break .
in 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the issue , the Camp@@ aign against Living Mis@@ er@@ xes ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a bad life ) 2015 was the year of the man to ask the goal to ask the culture in question if they need them to seek help .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in battle to overcome this challenge .
a current study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , &quot; its opportunities doubled to recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course one must first have friends to work for friendship .
in the age of more than social media , communication with their focus on substance is often more important than an important contact in the answer .
our digital life have the need to make strong , cheerful and successful to appear , even though in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are called ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health of much deeper effect .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can &apos;t really buy happiness .
the nice person with friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but through its personality , which sh@@ ined by interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ug@@ s , Mom@@ ents at the football gu@@ ing in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that males can relate to any case even if they are often back to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of telephone past@@ oral care , it said to me : ... &quot; my listen@@ ers for people who are de@@ pressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
the old phr@@ asing &quot; I come to agree , &quot; has quite a tremendous impact as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status via phone the people in the eyes of desper@@ ation may also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you come to the celebration of the day com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you can sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be broadcast on com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ festiv@@ ity
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to grin@@ d Malmö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani after the fight against Malmö .
Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of its Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French Master to the way , but thereafter it missed a number of opportunities before it finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani generated a head@@ ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A takes a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they do not only want the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ - laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarterly results in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ h@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunities ahead of the gate . he later became in the game against his home @-@ town @-@ team and against the club , with whom he began to replace his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to create and rela@@ xes our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry that we didn &apos;t yet have one or two other gates . &quot;
oss@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , which was a 2 : 2 accident in its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was sent out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian ro@@ g@@ ist was described as the man named PS@@ G on the next level in Europe , when he ran into the last month of Manchester United in the last month , and he interpreted in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network .
but if someone did believe that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic hit one Play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and combined with a five @-@ man advoc@@ ate and two deep in the middle class , a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered a little in attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up sometimes , with some mal@@ formation and bad conclu@@ des , not least published by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was in no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he demonstrated a lot more skill when he brought his players to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , whom Di Maria was turned into a shooting down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the coup ...
the second haz@@ ard finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored his sixth win in the year after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malmö in the game could come back and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result being low before the substitute in Ez@@ ech@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi won a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Transfer to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
the FC Bayern was apparently there some years before the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , which then played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion Champions League winner , two time champion world champion , two time European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old moved to FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to Qatar for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi tells us that he already stood before the start of Barcelona in 2008 .

and the registered office of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; rum@@ our wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason for X@@ avi to change

and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; P@@ EP was told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not &quot; could imagine the team . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what he cared for me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ am@@ playing Season 2008 / 2009 would have been going to X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the overall distance on the La@@ wn , split the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end of the Royal Book of Triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film production
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the film maker Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion on the variety and said they did not need behind the scenes .
during a sequ@@ el of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light the experienced actor Brown already under@@ lines the need of alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you &apos;ll do it with the lin@@ eup of the film and not with the orchest@@ ration of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with the s@@ worn un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actors by The Mar@@ tian sat down .
Dam@@ on and Brown found the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to stri@@ ve to think about them - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is struck by their white sugar sal@@ aries .
the producer of Dear White People made herself for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing TV rights to film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded in front of Dam@@ on comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger via the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space so he can tell their variety - that &apos;s SO W@@ INE that it hurt . &quot;
Twe@@ et earned more than 5.000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ ons &apos; comments come at a point where the precise racial representation in the media stands at the head of the social discussion .
after Michael Brown &apos;s te@@ ens was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black lives Mat@@ ter nationwide and urged the authorities and authorities to charge discrimin@@ ating practices against d@@ ye .
in February the singer Prince was a play on the movement during the launch of the nominated films of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums quietly matter , ( albums still have their significance ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their significance .
in more recent times , leaders of the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , if the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le which will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he had accepted the invitation or by the Pope , he is un@@ clear .
&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
professional sport climbing and operation of Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants who could finish all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the seasonal finale they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the finals .
for the last task , climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was about 30 seconds .
Britain ended the task within the period when he finished the first ath@@ lete , which ended the st@@ ress@@ ful phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero made this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ strug@@ gling victory , still under the shock of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or for life , &quot; Isaac E said ! over his he@@ ap money .
suddenly , as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the Executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , one gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ug@@ s something about it .
he is just so fortunate to have done what he has done .
he received the crowds of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same way when the roles had changed them .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a light season ; the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ anders past Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NO HAR@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ Die second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played perfectly in the target field for Minnesota T@@ wins on Tuesday , Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins anticip@@ ate a chance to climb up the ascent in a play side of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game @-@ card .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to deal with over a large part of the season &apos;s second half of the season .
&quot; all the victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers manager Brad lifting .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two starters , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely .
the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , its first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .

thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck in the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia in the night .

after a su@@ cking on Thursday morning we crossed a striking cold front , which brings good rain , wind b@@ lows and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep spot spread over the British Is@@ les in a powerful Sou@@ thwest .

the hair dryer can also enter into the adjacent center of the centre , and even on the mountains are hurri@@ can@@ es possible of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture at the Alpine slopes begins to stone .
here , there is a rain that keeps up to Thursday evening .
sum , the south of the Alps must be converted to more than 100 litres of rain per square meter within the next 48 hours , following a huge amount of rain in the last days .
on Thursday morning , the hair dryer provided the air , as a result , a cold front with powerful , partly hum@@ ou@@ tri@@ um di@@ pped rain from west to east over Switzerland .

Rome has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of the town President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously named shelter in the park was bapt@@ ised on the name of the German re@@ mod@@ ators on Wednesday .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is honoured again as a &quot; German theore@@ ti@@ cian of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome , near the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the ep@@ onymous was applied by the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , a priest of the Protestant Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded the reason that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live in un@@ seen their faith .
with the square in symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith would be welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of 1510 / 11 .
he received the city back then as a promised sin @-@ fork .
his negative impressions should be encouraged by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther continued with his theses against Abl@@ as@@ sh@@ andel &apos;s split in the western church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that made Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated them .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who now appeared with splendid paintings now .
at the beginning the picture was for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has form@@ ulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and screen .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means of &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , it is quite adapted to the respective themes .
around three years Ot@@ mar has worked in his Bible project for which he has taken a sub@@ jective , artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles , who dev@@ ote topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
as a result , he spont@@ aneously found several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its main focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who argu@@ ed on the basis of painting with the bi@@ ble bi@@ ble .
he interpreted the Bible interpre@@ ts by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus now , in today &apos;s inter@@ relations . &quot;
these lyrics are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nestled between the original text of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , it form@@ ulated his personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden cou@@ sins .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately became a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant rulers .
&quot; once the up@@ bringing was with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls .
&quot; I tried to work out that , in order to bear myself again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second issue is to help art in fast @-@ lasting time again more Stellen@@ bos@@ ses : &quot; the perception of educational worlds is characterised by an advertisement , and that is loud .
Sym@@ bo@@ lik is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers into the pictures , &quot; let them stand , discover and discover what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover by Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands with his images . &quot;
old , not suggest@@ ing that the Bible needs to be fully en@@ vis@@ aged , but the most important , mysterious themes .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on the eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text described only . &quot; was written a picture @-@ Bible .
for Hans M@@ öhler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öhler both the ( biblical ) Language of Love and of Respon@@ sibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ railway
set up space , the company was commissioned to model ground level for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished .
tra@@ jec@@ tions in politics and administration began to cast off , especially among the residents who did not toler@@ ate the railway .
thus hill deported , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permission will enter in October , the First Municipal Council , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , could act in their youth and youth affairs committee .
&quot; I hope that this year &apos;s still visible , &quot; she said .
then it should be started without a &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; when working with the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundesliga was a significant mark on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts on the changing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policies to help conquer the ongoing problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t go on me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in turning this topic into the grip , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet there the Minister of State Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football could , and wants to help .
the decisive turn@@ outs have to put politics .
for this reason , the German football League has expanded its refugee policy &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues to continue until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA Convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
even some states support this program .
already at this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ eine are given a clear sign if they are going to wear on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship &quot; We help the # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; back .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and as they can only , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport CEO Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler told the &quot; image &quot; story ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ compreh@@ ension . &quot;
the refugee drama goes on everybody , no one allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we have soccer rules , no , we have to use our jet force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees that have been so incredibly well , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
for the EM quali@@ fier on Hungary on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed companies had started their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we played , is living in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly develop 300 000 euros in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already declared the whole sum in 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .

the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall at the beginning of July .
after the accident at the stair@@ way at the house of his brother in the US he was fallen down to midnight on a water glass which he carried out in his left hand reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ et , has been married and drag@@ ged along on the road - so he told us last week , &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could escape his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the Supervisory Board of Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Pl@@ att@@ ner said .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old Manager is with the meeting and &quot; fully oper@@ able . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) to come back to Germany in October and continuing the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I understood all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can pass that way . &quot;
&quot; important is to return again if you fell victim . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ C without R@@ eus against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes have made a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europe League .
the national player is also missing the championship leader of the football @-@ Bundesliga in du@@ el with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t go back to him , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday .
whether R@@ eus goes back in the Bundesliga match in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of the pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his trunk to the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in the square of St@@ ender Roman Br@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer team praised the World Champion .
but if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with a high lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood , he will dispute the second game .
the for@@ cing statement of Mit@@ er R@@ eus said that the final step for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League has to be the goal , the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ der believes : &quot; that is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
rob@@ otic cars : government wants a pioneer for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is to be the pioneer of the car technical pioneering .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategic plaque from the home of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which , among other things , sees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated driving and connected driving will increase road safety and take care of less st@@ ems , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries , which will also deal with representatives of the industry .
the strategic source of the Ministry of Transport , amongst others , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and a generous donation on digital radio stations .
a test track is currently being developed on highway 9 in Bavaria .
in order to avoid the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions &quot; and where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
so , Germany wants to have used internationally that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also aims to dep@@ loy a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees human beings as a driver .
when automated driving will take over the car &apos;s guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Department of Economic Affairs , high@@ ways will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
nevertheless , driving less vehicles are likely to expect in public roads &quot; far as far as 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the study by 2025 will appreciate the value added value for the driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving features at its location in Germany by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency , &quot; said SPD traffic polit@@ ician S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
the matter of liability upon accidents and security of personal data , however , must be clari@@ fied .
still the Germans are self @-@ prop@@ elled cars but sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey carried out on the basis of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ sa Institute in order to believe that self @-@ driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed expect to 2025 by aut@@ on@@ oma passenger cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , motor@@ ists in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital composite bitter version , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
in the highway no less than 15 percent could be seen in the highway , at a rise of 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car up under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a quite large fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ seed Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ in that looks great thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who was decorated with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and so he put men in sk@@ irts .
&quot; today I can no longer say that I &apos;m interested in the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , but it &apos;s real , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk &apos; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that the fashion designer he has changed his early slo@@ ping attitude concerning his person .
it was actually he that he would have been &quot; for me sounded a sort of &quot; death , &quot; he said .
when you die , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously done in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dress , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give a gli@@ mp@@ se in the barely visible work of the man whose fashion history has been written to have ever completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the vision is not constructed , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art@@ works that has been operated for much effort : to extract the d@@ olls , an styl@@ ist was engaged for example .

he stands for the first , cl@@ assy fashionable experiments of the designer .
as a child ( he was no good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier .
with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents had not allowed him to do .
finally , he taught the fashion of fashion to himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked to the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it then , of course .
for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the h@@ am@@ ots .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ ush tip as fashion @-@ niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery engines in and to make pl@@ ough about 100 meters .
the embroi@@ dered substances and sp@@ ik@@ es emerged in large amounts for customers , such as ceilings and curtains .
this alone is no longer works , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the E@@ quest@@ rian Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important .
in the time of the Pl@@ au@@ ener tip , fashion played a bigger role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is a number of examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
the so @-@ called Vintage mode , which leans on the last p@@ ens , is an increasing client .
those in the textile branch in Germany do not use niche , is no longer on the market .
by us , they already make half of all orders .
E@@ quest@@ rian Pl@@ auen is co@@ sting with nine other companies a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only them may wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales are broken off .
there are almost no personal business transactions and wholesale outlets .
customers can hardly reach our products in this way .
the bulk goods are now much cheaper nowadays on the Asian region , and almost exclusively through chains .
there is also a weaker export , currently based on Russia and in the USA .
so enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the nit@@ ro@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate engineer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Berlin @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au , at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and tips .
to achieve the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a voltage setting between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories which have to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varies to keep a client base .
some years ago bu@@ il @-@ designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter form the historic snow @-@ pointed tip .

the pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ed master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ le allowed himself to be inspired : &quot; nothing was able to start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ grain for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate method , it shapes the pattern in silver .
many people of the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the US , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in pl@@ ough@@ ing and surroundings , and who want a mem@@ ento .

the economy must be extended to the outside to fo@@ ster growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping at the Tuesday of a group commissioned to reform the reform .
&quot; China should use to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business thor@@ ough , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .

the leadership group has adopted a number of policies , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , total of the border controls policy , to include state businesses ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants of the population .
the statement is created a negative list , identified by sectors and businesses , which will not come into question .

EU wants to double its mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes , and thus makes consumers a significantly higher dose of nervous end@@ ings .
consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate employee in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans in sharp focus : &quot; risks and side effects of industrial and environmental policy become lo@@ oped through , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt , the limits amounts of nerve gas for large fish at the end of the food chain like shar@@ k or wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; European economic reasons &quot; to be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are having mercury crimin@@ alizes today so strongly that , on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 percent of the ranks cannot be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be compens@@ ated for sale .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to reduce the limit values in other fishing from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 mg of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch noted this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
therefore , the ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is thus &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ance man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt .
mercury is a high @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which strongly suggests about the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; already small amounts may cause un@@ born damage of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Education declared its website with respect to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health concern is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly represented by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environmental Affairs , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ be@@ x signed more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount produced in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube are &quot; permanent and surface covering , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &apos;s &quot; had been quoted in March from the paper .
last year , mercury @-@ wide war@@ nings had already been involved in the most frequent health risks in the EU @-@ warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
