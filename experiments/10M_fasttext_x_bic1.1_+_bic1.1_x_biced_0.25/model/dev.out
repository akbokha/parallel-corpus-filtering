Obama will receive Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not really friendly .
the two wanted to decide on the implementation of the international agreement , followed by Teheran to dest@@ abil@@ ise measures in the Middle East .
but there should be a two @-@ member solution for the conflict with the Palestinians and the Palestinians .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been up@@ set for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing sett@@ ler of Israel and acc@@ uses Netanyahu &apos;s lack of willingness to the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama at the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two further wor@@ sen@@ ed .
in March , Netanyahu had given an invitation to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at the Congress of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , which had been viewed as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama .
the speech was not talked with Obama , a meeting was rejected with regard to the election in Israel at the time of the parties .
in an emergency call , professor , to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that his servants would have to come to his house .
lamb it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house , officials found the remains of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which looked on a white blo@@ c , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved Me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who travelled into two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled to the school grounds for 300 miles when he had been shot and killed according to the police , according to the police , e@@ thane Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sig@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that our daily maid employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb had made the fatal emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to give up a picture of what was motivated .
the details published by the agent at the two ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to draw an image from a talented , but potentially difficult teachers .
students told that they were looking forward to teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er said he died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal record .
he himself mentioned a written book from him in his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some clim@@ bs to problem@@ atic att@@ itudes .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver , who praised the Lamb , appeared to be a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any problem for any health problem .
this year he only instruc@@ ts two online courses .
recent changes in employment policy revealed that the promotion , for whom Lamb had worked so hard for him , was no guarantee of the automatic way to establish a Assistant Professor .
head @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he got anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that no answer has been answered .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail again , when he entered into Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol at the court of a house approximately a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner receiving meth@@ eus Johnson .
his car ran still on .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house but Johnson said that she knew that he knew the people that lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb began working in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he earned a doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long@@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said it was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together through mutual friends .
they and their friends were in high school and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar .
he was then the sho@@ al of women .
all girls van@@ ished when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and Pr@@ ab@@ iss have been together some time .
in the emergency call &apos; Lamb , &apos; I killed my wife , &quot; but there wasn &apos;t a certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who ad@@ jour@@ ned with them in the brick @-@ house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ab@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
Oh &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ bre@@ vity , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail advanced three years ago both on a summer @-@ century market .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ t was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er said that he was over lamb and Pr@@ ab@@ bite Night at night 5 September after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the rest@@ rooms and wondered for each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense for kid@@ ding .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , directed the first semester program and specialised in American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a German professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student parliament .
on Tuesday night some 900 people including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community attended a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemorative ceremony on Tuesday night .
Sch@@ mid@@ wife &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial day , while the univers@@ ality clause &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
it is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect the fact that the police had said that Lamb had shot the emergency , after he had shot dead in his emergency , but there is no indication of it that the two have ever married .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre on the roy@@ als , and I perceive that the seat is right next to me , and I realise that Princess Diana is going to sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that lasted almost five years , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate millions of people .

8 Contro@@ ls that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter what some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull over Donald Tr@@ ump from the top r@@ te@@ ers at the p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls showed Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what &apos;s meant for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate investment .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump probably won the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts reported that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys came at this time in 2011 , when Rick Per@@ r@@ ys came to the asc@@ end of Herman Cain , one of whom did not only won a state in the nomin@@ ee process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps Di@@ assets and start to flow up their dollars to pl@@ unge him .
here are some current survey results that indicate that the real estate business p@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Oper@@ ators have been rot@@ ated 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey at the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw a real estate business .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of the 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers hold in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac agreement in I@@ owa has found last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of stupid .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P elec@@ torate GO@@ P would be happy with ro@@ gue as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would have been nominated .
just two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates nearly the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which tell the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing there is excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; delayed &quot; when J@@ eb Bush , the establishment of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be a candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive claims , 52 percent of voters think that the real estate gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to the President , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first country state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to the Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his position effectively , and nearly six out of 10 independent readers say that his temper@@ ament did not take the White House , such as ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when setting up her nest @-@ bag , Republican @-@ dial ro@@ gue are real .
if they are asked , who wins the worst the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say one from CNN / OR@@ C about the past week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since then , when four out of ten July you put money to J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P elec@@ tors show not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination was only 28 % for final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , it shows that a multitude of GO@@ P elec@@ tors Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign portra@@ ys campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump remains almost every one .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ed field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ dump support is spread to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey at the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republican Candi@@ dates , Tr@@ ump is harvested multiple support .
he crossed Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that sm@@ ites him ?
Ben Car@@ son would persu@@ ade the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head .
a prec@@ ept of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half the voters that support Tr@@ ump , say they have their voices be established .
of course , much can be done to change that , and nobody can really say the opinion of changing .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competitors in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as frequent to dump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with tre@@ ump in the subject of immigration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago she named &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ ate was at the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic routine of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans are rest@@ rained from the Republican Party and to damage the re @-@ orientation effort .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with a ro@@ gue in matters of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to do Donald Tr@@ ump apparently .
the fru@@ stration over the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , there are now about half of the support of Republican voters , primarily through their out@@ si@@ der status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day decision of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated over the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ y . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive residential community - with views over the North Sea Coast .
the street is a square @-@ square meter for an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offering of objects is still limited , &quot; says the study , therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which specific locations cost a square meter the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student group in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top neighbor@@ hoods , one of the price is , however , such as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
real estate services angel &amp; Nations has published a ranking of the most exclusive German housing sites - with square met@@ ers@@ lau@@ ts in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several ten@@ ths of ten thousand to do nothing - per square metre .
but good for those who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Go@@ ze
double Tor@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky spot by Thomas Müller paved the way to the FC Bayern and earned the way to a well @-@ served 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran it .
a convincing start of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Go@@ ze have made a dream start in Milan in the wit@@ ch@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus , a dream start@@ up in Milan .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off play in the Champions League at the Greek @-@ breaking Olympic champion in hot@@ ter atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ z bet ( 8@@ 2nd ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th step into series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ew@@ ays after Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was received with his 28 @-@ hits in the Champions League , the Bavaria @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ th@@ aid of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ah Roberto , who was going to happen as a f@@ lange of the World Champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate it , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame was promised before the game in Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is &apos;s stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich visited word .
they showed a concentrated , dedicated idea , without shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won his most recent six home games in the Royal class , including against famous clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled as well .
but Bavaria , in seven European ash@@ up Du@@ els , defe@@ ats Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victims .
they went cour@@ age@@ ous , however , with her obvious efforts , but often too imagin@@ ative .
these attacks were led to often by playing ground on the outside of the Secretary of Douglas on the outside of the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortunate than his fl@@ atten@@ s from the right hemisphere in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion scored the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympic vic@@ ar , Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct marketing , the keeper of Tor@@ wart Roberto with knee should be par@@ ed ( 3@@ 5. ) .
even though Bavaria was acc@@ ust@@ omed to the domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ raeus was able to bet .
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel New was a decree .
like he drew a shot from ide@@ ye on the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola launched a quad@@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to muscular problems back in Kad@@ esh , sat down outside .
the World Cup hero was given the green light after the final finish , he said Matthias Sam@@ er at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
also on the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for his so@@ ot@@ ted Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
I@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o &apos;s Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and 13 minutes later everything was clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made a better .
in front of the game , it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ all .
after a smaller group of har@@ dening Bavaria @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator block evi@@ dently hit the supporters of Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with b@@ aff@@ s against the Munich @-@ mun@@ itions .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
anyone rough@@ out has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , so does not only harm the lungs , but also teeth - that will create a long @-@ term study close .
the good news : if it decreases , the risk decreases rapidly .
smoking permitted a significantly increased risk of losing its teeth early .
the study has long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking smoking , the risk of losing their teeth at the same time was 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 feet higher .
scientists had more than 23@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of g@@ ums are cav@@ ities and infections of the g@@ ing@@ ival , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor which em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth de@@ formation can therefore return to frequent g@@ ing@@ itis in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , unless smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who listened to smoking could reduce their risk within a short period , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
it could , however , take over ten years , until endang@@ ering back to the level of non @-@ smoking , First built by Thomas Dietrich , the English University of Birmingham .
people had to convince humans that are non @-@ smoking , the manager of H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking causes the lifetime . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our identification also to good health health up to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of Zah@@ worth@@ less@@ ness shared the DI@@ f@@ E associated with .
previous studies had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .

EU Commission proposes new rules on TT@@ IP trial
in order to obtain the dispute over the trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private space installations for disp@@ utes between concert halls and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizens , &quot; stated by the competent EU @-@ Com@@ intern , Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström when presenting .
the pig had to set off the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position for free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the world &apos;s largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people will be created .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure applies specifically to select the EU states and the USA together to select an independent judge for a new investment level .
they are to come from EU , the United States , and third countries .
the second instance is scheduled for the first time .
she would allow it to rise against judgments .
until now , the Trial of companies agreed to an arbitr@@ ator , a claim against their judgments .
in discussing the past months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and Justice , who did not understand Malm@@ ström &apos;s consent .
in the long term , she wants to work according to an international investment court .
there may be , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
most notably by large corporations with investor @-@ Sta@@ ats @-@ Ar@@ bit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe .
the traditional arbit@@ ers are crit@@ ici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parall@@ els , through the company pollut@@ ants , t@@ apping the tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in his first reports , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations like Camp@@ act discussed the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ sufficient .
it has been critic@@ ised especially for the agreement negotiated for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary of Matthias Mach@@ ines ( SPD ) defined the plans on the other hand as great progress .
the Commission had taken into consideration for the reform , who dra@@ fted the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ers may be from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned that the economy has to limit the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by it , called it .
when the talks about the Free Trade Agreement TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday still un@@ clear .

del@@ ik@@ ey folk music from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to it , a fli@@ pchart , on which one of the in@@ timi@@ dated folk singer , has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , was virtually caught by Stev@@ ens .
he speaks from different places he always records on the map , where his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and tender arranged songs report .
wherever they were born , and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since that , Stev@@ ens has been pro@@ ving to himself as a wonderful creation .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear to be smart composed and very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time to be great @-@ opul@@ ent .

but already in 2004 and the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; had already appeared and had a positive expect@@ ation .

a year later , the musician is returning to the series in New York .

sub@@ b@@ ating to ideas and list@@ ical fin@@ esse .
the album desc@@ ends into the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual chart of the influential musical media .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens was then serving on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic toler@@ ances .
this sixth regular studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but by programmable sequences or beats , and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall .
the stage shows has long been increased from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are well @-@ made from Neon @-@ head@@ bands and a large fluorescent stage de@@ ko .

he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; L@@ ow@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although almost 2000 guests are now able to sit in its chairs , the clearly bold Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk .
without hearing a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide @-@ released album .
you can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and you can put it out on the bottom . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ igh@@ ter
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns has a@@ waited for tension in the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ igh@@ ter
the new Labour MEP Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo management and made it for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ n will rise to ask about the first of his six given questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance by the media probably and the Labour MPs from the near@@ ness .
he called for &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave his colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ b@@ ying leadership , since it comes to the appointment of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett team and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour Party &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the sin@@ king of National An@@ ne on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS prov@@ okes in the newspaper at the centre of several cover pages .
Mr Cor@@ b@@ ns decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has got attention on itself
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ lob@@ n said he had stood &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; he got the &quot; hel@@ pl@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the Labour Council to sing the National An@@ them , regardless of his faith that the monarchy should abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of sha@@ dows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on dis@@ agreements with the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as leader .
the BBC Corporate correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ des says that political differences may also be st@@ ack@@ ened within the Labour &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ respon@@ dence &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ y@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference , Labour change under@@ min@@ ed to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow of Labour and R@@ ee ministers , said the party &quot; very clear &quot; was that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth @-@ president of the Labour MEP David Cameron , ever since he &apos;s T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch speaker in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised a policy of policies , says that he has given the &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 copies .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the con@@ gest@@ ions of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that it is under@@ min@@ ed with in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ism and that he has undertaken towards serious problems , such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the sha@@ dows of economic ministry is represented , if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he has also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues may occasionally grab the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ stat , the spokes@@ man of the house , to discuss the problem .
when he was elected leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo . but some years later he admitted that he failed .
since she was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the fre@@ eroll was considered the most important Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Represent@@ atives and his position under his par@@ li@@ ament@@ arians , argu@@ ed that it became a caric@@ ature , and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

Met@@ cash starts bur@@ den@@ ial campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale dealers has started a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to an US $ 700 million invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets are increasing their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing of social media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers can jump on board , with brands such as ice@@ berg soci@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distri@@ butes books and sale owners who sell to faithful customers to the South Australian football League .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers , alcohol , and devices will carry out its annual investors strategy .
it is much at stake where South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop and higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in Eastern nations .
South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much more powerful market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - over 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in Eastern nations .
however , analysts like Morgan Stanley is that Al@@ di has to car@@ ve out more than five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets , but will take away all the existing actors , but predominantly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath , by Morgan Stanley , estimates that IG@@ A reta@@ iler could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and Met@@ cash 250 million from the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has established 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and grocery and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s at high fixed costs could cost Met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million in earnings before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same date , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly on Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l of Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the most visited .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s increase turnover in food and market by 3.8 per cent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2017 , will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading guard manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash will probably van@@ ish within a decade . Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash rejected it , public to react on the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass added contact to Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ As market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s have been operating food and food trade , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which is reflected in its operating debt reduction in the same pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers al@@ it@@ ates and invested more than $ 150 million in order to improve the prices of col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and improve IG@@ A retailers in improving their shops through fast growing fresh foods and provide a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and loading programmes on pizz@@ as are expected and hopes that the bulk handling will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Co@@ amo is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ved rather praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Re@@ aly and deser@@ ved the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly in its own way .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , who ever is referred to as &quot; special KS &quot; by Ch@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA .
in a fier@@ y pre@@ limin@@ atory game in Cincinnati , they soon had to be separated from co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice with the arbitr@@ ator , when Harrison who cried : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike and beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen , as he struck a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f turned out a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ chil@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ending from He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is at Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken one ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken out of fru@@ strations with themselves , and I know than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved very well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated with a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 years old , he works very hard and he goes into the team and so on , he has never worked with the other players , he is very good in shape , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to its own studies .
He@@ aly also backed the decision to consider cy@@ mb@@ oli in the important pre @-@ decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right to all , but he sec@@ ures the man out of Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is fully concentrated on the competition and not all the check @-@ in parts in around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I think Nick has very quickly fore@@ seen the asc@@ ension which people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he &apos;s up in the eyes of the public , and he will try to support him , we try to give him the consequences of his action , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains not@@ ion , closes the border and keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency status and locked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all who tried to get illegal into the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land as hundreds of migrants responded well with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled the violence , formed for an unknown time in a district film@@ strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built up tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations have come up .
as a police helicopter ho@@ ist@@ ed on them , the migrants &apos; denied the border ! &quot; and they expressed ins@@ ults against the Hungarian goods police .
some mar@@ es from protest gro@@ c@@ eries and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants should return from Hungary to arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collabor@@ ative damage .
it has to be held in talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ian in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation blo@@ c in a disputed meeting in Brussels , no joint immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who had taken refuge in the shr@@ unk of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hopes that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was concluded that the EU states would retain for more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not bet on a brief action of Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency situation in two southern regions published Tuesday gave authorities more powers to rein@@ force the crisis , so that they could accelerate road blocks and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country has also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Rum@@ ania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after that hes@@ itation has ended at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners were employed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a lot of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East for a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and enter the entry point into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that the most incoming economic refugees are that are looking for a better life , and not war refugees that are eligible for protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight , take over the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ ours that would establish the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . this law also lay down pen@@ alties for traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; on the situation that originated by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains its emergency state , &quot; said Govern@@ ments Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ists in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others had already invaded the country .
they come across as they damage the fence , they are now in custody to under@@ take off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are involved to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos had the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to edit people from people and pushed a crowd of people to push himself .
about 20 succeeded in stopping , but thousands remained outside .
a further group of migrants have blocked the most important motorway between Serbia and Hungary and said they would stay food and water till they arrive to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head to Bern@@ ie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit start in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ anders won her opposite the ground .
it now holds the support of 47 % of the democr@@ atically elected voters as a second time ( 58 per cent before ) , while others stands in second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced nor susp@@ ects he Presi@@ dential candidate for the presidential candidate , receives support of 15 percent of the parliamentary elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the preliminary election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates shall support them .
but Clin@@ t supporters are more resistant than the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost some profits in a number of demo@@ graphic groups during S@@ anders .
Clinton ke@@ yp@@ ts a large lead in women and mix@@ tures , but these jumps have reduced .
her support for the men is notice@@ ably decreased , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
the benefit of democratic voters under 50 years has vol@@ atile , and they and S@@ anders are now at equal height .
Clinton thus has a major lead in senior voters .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit advantage over the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now an 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democr@@ atically elected voters think that they would support enthusiasm in the country if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support her and some 15 percent would support them , because they are the can@@ did@@ acy in the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support them six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters in particular are thr@@ illed by it .
the views are stronger in those who are currently unable to support the Clinton neighborhood - only about one quarter of them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically support them .
while 48 percent of the democr@@ atically @-@ elected voters say that she would support us with enthusiasm , less Republican voters say this above their leading tra@@ cker Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ t is asking for an open question , why they want it is the most common answer that she has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 per cent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ t &apos;s supp@@ orter , Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is mentioned .
approval for dealing with problems and voters are cited as well .
since the Vice President acc@@ uses the potential for the presidential candidate in the scales , 57 percent of democr@@ atically elected voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
when democratic voters are asked for elections who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is on the top .
from Clin@@ ics speak more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice ahead of S@@ anders .
who decides not to resolve the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton raises himself ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with the bet@@ ting in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
in fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters , Clinton identified as a candidate with the best chance to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent over the last month .
bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage , which considers it as the &quot; chosen &quot; capacity , has increased .
however , on the question of what is important in one candidate , Democratic voters call for more information about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month , not a single democr@@ atically candidate , or potential candidate genes under@@ pin the general elections as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates bring good results on some key characteristics during elec@@ ting their party &apos;s preliminary elections .
ga@@ ze review Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong top quality qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best starting with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton tru@@ ely and trusted , twice as many say this about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have a opinion of him .
Democratic voters of the preliminary election have generally visited Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about one @-@ quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
as matters relating to Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal E @-@ Mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister , the majority of the Democratic voters of the presidential elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that their opinion has not been influenced in total .
but there is a total of history in the American public .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion on this happened in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans say that the E @-@ Mail @-@ contro@@ versy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion of it had deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
despite the voters of their party as honest and trusted , it is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the vote have also seen Tr@@ ump as non @-@ honest and non trusted .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes with guidance .
from the six tested candidate , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush , will be best at hon@@ esty .
a majority feels , unlike frank@@ ly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample @-@ sample of 351 households in the preliminary election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son fell back to Argentina &apos;s survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump at country
Ben Car@@ son finds himself close behind Donald Tr@@ ump at the latest survey C@@ BS News / New York Times .
on the two candidates , half of voters decided in the new pol@@ l , and others lose dramatically
Republican voters support nationwide p@@ umping in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS contract that was undertaken before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey carried out on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the pol@@ l also proved that Car@@ son is well en@@ acted at demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ pass tr@@ ump among Republican voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins governor , Scott Walker , who fell by 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ et@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place .
the error margin for the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of rep@@ ublic@@ s in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C pol@@ l , released last week , shows that Car@@ son rises to the p@@ olls - he ends with 19 % support for rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the pump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at an increase in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side bars for ex Neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to don@@ ate tr@@ um@@ ps belief in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .

even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to take warm water .
a private bath in the Americas , with a maximum of 17 degrees , should be a short pleasure .
but there &apos;s no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and the Baltic Sea , this week , the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) .

five members of the Brotherhood advoc@@ ated with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student was filed during a grant rit@@ ual of a student link in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , R@@ ord@@ an@@ ta@@ e , up to five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta P@@ si bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a quote as in September 2013 and delayed their transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and had to be attacked , while he tried to pursue a frozen field on a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained of headache , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ es clothes , google , and send his symptoms to goo@@ dly and Andy Men@@ g to take the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , to hide the utensils and set the bro@@ therhood of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; The Po@@ lic@@ ef Wagner said .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning in his hur@@ ts .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g were repeated with bl@@ unt strength of the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County of Grand Jury found an indictment due to murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with bul@@ war@@ y attacks and the formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to solely responsible for the involved persons , but if there is an organization , which has been officially or un@@ official - this will also be correct , &quot; Wagner said on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood ref@@ uses its affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
the interest rate comes , and the cra@@ cks will fall into the wan@@ ing , yields to bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know how long this will take and how long it will stop .
especially the history for the economy offers only a small guide to the process .
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first rate of interest , and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
thus , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly emphas@@ ized that investors should not concentrate on how it begins to increase interest rates , but rather than the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants may however find that the whole excitement was possibly ex@@ agger@@ ated because of an interest rate .
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted un@@ expect@@ edly by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist in the Capital Economics , in a communication with customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still on low level to the seis@@ mic shock that many seem to be afraid .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historic trends based look at how some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the market last month , interest rate of interest rate may be more useful for a while .
as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase assets from 12 to 24 months after initial increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what is happening after interest @-@ rate fluctu@@ ations of the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market has mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , quite flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.6 % ) , with an average return on the past six months , according to a current analysis , Bob D@@ oll , CEO plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later on the Ra@@ ise cycle and the Return of the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest @-@ rate increases often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions , which had not existed before and could exp@@ ed@@ ite the recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point at the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest @-@ rate fluctu@@ ations have only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , just a few expect this to come and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest @-@ rate increases with so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question , &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate of interest , and all eyes were directed at the Federal Open Market Committee that week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could involve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all @-@ enh@@ ancing cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a Super cycle with increasing fluctu@@ ations in GDP , and on @-@ rec@@ ti@@ on@@ look@@ ers used very quickly after the start of rest in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , because the market is conc@@ ise , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the bonds in bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic course .
hence , bonds seem to change direction once the initial increase is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the Incre@@ ase cycle , the bond yields immediately disappear , Deutsche Bank said .
strateg@@ ists by Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates would result in closer to fluctu@@ ate between longer and shorter bonds and bring a curve closer to the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such climate although &quot; we &apos;re still auti@@ ous to anticip@@ ate higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analysis in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
what &apos;s interesting is Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation expectations there is some evidence that the market has adapted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the income tax is fl@@ atter , credit ten@@ sion@@ ing increased , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the market &apos;s characteristics , if the F@@ ed shr@@ inks its strategy .
in large and whole , companies that will ab@@ ort the larger part of their business activities in the United States benefit from it if interest rates are rise and more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse , since a rise of dollars up their products on the global market more expensive and equally the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts &quot; said in a report for the clients .
companies with a strong balance sheet increased by 5 percentage points after each of the interest income in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital ratios as well as low vol@@ atility in their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with high proportion of flexible interest will be losing most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock play , consumers will also benefit from increasing dollars .
savings could see gains from higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , how fast this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliamentary member Andrew B@@ ingham
the parliamentary majority of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for its &quot; sh@@ iel@@ ding &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly hard to distinguish from commercial rival .
he also zi@@ pped the BBC Music Awards and said it only quoted The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dami@@ en Collins with the show The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims to be a leader in general and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private providers do not do .
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public broad@@ caster , &quot; verd@@ ant , &quot; and increasingly &quot; verd@@ ant from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; ev@@ oked &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also zi@@ pped the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously mentioned examples , in which you actually just have to quote what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competition if it comes to the public live music and education .
what I learn about Radio 3 ? I will learn to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unbe@@ atable .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 , finding new music and give new works on behalf , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; he said .
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder it had to be worked to engage the audience when it did so in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media , and sport under fire , came into the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
the T@@ ory scientist Dami@@ en Collins with The Voice - the musical gift show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it &apos;s not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - &quot; produced on a special BBC fashion . &quot;
he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when it was the next time an entertainment series .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of further series of The Voice in the future , or add money from fee pay@@ ers to other consumer formats .
Internet sales rose during August at slow@@ est , and the Black Friday may be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe that the Black Friday marks the Edition in November
for over one decade the virtual shopping mall has rock@@ ed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
but experts predic@@ t that there are now signs that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new numbers show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales began more than three years ago , when buyers started to start selling their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes a one , and we will probably be able to see that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year turned five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers have left off .
experts believe that Black Friday marks the buyer , on which the buyer could hold its buyer for cutting , making its buyers .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that £ 5 spending is spent a little more than £ 1 £ .
in some products , like television and laundry , more than one @-@ third of purchases must now be conducted on web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of clothing in the inner cities .
Muslims are buried in M@@ ec@@ ca by the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first pyramid in M@@ ec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia det@@ aches the collapse of the vast Saudi Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , when 29 of the victims were borne by the streets to bury them that were killed as a crane collapsed in M@@ ec@@ kas .
dream filled , largely in white dressed , the way to z@@ ap for their respect , when the first of the dead got their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ia gra@@ vey@@ ard .
the proc@@ ession test@@ ifies to the saint &apos;s site , where only days earlier a building cr@@ an passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell to the end of the bed .
bodies were released for funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company Bin Laden &apos;s construction by the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction failed .
the bodies of 29 che@@ ers who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Sw@@ ab@@ am of M@@ ec@@ ca , were worn by the streets .
below the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who fell on his first pilgri@@ mage to the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ass in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials already told us that the H@@ add@@ sch will go to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group could not stand the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said the bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the business was forbidden from abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man went to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , who had pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the H@@ add@@ a , which will be held later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has released no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also dispos@@ ed the group because of no current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes in M@@ ec@@ kas is surrounded by the massive construction site , which is led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been joined by the City of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a back@@ bit@@ ing son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 -@@ s .
the crash of the crane was coming in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgri@@ mage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy case .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 million giant ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to those relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured receive half this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
British employ a tra@@ des@@ man , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe sur@@ faced a rise
this leads to the fact that 200 other screens , which are set off cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , will be opened
King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales will be close at country
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claiming that British will lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who do work in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to the pin of walls , these days you seem to be a minority .
the British employ a more professional tra@@ des@@ man to conduct Home jobs at their homes , so the CEO of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new president of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the tree @-@ assisted chain , said that a great increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her is planning to open 200 other screens to open at craftsmen and to close 60 sales stations of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten commercial decisions in the store will be taken by women .
at the moment , the men were protecting the men .
she said it is necessary to issue the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger into a balance .
in general , half of our customers include 80 percent of their decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of the leading British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , is Mrs Lau@@ ry to reflect the top number of men and women in leadership positions in order to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is the only company to find exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here a important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women to the Supervisory Board .
in King@@ Fis@@ her , King@@ Fis@@ her dis@@ closed a decrease in half year and the sales , after the group had trained the cost of closing of stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
functionality of a@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in judgment
at the Higher Regional Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday , two officials of Austrian volleyball / vic@@ tor a@@ I / DO@@ B must have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public proc@@ ession .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acquitted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the Public Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused began to cryst@@ all@@ ish that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 were taught by statutes of club , and they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
he compl@@ ained to the costs of around 400,000 Euro .
these sports officials are also charged because of financial defects .
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ ory certificate , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the refuse of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence appe@@ aled to the fact that the Association had occurred at any time a asset .
the sports officials would have b@@ illed only temporary damage and the sports club , which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and invested a lot of time and money in which the liabilities were approximately 600,000 ch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in the year 2001 .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : &quot; do we go to the club or set we up ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial market .
he decided to def@@ lec@@ t this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money , put our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said in introducing .
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely ; there must be no debts .
moreover , in case of appropriate financial success , the dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ement of the rev@@ oked damage has been agreed back until 1991 .
it is therefore not a part of the re@@ inst@@ in@@ ability only years later , namely from 2003 , when an increase was paid on the bank@@ note .
therefore l@@ ump @-@ form@@ work and not detail bookings , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and books designed the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused .
why the withdrawal of the association had not been revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not care in detail for the finance industry , it is important to have freedom of debt , so the answer .
when in 2011 , a total of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the agreement onto the agreement for office abuse .
those that were returned , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account was the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted the judge to know .
the survey knew long no response .
then he said , he thought that it was the best thing for the association .
if something happened to him , no one would have knew something from that money , the public prosecutor was in the room .
the co @-@ accused was inform@@ ing that the func@@ tionary of the officials was .
this assignment has been form@@ ulated as &quot; damages . &quot;
why pollut@@ ants ? , wanted to know Judge and Prosecutor .
the first accused he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had a damage .
but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; with whom are you all from the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? , &quot; he asked .
he said the func@@ tionary , he never referred to a p@@ enny salary , I have only mil@@ er money and di@@ ets .
he added a charge of di@@ ets to the club a charge of € 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , added .
the accused were unable to present the exact documents for the early years .
these were , according to an operational test , where everything was judged correctly , no longer have been kept , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ ic@@ ism had also referred to the second accused .
all passages are made in cash , in addition he had to go from his home to the bank in the bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on September 23 with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce for three years , the computer range has become a wide range of jobs in developing further jobs .
the positions of the U.S. computer transmission from Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) has no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer .
this means that the company should be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company shared on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall off the fourth quarter .
the break of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has been completed for three years , and has not yet been completed .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world is observed when the U.S. monetary bank will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time in almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were inter@@ viewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to wait any longer and now , the F@@ ed will remain in the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been around seven years since the F@@ ed interest has passed to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank could possibly leave the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy has a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance , generating only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global conditions .
you have advised the markets to change , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good .
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.00 o &apos;clock CET on Thursday
dead distribution at the Delta State University behind dis@@ miss@@ able debt
after shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague and killed - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I do so sorry for him , &quot; he could make it un@@ seen , &quot; announced the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , associate professor of geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he had shot on someone , and killed some man .
he has said the staff of the emergency call that police had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house which &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but probably o@@ bl@@ amed .
the police asked the call@@ ers of his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police arrived the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to do this .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved Me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb sailed 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police destroyed him .
head @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he got anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ p &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enz@@ y had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there were no information , no evidence , &quot; no proof &quot; for a &quot; triple relation . &quot;
it was written by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that she had been married about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but we stayed friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ab@@ iss said a daughter who was 19 and was destroyed &quot; by the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ t had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ab@@ bite worked online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ab@@ t from the Sun Herald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ ab@@ t , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
the police said , Lamb refused to speak on a certain date on Monday to tell them , &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
when police met him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in this night , lamb passed his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph.@@ D. from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his biography work on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ ros@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group to
Lufthansa plans to create a large group of consolidated .
a half billion euros per year , the Lufthansa Group will save with a better organisation alone .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace alone .
with the pilot work , there are new negotiations .
the Lufthansa is building its business structure and evalu@@ ates the convenience for Ow@@ ners .
the establishment of the real@@ ignment is a result of some 500 million euros a year of cost and earnings strength , the airline shared the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board for passenger business in the future .
the low price for Eu@@ ros@@ ings should be developed as specifically as possible .
in the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will soon be responsible for Eu@@ ros@@ ings in the future .
with the re@@ position , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ ros@@ ings with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 workers was complex .
the airlines controlled the airlines in the Air@@ line Group , which represents a total of 30 billion Euro annual revenue of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit @-@ certification cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the judicial ver@@ ts of this Thursday .
that shared the union with .
the theme of talks should be the glory control for pilots .
according to cockpit , the cockpit was able to result in a re @-@ priced record result &quot; fastest possible . &quot;
the conflict between Trade Union and Air@@ line led to various strikes in the past months .
this is due to the trans@@ itional provision of the pilots the &quot; Wings . &quot;
it fore@@ sees that Lufthansa reaches the Group &apos;s own low @-@ price circuit in the fight against competitors .
pictures of Le@@ ena Kru@@ ger will be seen in the artist &apos;s house under the title &quot; Mor@@ ning &quot; in the south .
in Göttingen , the Finn@@ lo Finn@@ lo has put together a selection of tit@@ ell@@ ular works for the White Hall of the House which will encourage their viewers to be embar@@ ked on a journey .
Luke Shaw of Manchester United can &apos;t play months of qu@@ icker Fra@@ ktur processes
Luke Shaw cont@@ ested the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven the Double Fra@@ ktur formed in his right bank .
while this is the left outdoor defense for wines and exclu@@ de him for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal cannot give up hope that Shaw can play back in that season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno during the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw registered in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg room and is located in the hospital . &quot;
it will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United comes , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the changing cabin he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have double Fra@@ ktur processes , it will take about the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and a suspension of a cub@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rer , does not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red to be er@@ ron@@ ged in van G@@ aal .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty of eleven and a red card had been due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account : &quot; thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back again . &quot;
here : Manchester United er@@ th@@ aw the loss of Luke Shaw by defeat at the PS@@ V
the British Defender has an additional incenti@@ ve for the European Championship in France until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V co@@ u , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this type of injury to the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our player to viol@@ ate one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Coc@@ o said .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in another direction , so it looked like &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel really bad . I &apos;m so sorry for that .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to a hospital - Chris Sm@@ alling - after a f@@ oul@@ play game .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost home .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems , to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 , decided to become Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult vote , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to read my children , since it seems to always have a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
all nice and well , except that the subsequent ship@@ ments , in which Cameron apparently describes the action of the book , instead restored a summary of the movie version of 2012 to expand the new characters and details , in order to expand the quite short origin@@ ary text .
&quot; ami@@ dst the rub@@ ber@@ ted city of Th@@ re@@ v @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , tells her to see a real tree , &quot; read it . &quot; a love story was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that was not susp@@ ici@@ ously enough : the text of Cameron published on the website is reflected in part : &quot; in the silent city Th@@ re@@ v @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , will win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
despite being admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron hears the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy hears , such as the local environment through the c@@ ess@@ ful Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ nau@@ gh@@ ty nature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR status was deleg@@ ated to one assistant who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times succ@@ essively for a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text had probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons Elec@@ tor .
the super camp confirmed that the text by Cam@@ er@@ ons was delivered , but there was no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still tough .
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it &apos;s a difficult task , but if you have selected the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , there is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat on my map .
I wouldn &apos;t exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Site is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ling list , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not wear cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive approach .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed himself as a spin @-@ punch and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , an option for the attack .
the news related to this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as its manager in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer based on results are alig@@ ned .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said that - players are their own chosen ones .
long ago , one would have pro@@ long the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny .
if he hopefully hit further runs of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes out .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss failed his post@@ ure , even if he had not provided good performance , and it is not surprised ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man receives to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th won seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton has the chance to play home and back@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that was up@@ lift was that England began in spite of Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in high shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a striking I &apos;m standing tall .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ eer thing we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very well .
he must have at least the same chances of getting before him , but this depends on the team placement in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een alongside Cook , which would give an extra Spin @-@ spin Bow@@ ler and got four j@@ icks , appeared , and I did nothing on it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and this left hand has already shown that he is a devil Cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een might have got his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there is no difference .
my previous team mate Justin Lang@@ er has played his first 38 tests on the first drop before starting in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he had made three hundred rings at once and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes up in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he has very impressed me as a young man .
people may possibly see its statistics on average 31 with the bats and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no number of backup positions that lift their hands and the train@@ ers opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England , England gave a few smart ad@@ ditions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the tests could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est score of the game , where a wealth of experiences bring with , since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes into the white sphere of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful insert into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and how Mah@@ ela has he insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices may bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even when the messages are in line with the previously said .
coll@@ ar@@ co &apos;s team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some may not agree , but co@@ aches and team engineers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember , as in the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken in easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = dep@@ lo@@ ying Britain from the EU ) might be given to Zul@@ u if the economy grows into a Fl@@ ush by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ du@@ gor@@ ging re @-@ strategy to hold Britain in the EU will fall into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the in@@ gen@@ ious Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ b@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently tro@@ d themselves severely due to Europe on Tuesday .
also foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ate boy@@ ant said that some Member States , as deeply ro@@ ared in different crises such as the EU is now , and not always from own debt , British @-@ even created agenda with commun@@ ed conc@@ essions and distur@@ bed contrac@@ tual changes they are usually not being satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it , unless they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , take a photo of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come back home and say that they allies gain allies .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain in the interior of the EU Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let us not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves out that more and more short @-@ supervised ministers and civil servants come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been working on power for 10 years before it looks bad for them , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) has happened .
French François Hollande can look upon his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a promising strength .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alistic rights government , Spain a left wing .
it is hard to imagine that they will get out a leg in order to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better to prevent their energy from the UK - something they did not want because most of them might have separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies .
hence , some such ministers may not plan un@@ helpful statements , throughout SN@@ P style , while Britain provides refer@@ end@@ ums to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process in 2017 my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has not won any value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how myst@@ ical the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the Oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press department , as it did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can recall Boris Johnson to remind the ore @-@ euro con@@ cili@@ ation@@ ists , who made himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his promises , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
to do this , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ car@@ nival masks , phone h@@ ack@@ ling foreigners , and P@@ seu@@ do non @-@ foreigners who have most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir felt similar about it , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him , rather than going up to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he refused to disgu@@ ise himself as Cam@@ er@@ ons , because Bla@@ ir had refused the principle of the Constitution which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it to him an back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ n , who gave me a friendly ghost on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he does not need any time to bar@@ gain me - seems to repeat a danger of a boy@@ cott , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I just press it - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blonde trend and the wil@@ ful fellow of Tor@@ n Small Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in radio and television that week said when the sc@@ ou@@ ting in him had to admit , not admit that Cor@@ z@@ ily dis@@ appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as secret Chancellor was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father worked in television as an effort to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet mate , without going too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys battle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and MPs in accordance with all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the ag@@ ony bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ b@@ n wants to con@@ vey - remember that he has even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe who allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in advertising campaign for self @-@ compreh@@ en@@ sible such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks about that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ ns fundamental pl@@ am@@ ities for the EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ uous actions to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ ic is convinced that J@@ C does not withdraw a campaign to the outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will attempt to try , in all , to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn to political funds , - they have also susp@@ icious elec@@ tors - to make conc@@ essions to the British , when this can be meaning@@ less ?
the USA are already fairly disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on the power where I was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise public Health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking , originated from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined forces in their report submitted by public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Review &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
some researchers have asked the power rating of the data and referred to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extremely wav@@ y basis , &quot; based on the P@@ he whose most important conclusion was founded .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; to create &quot; stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public claim that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; E @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of re@@ modelling and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were con@@ ven@@ ed to provide a model for multiple critical criteria ( multi @-@ critical analysis analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of this meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ bonds Health , whose Managing Director was to have received earlier by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that funds from an e @-@ cigarette producer , but not the financing which he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarette Champions , some of which include a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line from P@@ he participated .
the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ essed that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , no such connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there &apos;s no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking people . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smoking never dies on his Su@@ cht .
all the evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison with , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has a unique obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what evidence is evidence and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers facing the tobacco .
nearly 80,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .

the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give its right arm &quot; for hit shows as Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fees should be used only to make the kind of programs which are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ caster .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they can be seen public broad@@ caster programs that probably can be seen by a smaller crowd , in hard , controversial time window versus the most popular shows of their Riv@@ age and radio stations such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time for Channel 4 without success with the BBC to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC will present or pass , which was also clearly by subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fee , if you don &apos;t want a good idea in the long term or long @-@ term , you should at least give his production at least for programs , the other hand or on behalf .
you will send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show it is a joke , it is ridic@@ ulous , it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a ruling tax is financed , which could also be subsidi@@ zed without subsidi@@ zation .
the Voice is such a programme , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give its right arm for it .
I need to see how this is to be public @-@ real television .
I don &apos;t think that this would be able to reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC confirms to the hunt for reviews : &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of men who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC will again give what was the former Director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows such as East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal n@@ ical programs to go to BB@@ C4 should not be able to measure the audience , but they can argue that , if they go out to their apparent missions to just@@ ify the just@@ ification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
on the access fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course , think everyone , think that one gets a great value for $ 150 a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ bri@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also told the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to check and enter@@ tain their empi@@ ri@@ ian mission . &quot;
he said , only little from the BBC production would now be official as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take a look at the public broadcasting in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform , clari@@ fy and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV will be shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances go into order to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control bra@@ ins by waves
the video shows how n@@ em@@ ato@@ des may alter the direction in the moment in which they are radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have been bred worms with genetically modified nerv@@ ousness , which can be controlled by removing sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have heard with sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for the human hearing to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
impul@@ ses work through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are being genetically modified to apply the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asound @-@ waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers reported the power of a new method called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , which can be used ultr@@ asound in ultr@@ asound , in order to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ en@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could substitute the depths brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asive procedure which gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of people of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
f@@ aden@@ oids usually do not react to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani knew that when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the b@@ low@@ job , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asound @-@ waves , which then penet@@ rate the worms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asound waves on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the th@@ icker cells .
the sound waves affect the opening of these ion channels and activ@@ ates the cells , which are assigned , such a report nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani is genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ em@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels carry .
when switching ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are intensi@@ fied by micro@@ fib@@ res and commit to worms , where they turn the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities to Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a breakthrough tool that enables scientists to begin and switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics might have some advantages over this technology .
contrary to the light that has to be sent out in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultr@@ asonic axes can pass an enormous blood pressure and can be sent up in the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with genetic therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily dis@@ astro@@ us human neur@@ ons for ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ality Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but now I don &apos;t remember the ten@@ ded smile of those who I have committed - and to the numerous , long @-@ called complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve lear@@ nt , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student houses is enough of easily sho@@ ck@@ ling up to an absolute sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to ch@@ atting : people tell whence you come from where and where you stand in relation to Cor@@ b@@ ite and why you know &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite doesn &apos;t love to love , just because in serious , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were cut and these extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film @-@ night event venues and municipal con@@ jun@@ ctions , but they are also the places where people withdraw and sli@@ pping their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t think about the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted : intro@@ ver@@ ted treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many students of residence cultiv@@ ate a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ blo@@ oming @-@ culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship , but you have to go away so I get back the energy that I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ mil@@ ate of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
fu@@ by fu@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the not@@ ion that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
make friendship with baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ mania , the clo@@ cking is at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile , when I give you some personal questions . &quot;
offer tasty home @-@ made treats is a good way to close friends .
her ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to have a chat and are associated with a great surprise in the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
po@@ or@@ ly missed cl@@ ump out of flour , sugar and fat , people make sure people put sleeping , when you head .
to steal food is an independent crime in student residence halls .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ?
check it with the c@@ ate owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my co @-@ keeper who added her milk a deter@@ sive agent to pun@@ ish ti@@ thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
you shouldn &apos;t make any noise , which holds people from sleep or from working .
it is not just about being a constant man , but that you belong to the tru@@ est sense of this pro@@ ver@@ b which sit in gl@@ ash@@ aus .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours , if they had something going out , drum &amp; bass to make a little qui@@ eter than at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and they had a test in the morning .
they acted on it with still loud music .
when she ended up at 5 o &apos;clock , she left her neighbours even two hours sleeping before she shut their own music and shut down her door , and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would coinci@@ de with the same student residence ?
the vice versa , it would not be wi@@ dening , if you have a co @-@ resident for your future sp@@ ouses to move to her and will have to see them every day , and maybe show how they move up all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but when a hot speaking woman is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to talk a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his non @-@ closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ one when it seems .
a good stre@@ ak is funny , but it only takes moments , until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through safety - but never forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
close your door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but do not t@@ opp@@ le its poss@@ essions to the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Public In@@ fern@@ al operators
the property firm Markus Gil@@ dner relies on the moderate @-@ French corner ental terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the alone mother and the straight operator . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how to get cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old at an interview
thousands of refugees are pushing on the domestic market .
business@@ man Markus Gil@@ ker believes , how rapidly favorable living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing the residential market .
what solution do you offer ?
mark Gil@@ dner : no sustainability in containers or gy@@ ms ;
because people remain in a great part here .
in the face of refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the next decades .
a fully commercial , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs a f@@ ew@@ est place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
it is different , when people work in living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say , it is again Peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is worth € 184 billion , without property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took 6 months .
this is fair .
did they make their plans complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : &apos; I correct my project correctly .
it makes it particularly easy to make it the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the plac@@ ements .
gri@@ ppy and wild .
it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities are missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the people react to their town@@ house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who was accused of making luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t true .
but don &apos;t be off@@ ended the compet@@ itor to affordable housing ?
Gu@@ dner : true , however : we had a boom in recent five years , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the killing mother or the straight line .
I &apos;ll see how to get cheap and well built today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by clicking to &quot; General &quot; type and then select &quot; software update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some are encountered after installation , since they get an error message to make the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is rec@@ eding or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may potentially mean the del@@ eting of apps to make space , but Apple has done it more unlikely through the jo@@ ystick of updates . likewise , it will be easier to er@@ ase this if you install a specific tool to install apps once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charging during the updating , or is located near a charging device , so that the battery is loaded .
if the charge is too low , Apple does not allow the update to turn off on the way , as the telephone could lead to half way and that could lead to a termination of updates .

Croatia : &quot; we let refugees by &quot;
&quot; the border controls are also increased at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
however , it is clear that everyone who wants an asylum application would also be &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; of course .
the supply and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that there is significant signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we do not accept fron@@ ti@@ ers flows , even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government previously reported that Slovenia would continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees among these conditions .
this is how the Minister of Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not look like it in Lai@@ bach , however .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; and rather , the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy .
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already strong , on the other side .
as the Minister pointed out , Slovenian wants not to un@@ lock the borders for refugees .
&quot; each member of the EU must fill its obligations , otherwise the system won &apos;t work &quot; before Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government announced that the first refugees had already been tempted in the night hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration .
the Croatian police captured them in the near corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik always meeting new police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
this was the first thing about Sy@@ rer and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
over the coming days , his country with more than 4,000 refugees told the Federal Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would have participated in the Maced@@ onian Serbian border that previously carried migrants on the Hungarian border to Croatia , dis@@ agreements Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade qu@@ ashed out however , that it was necessary to address certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; said it .
according to media reports , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling by the Maced@@ onian border all the night of some 500 kilometres away by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this may now be , in fact , to ob@@ servers already predicted displacement of the existing Balkan Route Turkish @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border controls &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Internal Affairs , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong flow of refugees and especially for possible extension situations .
he did not see details but he pointed out that Croatia became a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border controls . &quot;
one perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been on this since 2007 , and the EU partners represent a good report on the country since 2007 , affecting the standard border controls .
on the Serbian border , approximately 300 refugees were stuck behind the Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who brought to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os and back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried on Wednesday morning at a local eye and cal@@ med : he keep the debates about Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a very high refugee deal .
one could not tell whether they would continue their journey beyond Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
helper in migrants up - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers had already started to distribute the refugees wander@@ ers in which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still not more spacious mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police informed us that a team of min@@ de@@ ans was sent to the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ Res@@ izes , Financial Prosp@@ ects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery v@@ ans lowered its gain to a full year due to the weak@@ est demand for cargo services and higher costs in its transport trainer .
the company also said it plans to hire approx . 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to change 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share came to more than 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening of Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a $ 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in financial year for the financial year ending in May , 20 cent less than at the previous forecast .
analysts expected - according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the smaller view is increased despite the price increases , which are an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite a higher consideration for bo@@ u transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nevertheless expect to increase earnings from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues , and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; solid earnings if you think the weaker economic conditions , especially in production and global trade , has been considered . &quot;
the plans for vacation jobs were announced a day later when the rival UPS announced that it plans to employ 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as in the previous year .
in the third quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex dis@@ continued 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research stated analysts predic@@ t .
net sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks surveyed analysts expected € 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex received a decline in full Pri@@ ory disp@@ atch , which expressed its sales in its American Express cover .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results by F@@ ed@@ Ex .
turnover increased by 29 percent during the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , whereas the result was a result of higher costs for freight transport .
within the pre @-@ market trade , roughly one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks will fall at $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent of losses for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week to decide whether it is time to lift the lead to the first time for almost a decade .
threatened with them at an end of the ench@@ anting , two @-@ story sitting area , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder of the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and their colleagues intend to set the economic interests in the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ time contract from the congress : maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ affected third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predic@@ t them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented up@@ to @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data from the economy show that it is solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets make it a clear F@@ ed representative to rein@@ force these vol@@ atility for federal bonds , and it is also only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , who was in economics at the bro@@ ker company , Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think that if they were looking for a pre@@ text , not to increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty in order to maintain the global market is enough just@@ ification , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed will do , which guarantees themselves to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently questioned about Bloomberg , interest rate hike this week have been predicted .
financial markets will however wait a F@@ ed , with a key indicators out of only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless they promise the sla@@ v@@ eins , by promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial scores volume exceeding 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy keeps the set in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist said at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences to that time , &quot; he said .
if she does it , &quot; In the explanation they should go very far to calm the financial markets , so that they may not fall into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that an interest rate would be calm down the financial markets , because they were in@@ security about when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on track to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow con@@ gest@@ ion of monetary conditions that would test the strength of rest in the USA .
Y@@ ellen were told in the spring and early summer that in spite of the problems of the Liber@@ als , they would expect more economic progress , an increase of the proposition .
although the creation of job had slow@@ ed in August , the improvement of the job market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to levels which the F@@ ed sees as full @-@ employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly going down under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them in the market deal due to the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economic .
but the financial markets throughout the world came together at the end of last month after China had appreciated his currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average was more than 16 % below its high levels , whereas investors were afraid that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would change the global growth .
the market has recovered slightly within this month , with the Dow now stands at almost 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives influence the market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculations , when you should increase interest .
&quot; if events appear on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the past few weeks would not appear , they would consider in this meeting the re@@ ins , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US bank@@ note .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month in order to get better the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty in which the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main sources of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed Monetary Agency in the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere note from the time leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could hit their monetary expansion &quot; causing turbul@@ ations around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly transp@@ lan@@ ted by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments on other locations , but also advice to other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding for global economy .
her decision is &quot; more Art than Science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of inter@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently do not allow with the economic fundament@@ alization data . &quot;
L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their lead by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions . &quot; despite a limited impact on growth in the United States , &quot; L@@ acker reported .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives destroyed this cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the Com@@ par@@ ment of the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate , and not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe that it should be fore@@ seen the time .

Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy nursing care
the Brazilian sam@@ ic organization SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy in sho@@ cking way women as important as important diet during the breast@@ feeding time . it does this with presentation of images of babies who are jo@@ yed to the breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which provide babies every nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers grows to increase their daily calories by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher calories of cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary supplement which should carry mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , demonstrated that a healthy diet pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the community of Bern@@ ardino approved the building request for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be sh@@ allow@@ er for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ longed gy@@ nec@@ ological building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Ground step forward by step forward : in the youngest community of community , the elabor@@ ated building request was blessed without large discussions .
before that , the body , among other things , had decided to apply a proposal for a subject &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tive &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permit for a special form in the roof structure .
accordingly , a &quot; semi @-@ roof@@ top &quot; roof is supposed to be built .
background of the planning is the designated use of the roof for solar installations : &quot; thus , we got together a wonder@@ fully large southern roof@@ top , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the liberation &quot; liberation &quot; turn again around the roof , which is prescribed for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
in this way , the volume of hall is thus significantly reduced .
a &quot; Liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because there is no &quot; exceptions &quot; plan for the development plan - and the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally b@@ ashed out by the management positions .
however , there is no recur@@ ring project at gy@@ ms : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gy@@ nec@@ ological building at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and of S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at costs about 2.3 million Euros is calculated .
grants are expected from the school and latitude .
the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre series will now be presented to the Coun@@ cill@@ or for the test .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ pl@@ berg Hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees mig@@ rate from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to P@@ ong@@ au around .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the administrative district , the Land@@ lord Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , confirmed .
however , a decision on this meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans should be implemented , almost 50 employees would be working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be changed to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing internal station .
the rooms are there .
the staff that do not go to ong@@ ings will be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim as a work@@ station , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed about the plans .
triggered the change to the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now converted to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
the question of who is to succeed , came according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; fishermen &quot; into the game , which declared itself willing to take over the management from 1 October , taking into action with his team to ch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is considered a &quot; recovery &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the center of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
in the course of the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board is to agree , both houses will lead until then the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ies , which has only 35 beds in the next year , should definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the district had previously planned for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital was completed .
Land@@ r@@ enters J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , re@@ acted rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several reflec@@ tions .
there are currently a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and an Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry accommodation there .
&quot; what better we could not happen , such a occasion did not come back , &quot; said Fischer about the z@@ asi moves on the Le@@ ch , who have been positively received by the employees &quot; positively and very understand@@ ably . &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a doctor for more than 30 years now has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threatened in recent decades repeatedly from closure . departments have been closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more refugees are seeking a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distributor competition on the German residential market has long ago .
more and more people are pushing for a market with the emerging markets and job seek@@ ers from the EU , which is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study on behalf of the &quot; Social housing &quot; consortium .
for comparison : this year , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
the most recent 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live as an asylum seek@@ er in an emergency accommodation .
many links to the housing market , and in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to statistics of the Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers arrived .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only in the increasing refugee .
the study also makes considerable fail@@ ures in housing policies in recent years .
Germany is a residential property that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ ,000 units were living in metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains about the study .
many experienced occup@@ ations therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ voluntarily in the apartment market no longer than the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
the number of square metres per capita has sun@@ k again in the big cities in recent years .
to resolve the issue , the Alliance &quot; Social &quot; housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new incenti@@ ves are to boost the social housing .
thus , the basic tax rate could be om@@ itted , and the base tax for funded housing are limited .
according to the Alliance , attractive tax adjustment possibilities are needed .
the funding programme for refugee camps in the vehicle &apos;s vehicle is already good in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , with 184 million euros in the Monday evening , more than half of the 300 million euros have already been available .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have a free money : Croatia and Slovenia cultiv@@ ates Cor@@ ridor
after Hungary , practically no one gets away , there are more refugees going across Croatia .
Zagreb Agency announces the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to inter@@ connect with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Slovenian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria , and is already part of the Schengen area .
Croatia &apos;s EU country is not a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees escap@@ es to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people have passed over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV RTL radio .
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that came into force on the same day doing extra@@ ordin@@ arily superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; they can travel , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
these fol@@ ks are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however there are people who don &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
Croatia launched the first refugees at the border Ser@@ bi@@ ens on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most of the media reports report@@ edly went from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they were log@@ ged in either by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they attempted to walk along the green border to Croatia .
the refugees viol@@ ate the kro@@ on at the Croatian / Serbian border .
the border strip has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine@@ fields should now rapidly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , there are no more refugees according to the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 affected people .
just before the gate on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws , over@@ coming and damage the border to us as an off@@ ence .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore instit@@ uted in the south Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted sentences ranging up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were met on Tuesday in the newly instit@@ uted &quot; Tran@@ sessions . &quot; nearly all of them - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older men .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees had stopped there .
practically , no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the expired asylum seek@@ ers shall be deported there .
before the &quot; transit one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ c@@ ke only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to get up .
they collected the tr@@ ash , the tens of thousands of people left off the road last weeks .
lim@@ bs were broken down , and one of the bearings in the border was remo@@ del@@ ed .
no one was aimed at the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees arrive .
furthermore , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
to the end of the 20,000 migrants , they still remained in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
regular groups of refugees meet regularly in Freil@@ assing .
Mayor of &quot; Str@@ aus@@ ed &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy for the bridge on Sunday with the premises , when suddenly 10 people stood with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists wanted to train with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had set the railway traffic in Austria on Sunday , leaving for it in W@@ ern@@ stein , the city who immediately offered his help and ran together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before we made our un@@ trusted guests once more , with dog and beverages .
we said right away , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; that was self @-@ evident &quot; for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t leave , to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it was very happy , &quot; the city council .
the stran@@ ded train passengers increased on Sunday evening at W@@ els from a ICE train in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , to follow it after the short @-@ term announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still above the fron@@ tier .
the regional train was put off at the inn of W@@ ern@@ stein on the river Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge firmly combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , previously a two bridge @-@ run sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án must now send another Z@@ ig@@ en to us , is a logical result of an unusual political policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ c@@ ke , in order to help the formation of structures that maintain our attitude , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has officially decorated the attitude of Hungarian authorities in the dark &apos;s shadow of Naz@@ ism .
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ ding of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans faced in the border areas of cha@@ otic conditions .
poultry will also want to realize that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which they had invited and welcome , nothing but a new refugee camp is .
a major challenge shall be a challenge , in view of continuing refugees and the approaching Win@@ ters , to create decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers .
and even greater will be for greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search of 35,000 winter@@ time Qu@@ arti@@ ce
Konrad has helped to do all hands full with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is it true that his word has weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank , to set quot@@ as for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the birth@@ center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already received a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless in Tra@@ un@@ kirchen , &quot; he told of his first success .
even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday were without great host , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Interior Ministry on the other hand , however , spoke of a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
a total of more than 8@@ 5,000 quarters in this year , Konrad , anticip@@ ates an example of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ky year .
to meet the numbers , 35,000 accommodation will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are supposed to deliver the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad .
with the origins of the country , he has already been arrested .
these would have backed him , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born that will be clari@@ fied , as the Church will help .
great expectations are the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator in the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Hel@@ per as we do . &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er recognised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; highly serious . &quot;
in contin@@ ual times , it could not be that ro@@ co@@ er@@ ator must have a certain height of the towel holders or size of the broad daylight .
&quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply to a temporary time .
contrary to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , Konrad participated with his experience .
I am an older Lord , to whom you do not without further notice the truth .
superf@@ icial force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er does not cause the Republic to cause any cost as they stated himself .
their number of employees want to increase it to three or four .
the own qu@@ ist search was not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to open a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz that office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
there will be no opening municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for lodging of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary for those affected by the parties concerned without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says .
however , for an emergency , further locations should be checked up to its capability .
review from the cit@@ y@@ scape to the distribution of refugees within the home country .
other districts have also to contribute .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed ! &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) the governor of Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday , further inten@@ ding within the refugee question .
Seeh@@ of@@ er insured me that the German borders are not blocked .
further travel from refugees to the Federal Republic would continue to be possible .
however , there is now the respective limit controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available .
however , the protective clothing would however be associated with regular journeys to Germany .
with the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question .
now that Austria will lead to its borders once again , is a &quot; logical consequence &quot; from the passing of the Germans .
the next Run@@ tastic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New yard &quot; in the lens of industry is officially completed .
the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T is covered in four of the six floors of office and production buildings and the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Dutch .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up companies of the New yard , and later also to ac@@ qui@@ res which .
from the beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot more : &quot; the next Run@@ tastic is just a question of time . &quot;
around 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , Austria of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
for 60 years , the building is p@@ onder@@ ed by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as a Tech@@ center .
about 30 percent of the 2700 square metres of rest in the building have already been rented , for an additional 40 percent , there is a qu@@ en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ corporation opened second business in the arcade

actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to get a dog .
this project had to shoot the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : finally , it is now getting an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ving for women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting at 75 Euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; I have also asked how to open a store , &quot; he says .
crucial for the decision was , amongst others , that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers , which are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site that only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Region of Linz to sell this trademark , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own Italian roots .
her fashion @-@ interest has gotten Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I dive in most , when something developed and I can show new trends in affordable prices .
why such a woman looking for a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , also the specialist woman can not answer with the same security .
in fact , it &apos;s part that a nice bag is refined every out@@ fit .

the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named an@@ cho@@ ke .

Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for f@@ uss .
whether he expresses an alien @-@ host@@ ile , journalists and knowledge g@@ aps in the international crisis policy - the applicants for the US presidential campaign will ag@@ grav@@ ate the campaign for the presidential campaign .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the wh@@ ist@@ le town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where grand@@ parents are from the real estate of property management .
the New Yorker featuring the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a lot in the wine @-@ village on the wine road .
a 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ town is related to over -@@ zig @-@ corners which is related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that &apos;s something that &apos;s exciting , but not so deeply impressed in her cousin , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has filmed a documentary film about the place and its famous fort of castles , including Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also at word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t put it to the king &apos;s heart there .
indeed , respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit &quot; big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally obtained the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the applicant , says it .
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the coun@@ s@@ ellor .
the dump &apos;s success story started 1885 , when the late grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the property company were first sites in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from this tragedy : her desire to return to the homeland , was in the Bavarian state in which the Palat@@ inate was back then .
he didn &apos;t record raw , because he was once approved without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the Director of the Institute of Pe@@ di@@ ous History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared a film launch .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal out@@ wander@@ ers . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ ated statements of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly acknowledged in the United States over Mexican immigrants and demanded the construction of a border wall to en@@ qu@@ ench illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the p@@ adding , it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote family of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born pot@@ ump , the Op@@ a was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) .
the Creator is reti@@ ring against the Americans , &quot; he is always so short . &quot;
do you think Tr@@ ump comes along ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 year old .
&quot; never taking care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension administrator in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm spoke like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that the Heinz reaches a visit to the church organ with a visit to the church , which was generally well arrived .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
it would be better if he didn &apos;t gain your choice , because &quot; it has such radic@@ als , I do not know if this is good . &quot;
if those who had the time in his grandfather at the time of his grand@@ fathers were in the US , would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ land@@ lord Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and when President ?
&quot; it is not &quot; my president , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the pre@@ sidents &quot; Tr@@ ump card . &quot;
Wend@@ t film , inter@@ viewed for the dump of a long time , have seen 12 000 cinema instruments . in the USA , the interest w@@ akes up .
the Bavarian village of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice @-@ Pre@@ sidents at the German alpine verein , Ludwig Wo@@ cher@@ pf@@ enn@@ ig@@ y , the 1800 inhabitants in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden got the award for soft tourism in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain lo@@ ger@@ s@@ ander . &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the Alps is in charge of the award for the award .
a &quot; Mountain@@ e@@ ering village &quot; may have at most 2500 residents .
at least one fifth of his surface must be exp@@ elled as a sanctuary .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , the loss of leadership in the Today Show .
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson face Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als but it has no large shifts in the ratings for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast from the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Or@@ bull was granted the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Cook and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , set up in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise posted an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to Today No. 33@@ ,000 .
today Today it achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but its number remained behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today Today , the gap in sunrise closed in the past few months .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators on Today for Today .
this is the most interesting thing happened every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of rep@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recently de@@ dowed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive number of 219 million viewers .

the last three voices are convic@@ ting : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably won &apos;t know who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s , was covered in sec@@ rec@@ y sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be giving , whether they are the one who received the last Rose .
but when we , with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows on the day , before they come out of three , they may have acci@@ dentally put a note on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left out on ly@@ rical ways , why wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive approach as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , when the question is asked , &quot; If you do , who ought to get the last Rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game destro@@ ys who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except yourself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I felt that it was quite compatible and I thought that it was quite in@@ compatible , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet on Earth , making it so much fun with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay also said that the last week &apos;s visit made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; once I saw it with my friends and the family , I realised that this is obviously not only a game - I am now subject to it , &quot; she said .
and when asked where Wood should be asked , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be at Ten : 30 p.m. on Wednesday , Friday 19 : 30 .
originally as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the U.S. - and there were many other teams who sent requests after their impressive training day at the end of the year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have banned him on the rest of the game when he lost a little angel as he did as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ Liga @-@ Conver@@ tible on Tuesday with his first pun@@ t Return on Tuesday with a 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne &apos;s next opportunity to a Pun@@ t Return and in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula remains his true face in the changing cabin by the game .
instead of being able to grin@@ d the team from the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula reinforced Hay@@ ne on public in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ eper was also encouraged by Special E@@ am coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his failed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ anced with a pun@@ t who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it certainly was not the start to Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian descent for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not present themselves worse to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and this is it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ward compared the itzer with his debut at the time in 2007 when a passport contributed to a T@@ ry for Queensland with his own in @-@ go@@ al area .
nevertheless , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; it goes no further , we have to say about the causes , &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor .

for that reason , Ai@@ w@@ anger has also demanded more staff for the management courts , which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum conver@@ ters , &quot; ai@@ b@@ anger .
the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistently alig@@ ned : &quot; we need to national standards of the German states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts outside , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to act whol@@ es@@ ome . &quot;
but the country &apos;s policy is due to fall among the table .
a years of durability remains on the agenda : image policy .

but this is not far enough .
&quot; the theme of the G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW boss .
we demand freedom of freedom for all the high schools that want this .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police had failed in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a official officer said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu City .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers were assembled outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and burn bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police wag@@ ons Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before she res@@ aw through g@@ aps .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the Gum@@ immig@@ rant , known from those who are known to kill , but traditionally used as a less fatal form , obviously a so high rate of death produced .
the dispute was the last week of violent protest in Nep@@ als , southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ re@@ juven@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the Eth@@ nic Group of the Th@@ arus that would like to state a state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent cl@@ ashes since the year 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed a agreement signed in the country on four major political parties - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , the age of centuries .
since 2008 , the work on a new constitution is on its way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature en@@ forced this week of certain cl@@ auses in the Constitu@@ ent Assembly in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

Google will start dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL , O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign to bring about 11 million US $ for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees escap@@ ing to the European nations since they flee from war and allied countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of his donations in his blog .
instead of leaving a manager to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee that had fled with their family from Kabul when she was seven years old , had her personal experiences .
&quot; in our journey many dark red and bus trains , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ate for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations raised up to € 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / person@@ er@@ board to be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has marketed more than 4 million people this year .

report by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; arrangement by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily overweight diabe@@ tics may be helpful for weight loss surgery .
the advantages of losing weight loss in weight @-@ oriented people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data needs a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert for weight loss surgery which wrote a leading article in the new trial in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to accom@@ o@@ date food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas surg@@ eries have proved effective for treating type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been conducted among people who are disease @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight compared to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI of those who underwent surgery sun@@ k from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI with the non @-@ surgical treatment treatments were approximately equal to 29 .
among those dealing with a surgical procedure , in 36 % the diabetes condition dissolved itself completely and at 28 % .
in the medical @-@ treated group the diabetes completely dissolved itself in one percent in comparison to the diabetes and partially only about two percent .
moreover , the results in blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols in general , were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors .
the researchers also supervised the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood glucose levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held at 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - how you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ished the mortality in five years , the leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also aff@@ ection@@ ate average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached bigger decl@@ ines in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study severely affected by a study that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was conducted with obesity , about 29 per cent less likely to die in a 15 @-@ year period - compared to a group which tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for individuals who have a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously when the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , having associated with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ ing really hard . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not include all the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end the violence against refugees in the Syrian refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visiting in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics studies .
he promp@@ ted that , in the given circumstances , the interests of humanity must be set before the interests of individual Nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ized that the response to West European countries was ad@@ mi@@ red on the refugee crisis , but the situation isn &apos;t appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama was Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to negoti@@ ate the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never replaced these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented George Bus@@ h@@ s &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and found out that the US violent dealing with the US was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after the 11th September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he was crow@@ ned with violence , and that was imp@@ acted positive consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four times increase of in@@ gest@@ ion of disinf@@ ection by children in the past 4 years
poison gas Centers in the USA will report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which makes strongly alcoholic drinks , so the Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues increased by hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , which are attributed to poison control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children always come more often to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go out in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children do disinf@@ ect@@ ant down , while some do it to im@@ press their friends , or because of a mutation of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how te@@ ens disinf@@ ect@@ ant only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ quality mou@@ th@@ wash to maintain a harder drink .
younger children can be sc@@ aled by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are up@@ set .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange duc@@ ts which are very appe@@ aling to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
few injec@@ tors can even lead to alcohol pois@@ oning from very young children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the pois@@ oned centre at the Hospital of Kansas University , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so you wouldn &apos;t stand ar@@ dens Whisky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from a strawberry du@@ ck @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was put into an emergency intake .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold who has been legally dr@@ un@@ ken by adults , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor &apos;s doctor who treated her at G@@ w@@ h Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
she ha@@ sted her words , and was not able to go to her as she arrived in the emergency .

the lack of title trials in the Scottish football bo@@ red precipitation - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ cker mid@@ fiel@@ der and earlier National players in the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , since there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .

D@@ eila said : &quot; Cel@@ tic had already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly as - but we &apos;ll have to go on .
we really need Cel@@ tic support , because that makes the players better .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May until July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had risen by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the figure of 5.5 per cent , as the figures for the National Stati@@ stical Office ( dating only ) showed .
in the meantime , employment fell to Scotland by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the latest figures , the state Secretary for Scotland , David Mund@@ el said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland met the historical decision to stay part of the United Kingdom .
over these 12 months , we have further improvements to the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why am I to be witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agree .
when the day was approaching , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications available as places available , will take place a real lot@@ tery to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will watch it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone data and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh about when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ep@@ ad and take a pin to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has accused me on Twitter to give up my parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the men , as he wants it , and you receive access .
I compl@@ ained of it with her .
she admitted that &quot; it could have better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international rep@@ orters to be present there in order to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work is against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the show of Podcasts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would do him to his action .
but I believe there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can turn .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man &apos;s un@@ necessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to hit him and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tries to install a spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to end the race immediately .
he raised to the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ acy section of the racing Victoria and asser@@ ted that she has a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai on Wednesday for a race session treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing , and he himself found himself in difficult conditions as it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ horses at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had held 18 months for the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations , and did not want to see it as a wil@@ dly hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I did eat for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .
they know that it &apos;s wide .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home this evening and sleep well .
I want to walk up the main church and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had considered the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the quality department had attempted to sp@@ ying out its stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked him to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a bet@@ dec@@ or .
if that is the case , they should definitely deal with their n@@ oses , because they were trying to hold me , failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . aired by Route L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of Route L , and Bernard Sa@@ undry , the current CEO of Route L , were aware of it at the time and are still today .
should I bring it to the view , that it is personally ?
does the RV@@ L have the holidays and are responsible for people outside of train@@ ers to do what &apos;s happening in the industry ?
am I too bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think out there I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I am at the point now , to which it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the vehicle levels of the train@@ ers have set up a cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i with the long lasting Cob@@ alt study , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could have his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ riv@@ alled Master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack was worn out of mud or clay to the horse &apos;s plane , which viol@@ ates the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I have to accept the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my staff has gr@@ ati@@ fied mud on the leg .
it could have been that evening .
it would have been like that , last day , what was like that .
but it had it that day on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack . an inquiry into the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people , who set up this rules , do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all saw that we need rules , but here you went too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy suggests ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations on ring@@ es
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee has allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring@@ keeper &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Bennett made a scar@@ c@@ ted note about the Storm team after his team had reached the Final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the Game &quot; sample example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ endant from his team and said that they were solely foc@@ uss@@ ed on their &quot; contact &quot; with the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers on his team were speaking to it , since it was de@@ emed that they were worried about to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it always shows up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson looked over against ring competitions , when she beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years and he obviously had a great team to train . therefore he is therefore not to lose it , so it was a little shock for him .
it is funny , as it comes to the current time of this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked his ment@@ or idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and commemor@@ ates his ment@@ or to his ment@@ or . St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed as a boring team in 2010 , and Wayne said that he will take care of divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we look as exciting , in particular its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you &apos;ve got this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants to play all his kind of football - not each team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , making them how they play .
I build stronger confidence because they are saying these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t remember that when it went to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters have recorded a higher result than the game of Bron@@ co to Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are there breaks , and do not have a d@@ elling ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they are mentioned , it means that we will be able to meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has free this weekend since they have won the right , either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ula Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday tomorrow .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit to drug ad@@ age
a man who may possibly be sentenced to life for a lifetime of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which hit the Queensland a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug at the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the Marina in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for an attempt to own a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there is no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café from a harmless grounds could have been .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the risk of escap@@ ing at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations to Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of punishment , he lied the police on his where@@ ab@@ ort .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ h &apos;s mother and step@@ mother had offered a $ 200,000 deposit as security , to reach his event@@ ual release .
&quot; after reading the effective explanations of these two persons it is clear that the circulation of a 200,000 dollar &apos;s guarantee represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan .
but this alone will not go out to not release him , warning .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was set free against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he reports to his Australian and his Serbian Pass to call the police daily and returns to an initial cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone used by girls to draw strings to the sending of images
a ped@@ oph@@ iles used the phone for a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl as she was asleep , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of un@@ decent paintings of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up and discovered the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ g .
she saw it , conf@@ using messages , and al@@ ar@@ ming immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web @-@ resear@@ ches , the terms for searching for un@@ demanding images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed responsibility against the officials , that he would have done it as it was to &quot; ma@@ th@@ oph@@ ile in the internet . &quot; and he then , &quot; to be a polic@@ eman , to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
as a lawyer in Ei@@ li@@ ie Robertson , he said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction - that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searching for the computer of him was done , but said it was done as he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent his pictures and he asked him to send more photos .
he said he did it to attract them .
he said he was sick , in his head when he drinks , and said , he would then see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson adds : &quot; when the girl had found the news on the phone , she called her mother , and was at the trem@@ or and weeping .
she then looked at the bare pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computers and Playst@@ ation used to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded not guilty to the charges against the indictment , an independent images of children on the 14th of June , which was issued against the extradition hearing on 25 January this year , and did not appear before the court appearance at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g will not appear in the register of sexual crimes , since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element is &quot; in his fault .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael rebu@@ ked the verdict until October to obtain background reports about social work .
in this case , H@@ og@@ g was granted damages but was given by hear@@ ings on other pending cases in custody .
he was still admitted by the date of judgment in the directory of sexual crimes .

the sun finally leaves the sun a bit longer .
it explains : every two years the makers show their new products at the International Motor Show .
in 2015 , mainly the movement offered by the compact cars , which currently sells particularly well .
at present , cars from the compact class are currently more popular : around 28@@ .1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment , according to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation stage 17 - 27 September ) .
this year , we presented numerous new compact models among all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new high @-@ class cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German motor@@ ran@@ es is the Opel Astra , who will be marketed in the fall of the dealers .
&quot; the Astra is an important model for us , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann appeared at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
to ensure that the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra is now not much more expensive .
Opel is launching an entry into the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf , which kicks off at around 650 euros .
the current Astra is priced at 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , Hessen is offering further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines as well .
unlike the major compet@@ itor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only a fifth of the Opel Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA ( International Motor Show ) .
and what &apos;s next , next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e &apos;s racing .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e stands exclusively as a five @-@ door @-@ door in a conventional and st@@ resses soli@@ dly GT @-@ Version .
in the beginning of next year , it comes as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ off@@ spin wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its damaged lines are fully integrated into the design line of the brand .
the base model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including an newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine with an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) according to the manufacturer data .
sales launch of the Bal@@ ac in Europe in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed , the compact class DS 4 , which is exhibited at the International Motor Show .
the exterior designers of the precious Citroën Citroën presented above all their hands : the radiator gr@@ ille was re @-@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was drawn .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , with the number of buttons by a touch screen and for the first Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition to the IAA , a range of over@@ working and new variants were also available in the compact car like the emerging Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human
the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Te@@ gel &apos;s Justice Centre , which is housed in a small cell in months .
because of the violation of her human rights , prisoners did not claim liable for financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was decided on a decision by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the suffer@@ ers can then say to the judges , even if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with about five square meters between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who had moved according to his plans , was found again on the loose , in a larger cell .
his detention conditions because of the dramatic conditions of detention against the country Berlin fails to fail .
however , the Constitutional Court revers@@ ed the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Justice and rejected the case for a new trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber court now decides about the amount of the compensation
even if legal reasons were decisive for the un@@ question@@ able period only a few days post@@ pon@@ ed for the compensation was a compensation , it was said .
otherwise it would be a mis@@ appropri@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber court must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitutional monarchy already strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they only said in April to a prisoner of damage , because he was imprisoned in a cell in the naked cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , also the multi @-@ division of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which in@@ mates in a parall@@ el@@ pan , in@@ treated a decent housing on Wednesday in November 2009 .
the ra@@ cket was over three months away from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come into the head@@ lines in recent weeks , too .
cap@@ tives are therefore considered to be 23 hours including aggres@@ si@@ veness , even if it is already too ra@@ ck@@ ering . it is due to the s@@ ooth@@ ed situation .
according to the judicial field , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young mal@@ od@@ ine def@@ enses , 19 May 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - German Chancellor is determined to embrace it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are going to be according to the forecasts of the German Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to include a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) has demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again , &quot; We can do this and we can do that . &quot;
as regards Germany , the following overview will be communic@@ ated .
according to different projections of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) flats annually - for the next five years .
it is almost twice as much as build before ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to arise and should invest in funding of 6.4 billion each year .
as a result , scientists and Federal minist@@ ries are agree that there must be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for labor market and professional research , 55 percent of the poultry sector in Germany can be employed in the long term .
the refugees in Germany would not even ask for their qualification in order to help them start their entry , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if you find jobs in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the recording group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the thr@@ ill , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn from employment for refugees to recognition of work .
while it was previously prohibited for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces , the asylum seek@@ ers was limited to a residence .
in society - also because of lack of expertise - also reduced the visibility , refugees should be made faster than access to the job market .
a big hur@@ dle for access to the job market is missing German .
so far , there are neither any offer of competition speci@@ alizing in general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts .
therefore , the network of networks is , therefore , the view from Thr@@ än@@ hardt to the p@@ inn@@ acle for labor integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ ec@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ rained parents it is only really important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ a , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the managing plots spread in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators are heavily devast@@ ated by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacity - by reading more skilled workers .
in countries , students without German language skills are prepared in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by full trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ aps from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German student body estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
princip@@ ally , no state of asylum seek@@ ers or thinking the study - the only exception was to date Berlin , inside en@@ ens@@ ator Frank H@@ ousing ( CDU ) now has given up his position now .
study Speci@@ es refugees to be facil@@ itated access to the university .
because refugees with a residence or for@@ cing shall not receive any benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers in Germany , if they begin studying .
the latter , basically , no B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G , because they do not fall under the circle of af@@ i@@ bn .
quota refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be entitled to ban B@@ Af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to date this span at 15 months .
this financial crisis , however , must be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student body .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ G .
in future Islam will play a more vital role because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually su@@ stain the same rights as they have the Ch@@ urches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
the establishment of a Islamic welfare part , which is professional to the new@@ com@@ ers , would also be important .
at the right hand also obligations belong .
thus , the representative of Islam must unite and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to put some control options to them .
this also includes the willingness , houses to act oppos@@ ing religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the leader of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek held on Thursday the concern and religious conflicts can be carried in after Germany .
those who wanted to au@@ stri@@ ve such conflicts in Germany &quot; have immediately her right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposes to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more than today a subject of society .
this will also need to change its majority society , bringing the mining of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a succ@@ essive decade a anti @-@ discrimination station and an overview of the Gender Equality Act .
but it also lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ ship showed , in the police and authorities just ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders non @-@ tw@@ ei@@ gh German have been calling for a long time , and why international agreements are to be taken into effect in the coming years if the country will remain peac@@ efully , and their new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to don@@ ate medical attention to so far , that state @-@ owned member Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery says .
&quot; what Man@@ o@@ Power and Capacities is concerned , we do , &quot; he said the daily mirror .
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all grand@@ sons are immediately attached to the registration health cards .
furthermore , services could be accounted for later by federal states .
and long , it is highly question@@ able to provide so many people with the limited power catalog , to see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors will present all the language bar@@ riers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de demonstrated to employ migrants worse than their disease as other patients .
translator costs not only in clinics , also in physician offices would have to charge their interpre@@ ting costs .
many immigrants can also be helped with more general medical points in the emergency ambul@@ ances already .
and with another diagnostic look .
under refugee camps there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the young@@ sters it is related to HIV En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with some of the other productions of the German doctors from their education , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes , but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite case or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and that which concerns the medical relief , in view of the refugees , perhaps in sight in sight .
Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , and certain refugees are even doctors .
to practice pract@@ ising , they would have to prove their quali@@ fications , and be bl@@ ur@@ red again .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) estimates more psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from one post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or under depression .
in particular , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K , are particularly vulner@@ able .
a recent study by TU Munich demonstrated that every fifth Syrian refugee family is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who suffered from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer@@ ers suffering from things to so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and f@@ atal@@ ities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe trem@@ ble and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , early treatment was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick people have got a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill seek@@ ers may pose an application for psycho@@ therapy for psycho@@ therapy , the processing usually lasts for several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would not decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to in@@ correct entries , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; Size@@ Clo@@ thing with world @-@ fla@@ ir , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst to his concept .

the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
it will appeal to the Cuban p@@ airing with the heroes of the St@@ umm@@ ers .

Zimbabwe Robert Mug@@ abe performs a false speech in parliament
Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case was widespread over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening ceremony was also clou@@ ded by the alleg@@ ations made by the MPs from the opposition that they were warned of anonymous death threats to support the speech of Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ hr@@ ase .
last month , during his speech she had rested for him and his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions politicians have received messages on their cell phones , who warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ it .
the message comes from a number that will not appear , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mug@@ ab@@ it &apos;s speech .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is able to disman@@ tle 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to grow between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in the company &apos;s restructuring and savings effort .
during this year , HP will split into two publicly tra@@ ded companies and part the computer and printers business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and business activities .
the expected beginning of job reductions to over $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; these re@@ structure measures will enable a more competitive low cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive said that the unit is to lead after separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is smaller and more focused on the HP today , and we have a wide and pro@@ lon@@ ely portfolio of businesses that support companies during the transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and , &quot; an integrated technology solutions for companies have been concentr@@ ating , &quot; this is an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company , founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electric installations and the Palo Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive re@@ structure run to handle the conversion of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer , and one of the largest U.S. @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that strongly focused businesses can perform better performance .
the ar@@ senal Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb in the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed from Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and when his rehabilitation after schedule , there is no reason why he could not play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate per@@ ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old moment@@ um during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone which does not heal .
that is not a matter of matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ uck@@ les or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be from purely medical point of view , but how Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the corresponding threat of other injuries , always when a player tries to return home in the middle of the season .
it also develops a un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd marks 23 different types of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he has also played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 dynamics in the last five periods .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they had been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight times since 2007 @-@ 08 , which have been recorded most vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but ar@@ senal estimated that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come from a violation , you have a fold period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the kind he deser@@ ved .
Arsenal starts its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur us next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is turning a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta finally have to start .
Wen@@ ger can start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud , instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep balance and players who require a small bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
while Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , passed by Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing fields in Europe with the biggest ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
the stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday night , whereas the Richter scale was 3,2 days .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal passed the teaching of the past season with the Champions League &apos;s surrender against Monaco , and managed by far @-@ away hope to manage the association for its first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is imm@@ en@@ sely , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship festival : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of what the need for men to open , now more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how self @-@ murder rates exist among young men on a 15 @-@ year break .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men ranging from 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ r announced ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a bad life ) 2015 than the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture in question of seeking support if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study on more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient proportion of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; its opportunities doubled to recovery .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course one must first have friends to work for friendship .
in the age of more than social media , communication , with their main focus on substance , is often important in the answer of the answers more important than an important contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun , and successful to appear , even if the isolation is domin@@ ating isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are called ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything on cost in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health care .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can &apos;t buy luck .
the nice thing with friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character is not defined by his work , but through its personality , defined by interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ug@@ s , Mom@@ ents during the football stri@@ cken in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to any case even if they are often rest@@ ra@@ ining to explore fully their feelings .
as a contribut@@ or to the telephone branch she stated : ... &quot; my listen@@ ers for people who are de@@ pressed and compl@@ ac@@ about , really clearly showed me how the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
the old phr@@ asing &quot; I come therefore agree , &quot; has an enormous impact as the feeling that it is perc@@ ep@@ tible to weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men @-@ friendliness .
so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status on the telephone the people in ey@@ eb@@ rows of despair also may help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you come to the celebration of the day com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with celebration of the day totally new setting , why don &apos;t you pick up your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you can sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be broadcast on com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria met to help PS@@ G to grin@@ d Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani after the award against Malmö .
Maria meets his debut in the Champions League at Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh Cav@@ ani took place when Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ ney on Tuesday .
di Maria , less than four minutes after the start of its Champions League , kicked off as PS@@ G players who brought the French masters to the way , but thereafter it missed a number of opportunities before it finally increased their lead , when Cav@@ ani generated a head@@ ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also required a strong start against the Swedish masters , since they are not only aiming at the qualification for the K.@@ - and @-@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarterly results in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class example of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ h@@ ov@@ ich missed opportunities ahead of the gate . he later became in the game against his home @-@ town @-@ team and against the club , with whom he began to replace his illustr@@ ate career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to create and rela@@ xes our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry that we have not yet scored one or two other gates . &quot;
desper@@ ation returned to Paris after his injury to the Paris @-@ Team , which ended on the weekend of a 2 : 2 accident on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was thrown by Paul Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian wing @-@ wing was described as the man called the PS@@ G to take over the next stage in Europe , when he ran into the last month by Manchester United in the last month , and he interpreted in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he finished along to Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network .
however , if someone did believe that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nation@@ alists on the field and combined with a five @-@ man advoc@@ ate and two deep in the middle class , a heavy opponent .
but apart from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ is j@@ ic by a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they pe@@ aked in a little attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up sometimes , with some patches with flaws and bad agreement , not least published by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was in the first half in the first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he demonstrated a lot more skill when he brought his players to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , whom Di Maria was turned into a shooting down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post .
the second haz@@ ard finally fell shortly after the hours @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored his sixth win , after that : him@@ elech trem@@ bled a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all thoughts on that Mal@@ mo can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result being low before the substitute in Ez@@ ech@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi won a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later announced that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the FC Bayern obviously stood before the commitment of Spain super@@ star X@@ avi , which then played for FC Barcelona at that time .

Matt Dam@@ on presents diversity in film production
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the film maker Eff@@ ie Brown on a discussion on the variety and said they didn &apos;t need behind the scenes .
during a sequ@@ el of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light the experienced actor Brown who emphas@@ ized the need of alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected scrip@@ tw@@ rit@@ ing of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the orchest@@ ration of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with the s@@ worn un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the commentary of the actors of The Mar@@ tian dis@@ counted themselves .
Dam@@ on and Brown found the producer of Ben @-@ Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to stri@@ ve to think about them - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is struck by their white har@@ lot .
the producer of Dear White People have chosen for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing TV rights to film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the debate has been on , social media explo@@ ded due to Dam@@ on comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni appe@@ aled his anger via the clip , saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space so he can tell their variety - this is SO W@@ NO@@ WS that it &apos;s hurt . &quot;
the Twe@@ et earned more than 5.000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ ons &apos; comments come at a point where the precise racial representation in the media stands at the top of the social discussion .
after Michael Brown &apos;s te@@ ens was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black lives Mat@@ ter nationwide and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to charge discrimin@@ ating practices against d@@ ye .
in February the singer Prince was a player to play the movement during the launch of the nominated films of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums quietly , &quot; ( albums still have their significance ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their significance .
in more recent times , leaders of the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , if the group should be considered a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le which will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or the Pope has already taken the pop@@ e , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
professional sport climbing and control leader Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants who could finish off all levels of his obst@@ acle @-@ course .
during the seasonal finale they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the finals .
for the last task , climbing on a 75 feet long climbing rope was about 30 seconds .
Britain ended the task in time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the most demanding phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds ahead of making him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ strug@@ gling victory , still under the shock of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean , it is ast@@ oun@@ ding to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or for life , &quot; Isaac Newton said ! about his he@@ ap money .
suddenly , as I can &apos;t imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the Executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all , did not receive any prize money .
following the rules , money is concerned about the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , one gets the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ug@@ s something about it .
he is just so fortunate to have done what he has done .
he received the masses of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same way when it changed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a light season , which will start fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ander to Minnesota T@@ wins
NO HAR@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ HAR@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ Rec@@ over the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played perfectly in the Minnesota T@@ wins again on Tuesday , Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins w@@ asted a chance to climb up the ascent in a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game @-@ card .
for Detroit , even though only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so hard to gr@@ asp for a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all the victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; says Tig@@ ers manager Brad Wi@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two inside them , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed three R@@ uns for 6 time in the 1 / 3 .
it was not his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ do@@ zers each game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely .
the designed tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , its first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; he has carved the pl@@ ywood , &quot; said Aus@@ la@@ d .
he looked good at his ( kick training ) , looked at it better from the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three cents in mind at the end of the seventh inside , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .

with a pair of sc@@ ams and the final run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen came the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ches on a double Play .
it was the major league the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ches hit a Double Play .
after Detroit went to a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner , the wall made a R@@ B@@ I double to the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don , and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ h@@ ander t@@ oned S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his Fifth Sun .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hugh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inner ring against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the vulner@@ ability list , after he had been burnt more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished me , &quot; said Hugh@@ es , &quot; but I felt like I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the lead by the Vo@@ ad@@ off team , H@@ unters added a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought in the game by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z put his 0 @-@ 21 success @-@ series with the runners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game as he tried to get to the third to get the threat of the threat .
the ti@@ ers were seated in the second one , was achieved by one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ out single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he had not been well beaten , but he got the right spot .
Hugh@@ es was located in a pitch @-@ Count on a pitch for no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the re @-@ h@@ ander A.@@ J.@@ A@@ eder .
at Hugh@@ es , there were three hits for six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .

Isch@@ inger : Deutsche military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , keeps military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; I believe that thinking about military action options may not be held without Germany , &quot; he said .
he threw the European states &quot; collective space . &quot;
four years ago , it was very pleased that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also requested a massive increase in international assistance to refugees .

in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
your destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann ( German ) , with several other EU state and government officials requested a special summit for next week .

the EU states has not so far been to have joint action in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new call for the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee family in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries at the beginning and distribution of people .
this agreement will co @-@ operate in cooperation with the countries that the Merkel voted on late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the President of the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
Merkel stressed , those people who need to prevent dec@@ ays , wear this also .
but those who have no use of lead , also could not remain in Germany .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line is frequently advised of them .
because man@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ g@@ os contain high levels of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta car@@ ot@@ ine .
those who eat the fruit , thus supports ten@@ sion@@ ing , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ os , man@@ os should not be soft or to be firm and pleas@@ antly smell .
the form@@ work colour only says nothing , like the fruit is fruit - so also green man@@ g@@ os can taste delicious .
they should be kept at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course , pure or in sweet foods .

Rome has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square , almost 500 years after the Reformation .
in the presence of the town President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a date of nam@@ eless place in the park was bapt@@ ised in the park at the Opp@@ io hill on the name of the German reform .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is honoured again as &quot; German theore@@ ti@@ cian of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome , near the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the ep@@ onymous was applied by the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Protestant Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded the reason that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were able to live for centuries as a minority in secret their faith .
with the square in a symbolic manner , the tradition of Christian faith would be welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of 1510 / 11 .
he received the city back then as a promised fool .
upon the day of histori@@ ans , his negative impressions need to be encouraged in his later fight against Rome .
Luther continued to inter@@ c@@ ept the division of the western church with his theses against depos@@ itary .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that made Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated them .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who now appeared with splendid paintings .
at the beginning the picture was presented for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has set up his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and screen .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 year old - but what is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , it is quite adapted to the particular topics , which can quite seem quite dark .
around three years Ot@@ mar has worked at his bi@@ ble project for which he has taken a sub@@ jective , artistic choice from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles which dev@@ ote topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
as a result , he spont@@ aneously found several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment , just like the Kettler publishing house with its main focus on art books .
this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who argu@@ ed on the basis of painting using the bi@@ ble bi@@ ble .
he interpreted the Bible study from Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into today &apos;s inter@@ relations . &quot;
these lyrics are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
nestled between the text of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , it portra@@ ys his personal thoughts about the situation , between Martin Luther and Martin Luther &apos;s official text .
the je@@ wel has golden cou@@ sins .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into its soul , its emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions in fact been a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant rulers .
&quot; once the education continued with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt is thinking .
&quot; I tried to sign up that , in order to bear with the Lord my Father again . &quot;
his second concern is to help art in fast @-@ lasting time again : &quot; the perception of educational worlds is marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
the symbol@@ ism is being har@@ assed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have a mysterious and un@@ decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to see the viewer in the pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to discover , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands with his images . &quot;
I haven &apos;t accused the Bible completely to capture the Bible , but chosen for him most important , mysterious themes .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on the eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is the pictures , the text described merely . &quot; a images from the Bible emerged .
for Hans M@@ öhler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this facility is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öhler both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love as well as of the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn comm@@ ends
made up space , the company was t@@ asked to model ground level for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished .
over@@ sow@@ ing in politics and administration , especially among those who wanted to do the railway , did not toler@@ ate the railway .
well , hill deported , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the First Municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock could act now on board and youth affairs committee .
&quot; I hope this year &apos;s still visible , &quot; she said .
this should be started without a &quot; second commem@@ oration &quot; when working with the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the division played a significant mark on the weekend .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the up@@ swing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy his help in managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think it is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say on the principle , that doesn &apos;t go on me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; it must always be interested in the grip on the grip , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet there the Minister of State Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football field could help and wants to help .
the decisive change has to put politics .
for this reason , the German soccer federation has thus expanded its refugee policy &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues to continue until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA Convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
even some states support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ns place a clear sign if they will be tra@@ iled at the left tri@@ cot , otherwise custom@@ ary sponsor@@ ship &quot; We help the # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; back .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ y Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler to the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper &quot; ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; Self @-@ compreh@@ en@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on everybody , no one allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we have soccer rules , no , we have to utili@@ ze our jet force , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees that have been so incredibly diversi@@ fied , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ ders CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women will invite 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed companies had started their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we played , is living in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already declared the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .

&quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless . she was hau@@ gh@@ ty , hau@@ led himself up onto the street - so he told us &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; and &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could escape his work .

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) which he will return to Germany in October and will continue the software group .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I understood the whole time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and whose chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , says the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can pass that way . &quot;
&quot; important is to return again if you fell victim . &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ C without R@@ eus against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus would definitely be crushed in the first group game of the Europe League .
the national player is also missing the table leader of the football @-@ Bundesliga in du@@ el with the F@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot attack him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether R@@ eus goes back in the Bundesliga match in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in light of the high load of its professionals Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his trunk to the R@@ eus position .
so he quit the shift on the door@@ ke@@ over .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in the place of a b@@ art@@ ender Roman Br@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the World Champion the World Champion .
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is working in the future in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with a high probability , he will dispute the second game .
the for@@ mid@@ able statement of Mit@@ er R@@ eus said that the final campaign for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League has to be his goal , the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ er@@ f believes : &quot; that is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants a pioneer for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is to be a technological leader in the transformation of the vehicle .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the home of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which , among other things , fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Frankfurt Motor Show , &quot; a new mobile age . &quot;
automated , connected driving will increase road safety and take care of less st@@ ems , &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G7 countries , which will also come together with representatives of the industry .
the strategy of strategy of the Ministry of Transport , amongst others , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band extension and a generous donation to digital radio stations .
a test run is currently being developed on highway 9 in Bavaria .
with the driver &quot; to avoid additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check and check the legal framework conditions , where necessary , to adapt to new developments . &quot;
so , Germany would like to use around internationally that the permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
in addition , the Federal Government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees human beings as a driver .
when automated driving takes over the car &apos;s guide , the driver becomes more and more for passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Economic Affairs Ministry , high@@ ways driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible .
nevertheless , driving less vehicles on public roads are likely to be expected to move far as far as 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the study forecasts that value added value added in the area of driver assistance systems as well as the high @-@ automated driving features at its Reutlingen location . the authors of the study amounts to around 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD its transport t@@ iti@@ es@@ polit@@ ician S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
however , the recommendation of liability upon accidents and security of the personal data of the driver had to be clari@@ fied .
still the Germans are looking sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
one on Wednesday on the basis of the For@@ sa Institute , on behalf of the D@@ sa Institute , commissioned the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that self @-@ driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surveyed expect to 2025 by autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a digital composite project , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the journey across the roads .
on the fre@@ eway we could introduce no less than 15 percent in the flowing transport system , at a rise of 45 percent .
good every step would leave the car under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of quite large fashion @-@ looking and a wa@@ x@@ seed Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : window man@@ nequins , which have a human appearance thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who became the great star of the fashion scene among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits for the great star of the fashion scene - and with that he put men in pieces .
&quot; I can &apos;t say that I &apos;m interested in the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , but it &apos;s real , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk &apos; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from the 18th of September to the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is fortunate that fashion designers has changed his first post@@ ure attitude towards a show over his person .
it was actually he that he would have been &quot; for me sounded a sort of &quot; after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dress , &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give a gli@@ mp@@ se of the barely visible work of the man whose fashion history has been written to have completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed total art@@ works that was used for much effort : to work the d@@ olls , for example a styl@@ ist was engaged for example .

G@@ aul &apos;s old ted@@ dy is also available in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , par@@ atro@@ cious par@@ attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was no good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
having to play a d@@ olls , his parents would not have allowed him .
throwing fashion , he taught himself to itself later .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier was declared in Munich .
later I bought it then , of course .
for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models .
they were nothing , but they were allowed to keep the cl@@ am@@ ots .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ ush tip as fashion @-@ niche
it used to be in the long embroi@@ dery engines and to make pl@@ ough about meters .
the embroi@@ dered substances and sp@@ ik@@ es emerged in large quantities for customers , such as ceilings and curtains .
today , the E@@ quest@@ rian is no longer works today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the spre@@ ader Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important .
in the time of the pl@@ ush , fashion played a bigger role , then p@@ ushes through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is a few examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
the so @-@ called Vintage fashion , which leans on the past , is an increasing client .
those who do not use the textile branch in Germany is no longer available on the market .
they already make half of the orders .
spre@@ ader Pl@@ auen is a member of the association with nine other companies and st@@ eries along with nine other companies .
only them can carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years around 80 per cent of the turnover is broken away .
there are almost no personal business transactions and wholesale outlets .
our products are hardly able to achieve our products in this way .
the bulk goods are now much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region , and almost exclusively through chains .
it is also a weaker export , currently based on Russia and in the USA .
so enough reasons for new paths .
as a result of environmental awareness , the industry association tries to score as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year , we have a seal of quality that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also rel@@ ates to the materials used . &quot;
graduate in Ute Schmidt , member of the Berlin @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au , Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and tips .
to achieve the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a range of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories which have to think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , existing design is often only slightly varies to keep a client base .
some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter form the historic snow @-@ pointed tip .

the pl@@ ush Gold@@ schmi@@ ed master@@ at Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ß allowed himself to be inspired : &quot; I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ grain tip for their jewelry .

EU wants to double its mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and helps to achieve a significantly higher dose of nervous equipment .
consumer rights F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate employee in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for the approval of &quot; risks and side effects of industrial and environmental policy , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt of F@@ ood@@ watch announced .
according to Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt , the limits of the nerve gas for large fish at the end of the food chain , like shar@@ ks or wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
large dat@@ ory fishes are having a mercury limit so strongly that , on the basis of the current limit values , about 50 per cent of the ranks cannot be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be withdrawn .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limits to F@@ ood@@ watch with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch noted this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually are too low so that they already comply with the highest possible values already today .
therefore , the ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is thus &quot; an exercise man@@ oeu@@ vre , which alone helps the economy , &quot; says Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt .
mercury is a high @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which strongly suggests itself above the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; small quantities have already been causing severe damage to the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of the Federal Ministry explains its homepage with respect to the common limits , however , that a &quot; health threat of general public &quot; is not expected .
mercury is mainly represented by coal fat burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Education , German coal @-@ fired power drew more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount produced in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as river El@@ be , Rhine and Danube were &quot; permanent and surface covering , &quot; had been quoted in March from the paper .
last year , mercury @-@ wide war@@ nings had already been reported in the European haz@@ ard warning system R@@ AS@@ FF @-@ wide in European war@@ nings .
