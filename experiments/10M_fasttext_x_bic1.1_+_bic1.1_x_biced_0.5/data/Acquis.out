the aim of the procedures specified in this agreement is the tim@@ ely discovery of a significant quantity of nuclear forces for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bombs for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ r@@ ence of such a breakdown by the risk of early discovery .
for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the target set in Article 28 , the material preser@@ vation is used as the backup measure of fundamental importance , maintaining and the observation as important supplem@@ entary measures , used .
the implementation of the evaluation by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for any material storage zone , which is not given for a specific period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
when performing their re@@ tests , the organization makes 3 full use of ensuring the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear @-@ materials according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the use of your safety measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make the following type of use and , as far as necessary , to see how it is intended for supplem@@ entary changes and purpose , are :
a ) a measuring system for determin@@ ing the quantities of drow@@ ning , produced , lost , lost @-@ length , or any other way from the continu@@ ance of the core and the stock market ;
B ) evalu@@ ating the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement data ;
C ) Proc@@ edure , assessment and assessment of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
e ) methods to evaluate tests as measured and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which encomp@@ asses the core material zone and the changes of this inventory , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) Pre@@ ferences , which will ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements will be implemented correctly ;
h ) In accordance with reports of reports to the organization , in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures in accordance with this Convention does not extend to material in mining or in the ore @-@ processing .
B ) defines urine or th@@ ory material which has not yet been achieved under the ( c ) phase of the core com@@ bu@@ stible cycle which is introduced in the States , thus divi@@ des the community of the organization the amount and composition of the material with , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nu@@ kle@@ ar purposes ;
C ) the core material , which is suitable for composition and pur@@ ification for fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ en@@ rich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase , which is manufactured , or will be introduced into the states in later phase of the nuclear carrier cycle , so it is subject to the others in this agreement .
a ) The application planned in this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with Article 11 . however , the community is the opinion that the withdrawal of nuclear materials , the securing effect is subject to the agreement if the withdrawal is provision@@ ally not possible or desired , so please consult the organization and community on the application of appropriate safety measures .
B ) In this agreement , the safety measures imposed under the following conditions are terminated in accordance with Article 13 , as long as the organization and community will determine that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ recur@@ r@@ able .
upon request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the safety measures to this Convention :
a ) special bra@@ i@@ fiable material if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
B ) Core materials , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear operations in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is rec@@ al@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ mal concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium 210 that is over 80 % .
upon request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to safety measures in accordance with this agreement , as far as the total due to this article in the States freed nuclear material quantity to no date more than
a ) a total of kilograms special p@@ iss@@ ile material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with a en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a en@@ rich@@ ment that is located under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the Natur@@ uran , is calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ time square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;

the B@@ IS could close stand @-@ by @-@ loan agreements with central banks of the credit@@ or countries , when banks issue a proper application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount paid by the credit@@ or country to the mechanism paid fee , and within a total speed of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounts ; this equ@@ ates to 50 % of all future operators in the member countries .
but already mentioned below some terms , as their application the B@@ IS would be ready .
at each Stand@@ by credit the B@@ IS would first take over a commitment to two years , with the possibility of extensions , without that however , a total of five years will be exceeded .
during the opening of loans , as well as any other extension , the B@@ IS would charge a creative opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw is not made before the end of the month after the closing of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so the Bank may make the required adjustments of their own liquidity .
the draw would be made available in the local currencies of the agreement at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would be extended to periods taking into account the bank &apos;s means , expected to be three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who comply with the B@@ IS at the time of similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market places .
however , if the B@@ IS must proc@@ ure the required funds even on the market , the next interest rate will be a maximum of achieving an increase in the Libor rate .
I would be thank@@ ful if you would tell me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .

a reag@@ ent to blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples , which contain the an@@ tigen that is homogen@@ eous , the antibodies or another on the label specified .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manufacturer recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not appear : a ) H@@ äm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the tit@@ re is measured twice in a suitable medium by the re@@ lu@@ te of the re@@ examined reag@@ ents .
according to Tit@@ er , tit@@ re is the number of strongest serum concentration , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated only by the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents , which are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed by time , which is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on a object @-@ carrier .
the World Health Organisation has defined for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are processed for the time standards .
according to the definition , a international standard prepar@@ ate contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of titles that are observed in particular preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational gran@@ ting , which is observed in a series of th@@ inners in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te installation .
the title indicates the th@@ inner of the reag@@ ents in the last mix within a series , in which a micro@@ scop@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination appears .
the efficacy of reag@@ ents for blood group determination are present for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as indirect anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in the basis of the title of unknown reag@@ ents in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you put it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ing according to the definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are free of charge of the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards in the World Health Organization , Stat@@ utes Serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative title of the International standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A @-@ Re@@ ag@@ enz@@ es ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC F@@ IL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored among the manufacturers recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties will remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent form , according to label , is not a year after the last satisfactory activity test .
it is based on the label exp@@ iry date of dry re@@ acts , according to the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation test ; it is appro@@ ving by government regulatory authorities .
dry re@@ acts are kept in an atmosphere of iner@@ ary gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container , in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can enter .
a dry stran@@ t may not lose a maximum of 0,5 BC of his weight when it is driven by more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg for a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the chemical reactions delivered ) is added to an ant@@ is@@ ep@@ tic and / or antibiot@@ ic as long as the reag@@ ent with the added substance continues to stim@@ ulate the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must be at least 2.5 mg protein powder per ml liquid or re @-@ dissolved service .
the reag@@ ents , whether in liquid form or after the re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may neither contain se@@ di@@ ments or any visible particles .
the implementation of the international exchange for the blood group determination should not be arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally colored , at least as long as did not until a international agreement has come about a uniform system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are present in such a way and in such volumes that the reag@@ ent reag@@ ent is not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount of being in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer @-@ Lab has all production levels and checks of reag@@ ents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all given reag@@ ents are to be kept for so long from the laboratory atory , except with some probability that the batch can no longer be used .
the reag@@ ents of substances used for blood vessels can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary tools for rein@@ forcement the effectiveness and conservation of the stability of the reag@@ ents .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their actual share in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
each individual container is a black printed on white printed label in English and French , containing the following details : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity , or , for dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the necessary liquid necessary ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual container holds , or the instructions provided by the container are included : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount , or , for dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the necessary liquid necessary ,
every program is assigned a certificate according to Article 4 of the agreement according to the system , adding to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons of group B , which can be characterized by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , which contain A @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of the group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . there are no human red blood cells that do not contain any A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood @-@ groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum can be dissolved in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for anti @-@ A blood group meetings or a corresponding compar@@ ative balance of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells .
in no case , the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A serum is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent reduction from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt will occur with the same time dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ A blood group race or a standard equal to equal lines .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons of the group A , which can be characterized by red blood cells or by specific substances of the B group .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , which contain B @-@ An@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood @-@ groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood cells that do not contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood @-@ groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum can be dissolved in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ B blood group experience or a corresponding compar@@ ative balance of B @-@ blood cells .
anti @-@ B serum is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent reduction of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempt must be dissolved with the same standard , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ B blood group experience or with a standard equal to equal lines .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is extracted from the blood of selected persons of the group 0 , which can be characterized by red blood cells or specific substances of the A and B group B immune cells .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , which contain Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gene A and / or B , i.e. those of the group A including the sub@@ groups of A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; it is gluten @-@ free no human red blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ genic A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
it is passionate about human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ glut@@ inated in the common anti @-@ A serum of group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ A blood group experience or a corresponding compar@@ ative balance , separate against swelling of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is dissolved in parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ B blood group experience or a corresponding comparison of blood @-@ blood cells .
in no case , the effectiveness of the server must not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause easily recognis@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 percent swelling of A1 and A2 , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempts with the same must be dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ A blood group experience , or with a standard preparations for the same activity .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent reduction in the double time , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same attempt must be dissolved with the same standard of anti @-@ B blood groups or standard prepar@@ ative equal lines .
if an anti @-@ B + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed with the same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 percent reduction in blood cells , thus the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each specific@@ ity can be one of two types that distinguish themselves through the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , which is achieved by ag@@ glut@@ ination hom@@ olog@@ ated blood cells .
with others , which are called &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be reached in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cattle alb@@ um@@ in or with the help of other special methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Sera lam@@ inated on object carriers even hom@@ olog@@ ated red blood cells that are absorbed in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements relating to the effectiveness of the R@@ h Group may possibly change if international standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ serum serum is extracted from the blood of one or more of several people , which are immune to the An@@ tigen D of the R@@ h @-@ Systems .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , which include an@@ tigen D , but not contain human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Sera must have a tit@@ re of at least 1 : 32 versus c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 95 % cooking solution .
an &quot; in@@ fusion &quot; Anti @-@ D serum is simultaneously dissolved in parallel with the un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ ative anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison of c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , which include an@@ tigen D , the serum is intended to react with blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , who are destined for the use of object carriers by the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50 percent up@@ swing of c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells at about 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 30 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more of several people , which are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous C of the R@@ h @-@ Systems .
it re@@ acts with swelling of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not contain human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Sera ob@@ servers are therefore specifically designed for the C @-@ an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are absorbed in a 0.@@ 9@@ % cooking solution .
the title of the Anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ cd@@ dee blood cells .
anti @-@ C Sera , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not a form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50 percent up@@ swing of C@@ cd@@ dee blood cells at about 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more of several people , which are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h @-@ Systems .
anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) the tit@@ re of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Sera , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in any form Anti @-@ D ) must be mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50 % blood cells at about 40 ° C , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be extracted directly from the blood immune system or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a joint serum both antibodies must be effective simultaneously by the manufacturer specified responsi@@ veness .
if a serum is intended to be used on object carriers by the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ability of all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , will not be inferior to the anti @-@ day antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from blood of animals , which can be syn@@ thes@@ ized by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ An@@ tigen that is called to those of blood @-@ groups A and AB including sub@@ assemblies A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; there are no human red blood cells that do not contain any A @-@ an@@ tigen that means those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ A blood group experience or a corresponding compar@@ ative balance , separately with swelling of A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ A serum is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent reduction from A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B @-@ blood cells , which is required if the same attempt must occur with the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ A blood group race or a standard equal to equal lines .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals , which can be syn@@ thes@@ ized by red blood cells or specific substances of blood group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the B @-@ An@@ tigen that is called B @-@ An@@ tigen that means those of blood @-@ groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood cells that do not contain B @-@ an@@ tigen that means those of blood @-@ groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations of the anti @-@ B blood group experience or a corresponding compar@@ ative balance , with a s@@ uns@@ ure of blood cells of group B group B ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ B serum is mixed with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent reduction of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time , which is required if the same try is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but in@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations for the anti @-@ B blood group experience or with a standard equal to equal lines .
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood group patients must include ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Compl@@ ements .
it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are syn@@ thes@@ ized by injection of human serum proteins .
