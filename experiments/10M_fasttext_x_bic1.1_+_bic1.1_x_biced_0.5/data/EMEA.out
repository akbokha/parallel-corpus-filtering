the present document is a summary of the European opening report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ed@@ ress@@ ors ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated as the committee described in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
if you need more information on your condition or treatment , please read the Pack@@ ages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in mouth ) as a solution for inclusion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Cast thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mist@@ rust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psych@@ ic condition involving patients with man@@ ic episodes ( Peri@@ od abnormal atmosphere ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe Man@@ atic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for fast control of increased ag@@ itation or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the medicine is not possible .
in both cases , the solution may take the solution or melt tablets in patients with the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy is needed , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of neur@@ ons to another .
Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ ro &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine plays a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ov@@ ol helps to norm@@ alize the activity of brain activity , which will be reduced psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will be prevented .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the recovery of symptoms , was investigated in three studies by up to one year .
the efficacy of injection solution was compared with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases in two studies , compared with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared with a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared with twelve weeks of 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which had been res@@ orted to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was found in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which compared to t@@ amp@@ ly ag@@ itation , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to take @-@ up ( up ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , Abi@@ li@@ fy received doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms based ag@@ itation than patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented placebo for up to 74 weeks compared to placebo @-@ recur@@ r@@ ational episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses , Abi@@ li@@ fy @-@ injec@@ tions were even more effective than placebo which increased symptoms and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ble ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , ob@@ struction and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased storage production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , and with the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , mainly man@@ ic episodes , and with whom the man@@ ic episodes had responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an ol , against the risks .
in addition , the Committee passed on the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder suffer@@ ers , if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients that were mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a daily dose of 15 mg / day , daily regardless of meals .
a increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although single patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , ir@@ respective of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder treatment in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
having regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ation dose should be considered if clinical factors are just@@ ify themselves ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the arith@@ me@@ tical dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases according to the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with treating Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ ol existed in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction or isch@@ emia , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with hem@@ at@@ ric medicines ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which one year or less continued , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol advoc@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if in case of an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be drawn up , reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if one patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever , without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , have to be removed .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ u@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of history or conditions , which are used with sei@@ zu@@ res , with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol , an elevated death of death in comparison to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dose and the response of un@@ wanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
Hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ an or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients that were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients receiving direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ they , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally known in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution occurs when Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ñ@@ ol in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines referred to as Se@@ as ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant to clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers an extremely effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dose @-@ reductions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism may result the common application of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism .
if you consider the common use of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should ex@@ pose the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dose @-@ reductions .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the dose height prior to the starting therapy .
di@@ lat@@ az@@ em or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be calculated with a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ tical concentration .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ or ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should come to notify her doctor if she will be pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ole .
due to in@@ adequate data security for the human being and due to the concerns affected by the animal rights in pregnancy , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit just@@ ifies the potential risk of the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against , hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol has no influence on it .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequencies of the below side effects are defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ir@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was performed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another controlled long @-@ term study more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was diagnosed in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ emia treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients with Lyme disease treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was found in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients with placebo @-@ treated treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , found no medic@@ ally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ric syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ eness and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute claims with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ov@@ ol alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment in treating a transition with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is unlikely that Hem@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol has a high pl@@ as@@ map@@ le binding .
it assumes that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ practice in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - receptor and ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors are communic@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity for d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as an effective aff@@ inity for the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ DC , for alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ r@@ users and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day over 2 weeks , the Pos@@ it@@ ons Emis@@ sions Emission @-@ Tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ depend@@ ant reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands and nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and by the tur@@ key .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a week 52 the proportion of patients enrolled in a half @-@ day trial which included a response to study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured values defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than on hal@@ op@@ eri@@ ac .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in decl@@ ining rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind trial involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia of 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients enrolled in significantly fewer patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ i@@ ber@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over three weeks of placebo over three weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ists over 3 weeks with fixed dose for patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ i@@ ber@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy .
in two cases of placebo and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ists for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ i@@ ber@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to placebo in week 3 and an assessment effect compared to lithium or semi @-@ visual i@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ i@@ ber@@ z@@ ole also showed a similar proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania to like lithium or semi @-@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder with a mixed or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ en@@ ol y@@ ielded an superior efficacy in reducing economic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ ov@@ ol , compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , predominantly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline .
based on in vitro studies the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ cycline used by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is cataly@@ sed through CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation life is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol for an extensive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours with &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and similarly , in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , patients showed no gender @-@ related effects .
a pop @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of space on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ u@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with differences of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw shots on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repet@@ itive gift , reproductive st@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ ogenic potential , there are no specific dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or exposure that exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated a dos@@ ing method of tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people ) .

in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind trial involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia of 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients enrolled in significantly fewer patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ists over 3 weeks with fixed dose for patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ i@@ ber@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol was compared to pre @-@ taking with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol in tablet form at healthy volunteers , the ratio was between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Out@@ standing , a chol@@ eli@@ ps@@ ori@@ asis as a result of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ jug@@ ites of hydro@@ xy@@ lic Met@@ abol@@ ites of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3@@ times the medium Ste@@ ady @-@ State Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ s of the recommended maximum dose when people are based on mg / m2 ) .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for the rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ol injection solution should be terminated and the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol are begun .
to minim@@ ize the absorption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , a injection was recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle of revers@@ ing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into consideration the drugs that are already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug on AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y melting , or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution for inclusion .
there is no research on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in addition , if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ e@@ ae additionally considered to be considered necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme reduction or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations into the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction or isch@@ emia , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with hem@@ at@@ ric medicines ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which one year or less continued , there were occasional reports about the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol advoc@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and an autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ they , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally known for schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications .

105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant to clin@@ ically .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism of metabolism can result in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 from Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dose @-@ reductions .
after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the dose height prior to the starting therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was larger compared to the sole offering of Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ ñ@@ ol .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral disorders , was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding aggression and behavi@@ oral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean follow @-@ up of the initial improvement in the initial 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ a@@ oh@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy in relation to the total population was observed , but statistical significance was determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a week 52 the proportion of patients enrolled in a half @-@ day patient who held a response to study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ al pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured values defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than on hal@@ op@@ eri@@ ac .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in decl@@ ining rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ al pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind trial involved in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia of more than 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients enrolled more patients with a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially performed over 2 weeks in lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy , y@@ ielded an superior efficacy in reducing economic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a study study which took part in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which roughly three quarters had obtained a anth@@ ra@@ cycline .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as Mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 of Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 female patients , the conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
consider only the patients who were treated for the first time to metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the disease and survival in terms of illness and survival .
by contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it may also not be used in patients , breast@@ feeding or before the beginning of the treatment for low neutr@@ ality numbers in the blood .
the Committee for human@@ ist ten@@ ant ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients , where the first treatment did not strike any more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines was that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines does not have to be given to other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Company Abra@@ ile Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited a approval for the rush of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xes for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown and for which an standard anth@@ ra@@ cycline @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( Neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ic number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy for the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
for sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 treatment is reduced until a improvement is achieved in degrees 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patient suffering from adverse kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended to use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ convenience and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulate , which could be considerably more pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and had a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neutral number of number increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ cy@@ tic number increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a unique with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven in the case of cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiovascular diseases are not unusual , especially in patients suffering from previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these patients can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ eti@@ ka and con@@ sti@@ y means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not practic@@ ed , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane apply a reliable prevention method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be recommended , during and up to six months after treatment no child may be witnesses .
male patients should be advised before treatment of a sperm counter , because the treatment with myst@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequently ) and dizziness ( often ) that can counter@@ act on the per@@ sever@@ ity and the ability to serve machines .
these are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III trial every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 bab@@ y@@ ane .
Neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most remarkable important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ing ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 there are side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication of studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The frequency of the trans@@ iti@@ vity reaction is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients .
since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no col@@ aus@@ al connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli ingredient , which promotes the co@@ ag@@ ulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from tubes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli .
this stabi@@ lization leads to a in@@ hibition of normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is vital for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in cells were medi@@ ated in the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in @-@ vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the presence of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ si@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ ale transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ re@@ viewer is convey@@ ed and caused by the alb@@ umin@@ ant protein SP@@ ARC ( ref@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for m@@ eric m@@ am@@ carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two @-@ tone unver@@ sion@@ ed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy of 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 229 ) .
when recording in the study 64 % of patients had an affected general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy alone , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity over pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who lived in a periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for sound insulation on Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the tot@@ t @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the response exposure ( AU@@ C ) rose early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane an patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took effect on multi @-@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume distribution volume has a wide range of ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or line @-@ up of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study conducted with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 non @-@ oxide with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ gift higher ( 43 % ) as after a sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in published literature over in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue paper it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily associated with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average total dose is 4 % of the given total dose of less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance .

this means that se@@ ams are similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference sel@@ ective ) . &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood flow values , in which , in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur , if a blood @-@ blood flow is not possible and in which a loss of blood of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ ams must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is shown .
in patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ ha@@ ke , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected in a v@@ ein .
injection can also be done by the patient or the support staff , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ iles per adult or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl on children ) .
the iron levels of all patients are to control , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron ore drugs should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients suffering from kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may cause an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby that the body is not sufficient on the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ ine .
ery@@ th@@ rop@@ oi@@ et@@ in is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) which enabled them to the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients receiving an@@ a@@ emia problems caused by kidney problems .
all of the participating patients were inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene was inj@@ ected before they were either placed on par@@ se@@ amed or continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indication for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled se@@ ams with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o studied at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ itation values of patients that were submitted to Ab@@ se@@ amed as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in contrast , the patients who continue to get E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise of blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , st@@ ress@@ ful mig@@ raine heada@@ ches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as additional studies are necessary to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations adopted by the European Union of evidence , the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed company , will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg permit approval from Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , if ha@@ em@@ ulator @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ adequate , in case of planned larger operating instructions , which demand a large blood volume ( 4 or more units blood in men ) .
as a result of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion compensation has been expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood @-@ loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml must be applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ con@@ formity should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,8 m@@ mol / l ) .
an@@ ew symptoms and symptoms may be different depending on age , gender , and total disease of disease ; hence the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease insur@@ rection is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient with individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values or under the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target con@@ cent@@ ation .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ glo@@ omy vari@@ ability , more than a dose of dose is attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be monitored continuously to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa should be used in the lowest authorised dose which is needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need more power outlets as patients in which the initial an@@ emia should be less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may need more power outlets as patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia should be less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 kg / kg three times per week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose of 25 kg / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ ew symptoms and - follow @-@ up effects may be different depending on age , gender , and total disease of disease ; hence the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease insur@@ rection is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ glo@@ omy vari@@ ability , more than a dose of dose is attempted to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be monitored continuously to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa should be used in the lowest authorised dose which is needed for control of an@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ te increase by more than 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , should maintain the dose of 150 kg / kg three times per week or 450 kg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the reproduction of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 kg / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 kg / kg three times per week the hem@@ og@@ bell value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tic number increased to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , should maintain the dose of 300 kg / kg three times a week .
however , the hem@@ og@@ bell value is &lt; 1 g / l ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , with which the pre@@ p@@ ent in@@ lay of ≥ 4 blood @-@ conservative should be required , ab@@ se@@ amed at a dose of 600 kg / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operating procedure .
the Iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program - they will be made available to large iron reserves before the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ eded therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 kg / kg of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given a weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
in this case , Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa was pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively for 300 kg / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , injection is given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis over the hose of a F@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensuring a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from treatment with some ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine at a ery@@ thro@@ blast block@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should get ill or any other ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast block@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stro@@ kes within one month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep Ven@@ en@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis ( e.g. , ne@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known ven@@ ous Th@@ ro@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lien ) .
in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c operation , the application of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa occurs during the following pre@@ - , supp@@ or@@ tive arter@@ ial hypertension , v@@ ascular disease of the body or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently beaten heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
Ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sti@@ p@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported via the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in .
in patients with sudden retirement , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) , with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value and the usual causes for a failure ( iron , fol@@ ates or vitamin B12 deficiency , infections or infections , loss of blood , and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ te is normal , taking into consideration the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index ) , which is detected ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liters , or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ th@@ rop@@ ho@@ bic antibodies were determined and an investigation from the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ ams in patients with risk @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 Pati@@ ents with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target con@@ cent@@ ation under Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for severe cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ature events were observed if ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stim@@ ulating active ingredients ( ESA ) were given to a hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine if the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ omy concentration is increased over the concentration of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase of hypertension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure or con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , the recommended limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 .
following the present findings by the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al failure is not accelerated .
in case of tumour patient suffering from ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in response should be taken into account ( patients that possibly must be trans@@ fixed ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk for possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 of the patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ er@@ emia - Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization with the aim to keep the hem@@ og@@ bell value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in relation to the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients receiving an ar@@ de@@ an orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure , if possible , before the onset of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa medication , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and accordingly treated .
patients who under@@ go a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c procedure should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ ous diseases , especially in the under@@ lying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded , that in treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a preparation value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk for postoperative ast@@ igmat@@ ism / vas@@ cul@@ ous events can be found .
in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ine was not detected for ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine that they can survive the overall survival or reduce the risk of tumor cancer in cancer patients .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer that received chemotherapy , if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target con@@ cent@@ ages of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted
ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa should be used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ is should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ se dose would be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .

the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is a dos@@ ing rise in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ inen treatment .
regardless of the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ et@@ in treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease may occur after repeated blood don@@ ate to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cul@@ ous complications .

survival and tum@@ ors were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in total survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and the controls .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients with an an@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ ome consistency , statistically significantly higher mortality as in controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and insp@@ ections .
there is an increased risk for thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ian events in tumor patient treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are treated on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine in tumor patient treated with the aim to transfer a hem@@ og@@ bell value below 13 g / dl , because a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life time of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are reached after the intraven@@ ous injection .
there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they are destined for 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

acet@@ sta is prescribed for treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
it is used in patients with a high fre@@ ading risk ( broken break@@ through@@ s ) , including in patients who had suffered a minor prot@@ ector as they suffered . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus passport should be taken at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection in a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta , the symptoms can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for z@@ om@@ eta was attracted by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was investigated the number of vert@@ eb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second trial included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get was tested in two studies in two studies , compared to 3@@ 57 patients and compared to the risk of mac@@ phosph@@ ate for six months .
the main indication for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme which builds broken bones ) in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of flu@@ ent frac@@ tures were reduced in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) over a period of three years compared to placebo for 70 % .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis e@@ dical ) the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients were treated under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients in placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur in the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may possibly be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ orus , or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ate data on Ac@@ la@@ sta the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion or oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ros@@ is ( extin@@ ction of bone mass ) in the j@@ aw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provide clari@@ fying materials for doctors who prescri@@ bes the Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the similar material for patients in which the medicine is explained and shown on it when they turn to the doctor .

the patient inform@@ al package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Conc@@ ern@@ ation of contradiction in pregnancy and feeding women • Re@@ quired physical activity , non @-@ smokers and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious adverse events • When to seek medical or nursing help
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients suffering from low @-@ trau@@ matic stro@@ kes .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of acet@@ one is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic position , the administration is recommended by Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operational supply of hip frac@@ tion@@ ing ( see section 5.1 ) .
for treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus passport .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get started with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long trial period in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus passport , an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic position , an initi@@ ation dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the use of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 as data are missing for in@@ convenience and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient &apos;s population only limited clinical experiences .
an earlier hypo@@ kal@@ emia is pre @-@ treated prior to the beginning of therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in bone structure , a temporary , mit@@ able hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus passport , an adequate supply of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be weighed in prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ate , a dental inspection with appropriate pre @-@ treatment dental treatment .
for patients who require dental treatment , there are no data available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduced the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the pine area .
the clinical assessment of the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days of administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by the use of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of as serious cases reported cases of hop@@ ef@@ ulness was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 out of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - recur@@ rent freight ) trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total incidence of hop@@ ef@@ ulness is comparable between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) of un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al impair@@ ment Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in the kidney function ) and in rare cases as an acute kidney failure .
changes of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( annually measured before the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a partial kidney function in a clinical trial of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compar@@ ably between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory analysis , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ atic calcium values measured below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus passport studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures according to a hip frac@@ tion@@ ing and in the morph@@ ing Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures according to a recent circum@@ vent , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical study has been reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion interface , such as redness , swelling , swelling , or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ ate area were especially reported for cancer patients , via oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the head range ) , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental handles .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ros@@ is in the hospital with an Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of an overdose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be obtained through the gift of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) the efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density or a BM@@ D score for the Sh@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ agen ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing vert@@ eb@@ rates .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine Ac@@ tions Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly increased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new flu@@ ential frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older were compared to 60 % reduced risk for vert@@ eb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta demonstrated a consistent effect over three years that resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density of the lum@@ bar acid , hips , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly to all points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total hat@@ s by 6.0 % , the incl@@ ination by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ enk@@ amm .
a micro@@ computer comp@@ uted ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with Ac@@ la@@ sta patients compared to placebo an increase of intra@@ ocular bone volume and ob@@ taining the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ sh mark@@ er The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced the B@@ SAP to 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ als was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D on total weight and sl@@ abs as at all points of time .
in contrast to placebo @-@ treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to placebo @-@ treatment and 4,3 % at the base plate .
clinical efficacy in male in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized in 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical efficacy in men ; the incidence of clinical contrac@@ tures were 7.5 % in cases of Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the ever annual administration of Ac@@ ad@@ dr@@ on@@ at was included in comparison to the weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at in relation to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone of the bone of the bone was examined in patients and patients with radi@@ ally severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( average serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid , in comparison with intake of 30 mg ri@@ p@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months , was detected in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
the combined results was observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who have been classified as Respon@@ sibility during the end of the six @-@ month study ( on therapy ) could be admitted into a follow up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ass@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic an@@ ions of 141 of the patients treated with the risk of ris@@ k@@ ron@@ at treated with a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multi@@ ples of 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that seem to be dos@@ ing .
after that , the plasma seal increased rapidly from &lt; 10 % to the maximum value to 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ phase van@@ ishes from the large circulation of half times t ½ -@@ 0,@@ 24 and t ½ h 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ levels ) are probably representing the quick absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tions over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the valid dose is found in the urine , while the remainder is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body@@ weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid concentration , by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration on time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance by using cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme metabolic syndrome is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not metabolic in humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and at the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in fact that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dis@@ ruption to up to 35 ml / min do not require dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
because there are no problem for heavy ren@@ al problems ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ational Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , this population is not possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies on dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , administered over a 15 @-@ minute period , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
Sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intraven@@ ous application has been determined by dos@@ ages of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in rats , equivalent to a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose representing the 7@@ fold of the humane therapeutic exposure that corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application with accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the inten@@ tional human exposure , the tox@@ ic@@ ological effects were caused by other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common method in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ vity of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as an outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such skel@@ eton .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is a representative of a sub@@ class , called the bis@@ phosph@@ orus , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and murder of the bone of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ rogen , which are formed from Andro@@ s , play a role in the more gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone structure is made too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone structure , thereby creating a normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or under@@ take a dental operation , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in use of Ac@@ la@@ sta using other drugs . please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nur@@ ses , if you have taken other medicines and have been applied and applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines , of which it is known to damage the kidneys .
with food and beverages , you are worried that you should take enough liquid according to the doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you by your doctor or nur@@ ses in a v@@ ein .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients with a body massage index ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
in addition , four trials performed on more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to placebo as the support of the smoking .
however , the studies on setting of space showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to estimate this application area .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? he found the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper breath . ng The complete listing of the associated side effects associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects is to take away .
it must also be used in patients who suffer from an existing depression or treat anti@@ depress@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and among others in a small minority of patients Su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .

the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight .
medicine used in patients who need health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( provision of re@@ conn@@ aissance acts for patients and doctors ) , and in order to support the Ar@@ z
in addition to diet and movement for the treatment of obesity ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which are beyond one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 on the basis of absence of data on effectiveness and in@@ convenience .
La Depres@@ sive diseases or voting changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported for up to 10 % of the patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant for up to 1 % of the patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) .
GE and for depres@@ sive disorders may not be applied to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case outw@@ eigh@@ s the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
also in patients who are - beside the obesity - no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions may occur .
relatives or other nearby persons ) are noted that it is necessary to monitor the new symptoms of such symptoms and get medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and in@@ convenience of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , or stroke , etc . ) before less than 6 months were completed by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort is believed to be the simultaneous gift of pot@@ ent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors , and the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
in addition , SS@@ E examined important patients and patients with an O@@ bes@@ ity in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the un@@ wanted effects of un@@ wanted effects in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients that were treated for weight reduction and for accompanying metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statistically significantly higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ rates ( for un@@ wanted effects could be more than 1 % ) or when they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng In the evaluation of side effects , the following numbers are laid down :
very frequent ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0,1 % , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t@@ aller
in a toler@@ ant study , in which a limited number of persons , up to 300 mg were administered , only slight symptoms were observed .
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ de@@ mia .
n weight reduction after a year stood for A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA 20 mg of 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.9 kg C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
patients who were treated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA 20 mg , and 1,2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years the difference in the overall weight reduction was between A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA and placebo @-@ 4.2 kg ( C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
9 weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with
under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average decrease of tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des was seen by 6.9 % ( initial tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des 1,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 %
in a second study in patients with a obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with a bas@@ eline value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0,8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo .
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the group of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference between the middle weight of the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ value in patients who had taken the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg had approximately 50 % due to the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim of Ar@@ z

the influence of food : it subjects who received the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the age of life or after a fat meal , in the case of food intake increased by 67 % increased C@@ max and increased ng up by 48 % .
patients with black skin color cannot contain up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other eth@@ n@@ ically populations .
n most popul@@ ati@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient is a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C as a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of any undes@@ irable un@@ wanted effects that were not observed in clinical trials , but were evaluated as relevant for clinical use as potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with process @-@ related stress seems to be connected to the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the m@@ ating ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery of the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no undes@@ ired effects on ferti@@ lization or cycle disorders were observed .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development has been studied at the rat no . 10 mg / kg / day .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European public consultation report ( EP@@ AR ) , explained in which the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ ed@@ ress@@ ors ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated as the committee described in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy medicine ) in patients ( particularly important patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( diabe@@ tic medicine ) is not used .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( particularly important patients ) , it can not be taken satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl alcohol or insulin , the previous dose of the sulph@@ ide @-@ substance or insulin can be preserved , except for patients with hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ics should be reduced or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be processed better and decreases blood sugar levels , so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ one was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ ness , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered with the use of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of acet@@ ylene in the treatment of metast@@ asis and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ist in a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increase by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ one and insulin had been studied in 289 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , compared with 0.@@ 14 % compared to 6 months , compared with 0,@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ r ( high kidney levels - ac@@ id@@ yl@@ ation level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ counting is to serve as an alternative to the patient &apos;s standard treatment as an alternative to the patient &apos;s standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ e@@ Europe R &amp; D Centre as a approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and wear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate in those due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are threatened by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. past , heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increases the dose continuously .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin .
an cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ature outlet study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients aged 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , and existing pharmac@@ as@@ cul@@ ous disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver frequency values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on cannot be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors can be increased to 3 times the maximum limit of the standard , the liver frequency values are as soon as possible to control .
in case a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , wa@@ iter problems , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark resin , are to check the liver values .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be conducted until the presence of the laboratory parameters in the clinical assessment should be conducted .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be ign@@ ant and attached in some cases linked to fluid operation .
as a result of a hem@@ og@@ el@@ ution in combination with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a slight decrease in the middle hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , in patients that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on exists as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sulph@@ ate har@@ ness or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
after the market launch it was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ o@@ din@@ itis , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a occurr@@ ence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , however , the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma should be aware of the possibility of distur@@ ban@@ ces ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological assignment should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages that were randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated error response was 1,9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drug .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants to pursue a pregnancy or a patient , the treatment is to im@@ pose ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for investigations of inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines prescribed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er are not expected .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with a fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , in pregnancy , hypertension and increased insulin resistance to the parent is reduced and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the dry growth .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and refra@@ c@@ tory tracking of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents occurred over the three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under Placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups using met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ u@@ ene har@@ ness .
in an out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced mac@@ ular condition , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than in placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on respectively .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported via heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , more frequently if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ nese .
a summar@@ izing analysis of messages were randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative drugs .
in the scope of the ongoing trial period of 3.5 years , questionn@@ aires at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occur .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to effect on a activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to the animal model to an increased ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral glu@@ cos@@ t in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ en@@ zi@@ d as Mon@@ otherapy has been conducted over two years to assess time to subsequent therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of treated patients ( over 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ en@@ ci@@ dal ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was assigned to in@@ sufficient optim@@ isation with insulin delivery , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients that continue to be insulin ; a reduced insulin delivery in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , below Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statistically significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ator showed a statistically significant decrease in the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo one reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel and lower level , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol cholesterol .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eride in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
compared to placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel , whereas under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d decreased values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , which is also increased by a effect on the tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption , as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ active study , a cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ature outlet study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing , advanced pharmac@@ ological disease were random@@ ly allocated to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy to either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
after an oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the top concentration of the variable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma was usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

according to oral usage of radioactive mark@@ er Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the fur ( 55 % ) and a less@@ er extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination season of un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and all active metabolism is 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance are similar .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and apes agreed in after repeated plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac tro@@ phy .
this is due to that , in treating Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , reduced hyper@@ sp@@ emia and increased insulin resistance to the parent and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the dry growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ure@@ tic epithel@@ ium is induced .
in a animal model of the familiar Poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ o@@ din@@ itis led to a increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um@@ bles .
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
the calculated error response was 1,9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative drug .
in a further study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a statistically significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ves were observed in comparison to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the postoperative level tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , resulting in an effect on the tr@@ y@@ glyc@@ eride absorption , as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eride synthesis .

acet@@ ph@@ ane has been observed in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar level was similarly strongly reduced to other human insulin .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted , when combined with a number of other drugs , which can cause the blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove the Pack@@ ages ) .

Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d must not be used in patients who possibly are sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ pi@@ d may be adapted , when combined with a number of other medicines that can cause blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a approval for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the quantity of the quick @-@ acting insulin must be applied , then the quantity of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d included a dose adjustment in patients , this may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
before travelling , going on over several time zones , the patient should go on to take the advice of his physician , as such travel can result , insulin and meals must be applied or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the site of funds related - local over@@ estim@@ ations on the injec@@ tions during insulin therapy can occur local super@@ sensitive reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain , and hem@@ at@@ oma ) .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already identified signs of Kristall@@ deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ riff@@ ins ( &quot; stones &quot; that can result in greater primitive mass deposits , which can result in joint and fra@@ cture damages ) .
after two to four weeks , the ur@@ inary level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ imal , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during initial treatment months , gre@@ ed attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take at least for the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for the prevention of pois@@ ons .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transpl@@ ant because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , on which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo medications ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug to treat hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg per day ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
the main indication for the efficacy was the number of patients with their ur@@ inary ob@@ ac@@ id@@ ation in the blood of the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once a day of 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who once daily 120 mg had a ur@@ inary @-@ acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in contrast , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients were placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in history , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic might be more effective in lowering the urine in blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels s@@ bergen .
treatment of chronic hypertension in cases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history and / or a arthritis of arthritis ) .
when the serum concentration of 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose of dose can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety were not fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ domestic Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of Feb@@ . ost@@ asis is not recommended in this patient group .
organ transp@@ lan@@ ders since there are no experiences with organ transp@@ lan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ . ost@@ asis is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease For patients with chronic heart disease or compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other hard @-@ acid @-@ absor@@ bing medicines , it can occur during the treatment begin to a acute gyp@@ sy effect , because due to lowering the serum concentration , it may initially be mobi@@ lized in the tissues .
B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases are so far reaching that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials were observed with slight devi@@ ations of the liver function in patients treated with Feb@@ . 2 ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the February 2015 ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was were not performed in@@ effective studies on Feb@@ . ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing could lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a inhibit@@ ing of met@@ er@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were associated with the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ . ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times a day with a rise in the Feb@@ ot@@ o@@ static position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

in a study with subjects carried out 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily , an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak effect of Feb@@ . 6 to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous gest@@ ion of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , the intake of Feb@@ . ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) is delayed and a drop of C@@ max. by 32 % , but no significant change of AU@@ C results .

7 Open long @-@ time extensions studies have been treated with 906 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients with Feb@@ . 80 mg / 120 mg were treated .
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those mentioned in phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ot@@ o@@ static treatment groups in total more than once and compet@@ ed in patients receiving February 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) .
the following treatment related events were either reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were carried out with hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly recur@@ rent levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were given in each study .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg / dl or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um@@ kre@@ at@@ in@@ ct to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed in terms of reducing the serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as the treatment with conventional cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily , compared to treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering of the serum concentration on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed in the physician attendance in week 2 and maintained permanently on the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ purple in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al limit The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al limit ( d. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clinical significant differences in terms of the percentage of oxid@@ ation of serum levels , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with heavy kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a degree of serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in the first 3 years showed that the long @-@ term reduction in the serum concentration of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) showed a decrease in incidence of arthritis ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a cast @-@ out ) in the months 16 @-@ 24 .
this was associated with a reduction of gyp@@ sy @-@ size , resulting in 54 % of patients who had a complete disappearance of gre@@ cht@@ no@@ des until the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ . ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received in patients that received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ . ost@@ at to administration simpler and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for high doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise of AU@@ C is observed , greater than the dos@@ ing propor@@ tion@@ ular increase .
after taking a simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg of 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clinical correlation was observed in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration of serum concentration ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ . ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma derivatives of Feb@@ .@@ ux@@ e@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved over the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro @-@ studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ en demonstrated that these oxid@@ ative metabolism are formed predominantly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ . 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 are formed .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marking of February , approximately 49 % of the dose found in the urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ .

special care group kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC with mild , moderate or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ . ost@@ at did not change in proportion to volunteers with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ .@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 times from 7.5 m g / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 m ³ / ml in the group with heavy kidney function .
12 liver function limit After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ ugh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ P@@ ugh classification A ) or moderate limitation changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ . ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites do not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes related to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ . ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after intake multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , impair@@ ment of ferti@@ lization In male rats was found a statistically significant increase of urine bladder tum@@ ours ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ ome and lob@@ b@@ omas ) in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dosed group , with about 11 times the exposure of people found .
these findings are considered as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and ur@@ in@@ composition as a result of the clinical use as not relevant .
it has been noted that Feb@@ . ost@@ asis in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on ferti@@ lization and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses taken approximately at 4.@@ 3 times of the human@@ ist exposure , maternal tox@@ icity entered into a reduction in lowering performance and a development of development in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which were about 4.3 times and in supporting rab@@ bit with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human@@ ist exposure had no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are breeding ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk of low vitamin D mirrors exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or use of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitality supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not take up after the first food intake of the day , at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to investigate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , low ( 11 % ) compared to those that were only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data on the basis that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the movement apparatus ( muscles , bones , joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus ( diarrhea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , sc@@ anned Ab@@ dom@@ es ( blin@@ ded stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic re@@ ins .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or remove of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitality supplements ) for the day .
the following commands are closely follow to reduce the risk of ös@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed down only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cut the tablet or tablet into the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a consists . • The patients should not take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal ble@@ edings or surgical interventions in upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , be given only with special attention ( see Section 4.3 ) .
o@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations , rarely followed by anti @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al strings , were reported in patients suffering from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these severe and required a hospital ) .
the doctor should therefore attention to all the signs and symptoms that lead to potential anti @-@ ha@@ ha@@ ge@@ vity reaction , and the patients should be pointed out if the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of diarr@@ ho@@ bic irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ ie , pain in swal@@ lowing or a new or intensi@@ fied pressure on the medicine and to prevent medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe diarr@@ ho@@ bic side effects seems to be increased in patients who have not taken the medicine correctly and / or , according to the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point to an err@@ or@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that any dos@@ ing instructions will be given to the patient and to be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

the clinical assessment of the treated doctor is significant for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to have taken it during the taking of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet on the next morning , after they have noticed their off@@ ence .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned to continue the week of the week@@ day .

al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines may deterior@@ ate the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , the patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions .

Adv@@ oc@@ re is administered adult patients to prevent kidney or liver in order to prevent control of transp@@ lan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ant@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ is were compared .
the main indication of the efficacy was the number of patients , with which gra@@ ft was dis@@ rupted after a period of a year ( for example , for example , how often a new organ transpl@@ ant or re @-@ absorption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter trials were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ antation and analyzed , as Adv@@ ant@@ f is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .
Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ or ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and insom@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ ro@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components can not be used in advance .
patients and doctors must be careful if other ( particularly some vegetable ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Adv@@ ant@@ f , as the Adv@@ ance dose or the dose of the drug may be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ lan@@ ts should be able to arrange this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the tac@@ tical exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transp@@ lan@@ ces or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ contrac@@ tual or over@@ immune disease .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; the provisions of the formulation or regime should be performed only under tight control of one in the transpl@@ antation medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of this transition to alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations must be performed to ensure that the systematic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the Adv@@ ant@@ ages of Adv@@ ant@@ ations should be based on the clinical assessment of shock @-@ absor@@ bing and toler@@ ability in individual reduction ( see below &quot; recommendations )
after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ vari@@ us should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 , systemic exposure was measured as tal@@ ons , both in kidney and transpl@@ ant patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after the transpl@@ antation process , to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate reverse tran@@ s .
because tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ant@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
in case of the condition of the patient in the first postoperative phase , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application In the supp@@ ression of transp@@ lan@@ ces , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression has to be maintained ; therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy must not be specified .
dos@@ ing recommendations - kidney transpl@@ antation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transp@@ lan@@ tic corne@@ al expression should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose custom@@ iz@@ ations may be later required because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change during the stabil@@ isation of the patients after transpl@@ antation .
dos@@ ing recommendations - liver transpl@@ antation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transpl@@ ant supp@@ ression The oral Adv@@ ant@@ um therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dos@@ ing recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be converted to a daily dose of Adv@@ ant@@ f capsules twice daily , so this change@@ over in relation to the daily dose is 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant after switching from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ va on Adv@@ ant@@ f once daily the treatment must begin with the oral and liver transpl@@ antation recommended oral dos@@ ing for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transp@@ lan@@ ts .
heart transpl@@ ant for adult patients who can be converted to Adv@@ ant@@ ages is an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once a morning .
there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ant@@ aneous formulation from 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations in special care group patients with reduced liver function For maintaining the blood level mirror in the targeted range can be required in patients with heavy liver dysfunction a lowering of dosage .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not have an effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum levels , calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ hibit and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ oc@@ t At the switch from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ s@@ wine to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is required ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the valley levels in the whole blood the dose should be based on clinical assessment of shock @-@ shock and toler@@ ability in individual cases of thorough@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ ent@@ us @-@ stim@@ ulation controls .
it is recommended that controls the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ levels during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked after switching from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes of immune supp@@ ression therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ um is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , custom@@ iz@@ ations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials prove that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of tal@@ ons do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the rear @-@ view mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lies in the first time following liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and s@@ ne@@ eding - and heart @-@ transpl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transp@@ lan@@ ts were generally used as a rule of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including transpl@@ anting , or other side effects , which can occur in a sequ@@ el by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ stitution or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; the provisions of the formulation or regime should be performed only under tight control of one in the transpl@@ antation medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 . in the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft shock , which was shown to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ va as refra@@ c@@ tory studies , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation from the agra@@ phs .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of transp@@ lan@@ ts from adult heart transp@@ lan@@ ts and transp@@ lan@@ ts in childhood are still no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation from the agra@@ phs .
because of possible inter@@ actions which can result in lowering the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ b level in the blood and a reduction in the clinical efficacy of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the consumption of vegetable compounds ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) can be avoided , or other plant medicines during a treatment with Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , such as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ troph@@ ic , which , therefore , can also occur in Adv@@ ant@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are a treatment of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid loading , and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ va the effect of sunlight or UV light should be affected because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes through suitable clothing or use of solar protection with a high protection factor .
if patients who occupy the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of pre@@ s such as heada@@ ches , change of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision , should be radi@@ ographic examination ( e.@@ g ) .
because Adv@@ ant@@ ages hard capsules , lac@@ tose , lac@@ tose contain , in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ act@@ less int@@ oler@@ ance , Lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ less mal@@ absorption is offered special attention .
the simultaneous use of herbal medic@@ inal products or plant medicines , which are known as Hem@@ mer or In@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , thus reducing blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it is therefore recommended that the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels can change with the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining the same concentration ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was treated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal pollution .
highly regarded pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute waste reactions , can increase the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us affects the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines prescribed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism is affected .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us would reduce the ster@@ oid of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive and thereby raise the hormone ex@@ position , is particularly careful with decisions on recep@@ tive action .
the results of animal trials have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on , whose half @-@ level can extend .
the results of a small number of investigations to transp@@ lan@@ ts have no indication of having tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ va a increased risk of adverse events in relation to the process and result of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure there is a review of the new@@ bor@@ ns to be harmful to the harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; 0.@@ 37 ) and a Hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence is 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :

infections and paras@@ itic diseases As well known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ va is treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the vulner@@ ability of infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ k@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) frequently is increased .
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated Progressive Leu@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ant@@ f .
it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ icious ne@@ op@@ las@@ m including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mode of action and co@@ operative effects on molecular level should be convey@@ ed the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ onic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the connection of the connection in the cell phone .
this causes a calcium @-@ depend@@ ant inhibit@@ ing of signal transfer to T cells and thereby prevented the tran@@ scription of a certain series of ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the prolifer@@ ation of T cells , and the prolifer@@ ation of ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes cells ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor cells .
during the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ ant@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % was approved as well as in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 234 ) , it was 29.@@ 3 % .

kidney transpl@@ antation The efficacy and safety of Adv@@ ant@@ ages and pro@@ gra@@ f was compared to each combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , compared with 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transpl@@ antation .
patients survival rates for 12 months were 9@@ 6.9 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the adv@@ an@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) deaths .

the incidence of therapy after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy confirmed rep@@ ul@@ ence or missing follow @-@ up data ) came to 14.@@ 0 % in the Adv@@ ant@@ f group ( N = 212 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ in Group ( N = 212 ) .
the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ ant@@ ine c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) for Adv@@ ant@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % Con@@ fic@@ tional interval &#91; -@@ 8.9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .

published results of the primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the form of twice daily pro@@ gra@@ f capsules according to other primary body transp@@ lan@@ ts , developed to form pancre@@ as , lung and intest@@ ine transpl@@ ant@@ ations .
175 l@@ ung@@ ized patients , with 4@@ 75 patients under@@ min@@ ate a pancre@@ as plant and 630 cases , after a intestinal transpl@@ ant , used as a primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ sive disorder .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies reported the observations in the major studies where pro@@ gra@@ f in liver , ren@@ al and cardi@@ ac transp@@ lan@@ ts were applied to the primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression .
lung transpl@@ ant in an interim report on a recently conducted , multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or c@@ ic@@ los@@ se in the frame of a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ isation .
chronic transp@@ lan@@ ces , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ation syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after transpl@@ antation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases linked to the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis o@@ bl@@ iter@@ an compared to 3@@ 8.0 % compared to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ is had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients receiving by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ is ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there came to no acute transp@@ lan@@ ts was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transpl@@ ant patients with the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group bigger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transp@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) .
in a study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis is o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - Syn@@ dro@@ ms treated significantly with the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us patients .
pancre@@ as antation A multic@@ entr@@ e study was performed on 205 Pati@@ ents , which simultaneously underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transpl@@ antation , which received after a random@@ ized process Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the mar@@ gins of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal transp@@ lan@@ ts The published clinical outcome of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al gra@@ ft ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on an update rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ ines , additional gift of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor ant@@ agon@@ ist Dac@@ lizumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to valley mirror ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase of un@@ born faction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or to be responsible for treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the transpl@@ antation of higher cle@@ aring rates .
this lets you conclude that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabol@@ ised before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the G@@ alle .
for stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was lower than the mar@@ grave of 10 % lower than the mar@@ grave .
it is recommended that controls the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ levels during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft examination , which was shown to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ va as refra@@ c@@ tory studies , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ant formulation from the agra@@ phs .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are a treatment of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid loading , and ede@@ ma .
during the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ ant@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % was approved as well as in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 234 ) , it was 29.@@ 3 % .

adv@@ ances will be used to treat and proph@@ eci@@ es in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ation disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of application will be addressed to whether Adv@@ ant@@ ations are applied to the treatment of bleeding or proph@@ eci@@ es in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII , causing blood cl@@ ung problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method that is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) which enabled them to the formation of the human body factor VIII .
adv@@ ances is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently , so the drug contains no protein of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of medication used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of the new blood @-@ sep@@ tic tank were awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well &quot; evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ phy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances must not be used in patients who possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against human g@@ inn@@ ess factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to grant Adv@@ ate Adv@@ ices of Adv@@ ate Adv@@ ant@@ ations throughout the European Union .
dosage The dose and duration of the sub@@ stitution enabled after the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of the patient and the clinical state of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall under the stated plasma level ( in % of the norm or in 2008 / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years old ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer to repeat until pain and acute damage are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment period , the appropriate dose and incidence of injec@@ tions is an appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ing .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different semi @-@ value levels .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long term proph@@ yla@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses ranging from 20 to 40 by factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
in case the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not ruled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ate an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that factor VIII &apos;s therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed .
the appointment speed should be addressed by the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , taking risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days of the biggest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and am@@ ne@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , observed from ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women over the use of factor VIII , during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding no experiences .
the A@@ DR@@ s inhibit@@ ors were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all present at previously untreated patients who have higher risk for formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 up to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ( b ) , the unexpected apost@@ asy of the onset of blood pressure factor VIII ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ots has been maintained throughout the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th day postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 kids and adults 2 with diagnosed heavier hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or of inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da ) .
in addition , no one of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed after exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in the previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameter , and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant up@@ lifting and persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell in protein , otherwise , no signs or symptoms appear on an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to an allergic reaction .
in four patients the occurr@@ ence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes was reported in several repeated product positions within the study .
7 . in case of other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported by the allergic type , including an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII is active as a factor factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in untreated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basis value factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the first permitted data , the CH@@ MP has continued the benefit of the benefits of the benefit of the benefits , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has required a solution of P@@ SU@@ Rs at the base of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is required to apply for authorisation in 5 years to apply for the approval process in another 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited divided the Committee for Human@@ itarian Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) that the company returns its application for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissues , the other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and leans feet ) .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; that has been changed so that there are no copies of themselves , and therefore no infection can trigger in people .
adv@@ an@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from which is not defective in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene , is normally bearing to restoration damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can &apos;t be restored .
when Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer is defective in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient before Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP has examined the answers to those questions asked , there were still some issues un@@ explained .
based on the evaluation of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP has generated a list of questions related to the company .
the CH@@ MP opinion has not been proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors will take advantage of the patients .
the committee also concerns concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven enough for adv@@ ancing in a reliable way , and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is harmful .
the CH@@ MP did not know it whether the consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed hormone release &quot; means that the tablets are so sum@@ mon@@ ed , that one of the most effective elements are released immediately and the other is released for several hours .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever caused by a allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ al sul@@ fur ( clo@@ g@@ ged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years from age 12 , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily such a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( clo@@ g@@ ged nose ) .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medication can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the major effect dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms that were reported in the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , the patients carried their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal , and evaluate the symptoms in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported cases , the aer@@ onau@@ ts income , above a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was viewed , the patient showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , t@@ yn@@ g@@ itis , dizziness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ less@@ ness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ itis ( lack of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ itis ( sle@@ epl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sle@@ epl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze may not be used with patients who may possibly be ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , or one of the other components , against ad@@ r@@ ins@@ ist active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different medic@@ inal medicines for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from hyper@@ ton@@ ic glaucoma ( increased eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ gi@@ osis ( exc@@ use of thy@@ roid ) or have already had a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for marketing of aer@@ onau@@ ts throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without having to break , break or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the absence of data on in@@ convenience and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as during long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take away .
after decl@@ ining the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy .

this is due to the alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , per@@ go@@ lid , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ h@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver problems and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce relevant recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment in treating hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as heada@@ ches or rein@@ forcement of heada@@ ches ) must be removed .
treatment in treating the following patient groups is required : • Pati@@ ents in digital life • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hy@@ m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ nese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder transpl@@ ant or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ ita in the history of the patients .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before implementation of mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction and can reduce in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes in plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in case of the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between the patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo treated patients were detected , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not identified , so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vitro CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ convenience of application of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however does not increase the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients should , however , be clari@@ fied in this rare cases that it may occur in very rare cases to a ful@@ lest type of transport or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ or , con@@ vul@@ sions ) .

these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stur@@ cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhes@@ ion P @-@ selection on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement capacities of the flu@@ x , including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective determination or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no higher frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause more person@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were received .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ ist efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines the basis of the total co@@ res for the symp@@ tom ( except for nas@@ al s@@ mu@@ cos@@ ine sul@@ fur ) , significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in terms of degra@@ dation effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ m@@ ess , was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week period of treatment .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in was reached in day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ ing study , which was carried out with the formulation of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly mis@@ sive .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in bio@@ equivalent was the ex@@ position of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies of security vulner@@ ology , for tox@@ icity at repet@@ itive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine makes no specific dangers for the human being .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity as their individual components , and the effects observed in general in connection with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reproductive @-@ ox@@ ic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day are not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .

for children ages 1 to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , the dose of 2.5 ml syrup or b .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in form of 5 m@@ l. or syrup .
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of add@@ ings , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup , the solution to remove and the tablets in the same way as the tablets and application for children is un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to a mean decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us within the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in teenagers from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be eff@@ ected in accordance with the previous symptoms of disease and can be resum@@ ed after the sound of symptoms and resum@@ ed .
persi@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergi@@ es time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were found in the context of clinical studies involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the effectiveness of alco@@ hol@@ us and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should , however , be clari@@ fied in this rare cases that it may occur in very rare cases , which can result in impair@@ ment of transport or the ability to control machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported on the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when patients who were treated with placebo .
the most frequently observed side effects , which was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , th@@ at@@ op@@ enn@@ ess ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side effect was heada@@ ches , with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , and with 6.9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clinical effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ stur@@ cells / bas@@ oph@@ ile as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhes@@ ion P @-@ sel@@ ess on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for more than 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval revealed .
in an individual dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement capacities of the flu@@ x , including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective determination or the tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in treating the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ve and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Per@@ sist@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as seen from the total co@@ res of the questionnaire to the quality of life in rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ i , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the severe allergic rhin@@ itis in oc@@ top@@ ical rhin@@ itis .
chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been demonstr@@ ating for further forms of the Ur@@ sel@@ aria , as the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology im@@ perc@@ ep@@ ts the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of etching with different forms , and chronic patients can be made easier to recru@@ it .
since the hist@@ amine @-@ release is a vital factor in all prim@@ eval diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine leads to an improvement in the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of con@@ tik@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidance .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ chy of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and eness significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale on evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no basis points for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not been identified , however , that inter@@ actions with other drugs are not excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in an individual dos@@ ing study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ thal@@ ates , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) do not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies showed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to tox@@ icity fil@@ s by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on the conventional studies for security vulner@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin let no specific dangers for the human being .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken ir@@ respective of meals , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the in@@ descri@@ b@@ able doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are pre@@ valent which support treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination , and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children aged 2 to 11 , metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ st@@ amping load ( see paragraph 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 , restric@@ ts to metabolic syndrome , is identical to children who are regularly to metabolic .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ less absorption or a su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the effectiveness of alcohol is not ampli@@ fied when taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , like in the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us when patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were given , no clinical effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who came into question for anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ al dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the development of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is similar in adults and children , the in@@ ability data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults in adults .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us pills resulted in adults and adolescents in clinical trials for no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , an increase of alcohol induced or an ampli@@ fication of alcohol induced or intensi@@ fying the drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as riv@@ eting , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching , nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of eyes and it@@ ching on the palate .
as seen from the total co@@ res of the questionnaire to quality of life in rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ i , A@@ eri@@ us pills effectively produces allergic rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the lowering of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the prevalence of this reduced phen@@ otyp@@ ing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than Caucas@@ ian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the syrup form@@ ulating in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are to be described .
load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was approximately 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4 times higher with a season half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no basis points for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was comparable to the recommended dos@@ ages of recommended doses of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not identified , however , that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us syrup is available in type III bra@@ ckets with child@@ proof polypropylene @-@ sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at once a day take daily in the mouth , to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
just before the application , the bli@@ ster needs to be carefully opened and the dose of ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ ats must be taken from , without dam@@ aging them .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not established in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have been applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported on the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
no clinical effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ inet@@ een clinical dose ) were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at has been well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical tests , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple doses , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 mg daily has been applied daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no higher frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was detected in comparison to placebo .

there are limited experience from clinical trials for the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in teenagers from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
just before the application , the bli@@ ster needs to be carefully opened and the dose of melt tablet will be taken without damage .
the efficacy and in@@ convenience of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the total rigi@@ dity of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup and the placebo group was equal and did not significantly increase the safety profile .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be the equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets @-@ formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ oph@@ il@@ is@@ at for the prefer@@ ential formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .

Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially distributed to the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) in June 2008 that the company returns its application for approval from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older men for protecting flu that is caused by the influenza A virus ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which may cause a strain of influenza that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out if a new strain of influenza virus is affected , which can be easily spreading from human beings because human beings do not have any immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and antibodies to the immune system .
this makes the immune system later in a position to form a contact with a influenza virus this family fast antibodies .
subsequently the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the surface of membran@@ es that det@@ ects the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , cleaned up , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study sites revealed that the study was not performed in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this makes the scope of clinical data base for evaluation of the safety of the vaccine not to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre@@ destined vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in an clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your treatment doctor .
if you wish to read more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also constitu@@ ent of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years using the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generic ase is available as a solution for ob@@ taining , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r as the safety of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ generic ase should only be appointed if the physician has examined the an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has judged that the virus is on the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines will be taken .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ac@@ upun@@ cture is aimed according to body@@ weight .
as@@ ur@@ ase reduces taking in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not cure diseases , however , the damage of the immune system , thus helping to carry out the development of AIDS diseases and diseases .
A@@ generic ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r , studied in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with imp@@ eas@@ ants .
this was compared with low do@@ si@@ ded Rit@@ on@@ b@@ avi@@ r increased medic@@ inal medicines for 206 adults , which had been taken before prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indication for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than in placebo , but at@@ ype was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but had been treated by the children who had previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few on treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load of the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment was equally effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ generic ase to a more powerful tr@@ ash of the viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of A@@ generic ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( diarrhea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 as@@ pi@@ ase must not be used in patients who possibly are ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
ac@@ upun@@ ase must also not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are min@@ ed as as@@ se@@ ase and are beneficial in high concentrations in the blood .
as in other drugs against HIV consists of patients who are taking a@@ gener@@ a ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ yst@@ ro@@ ar ( extin@@ ction of bone mass ) or an immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the rest@@ ra@@ ging immune system ) .
the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of as@@ gener@@ a used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of patients treated with HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years .
ac@@ upun@@ ase will usually be taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of ac@@ upun@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not been taken inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or .
A@@ generic ase was originally approved in &quot; outstanding circumstances , &quot; because of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a approval for placing on the market in the European Union .
A@@ generic ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children 4 years old .
typically , A@@ generic capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ bs of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r should be taken into account taking into consideration the individual viral resistance sample and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of b@@ lown avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ out is 14 % less than of b@@ lown avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ generic tablets and solution for inser@@ ting to a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ac@@ upun@@ cture capsules is 600 mg of b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 . if a@@ Gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ for@@ cing addition of p@@ avi@@ onic avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ac@@ upun@@ cture capsules is 20 mg of b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ b@@ ital , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ se@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined in children .
A@@ generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data on in@@ convenience and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , adult dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver problems it contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generic ase cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) sub@@ str@@ ates .
vegetable preparations , the St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of b@@ lown avi@@ r during taking am@@ b@@ b@@ ins ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to the healing of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or any other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ac@@ upun@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of liver failure with potential fatal approaches .
for the case of a simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the content of this medicine .
patients with existing h@@ ep@@ tive liver function , including a chronic active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ generic ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glucose levels which are handled over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of a treatment reduces the risk of systemic co@@ hes@@ itation effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the sub@@ sid@@ y function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the sub@@ stitution of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin highly dependent of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended to con@@ sign@@ ment a@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ tics .
4 . for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standard debt ratio ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective for reduced plasma concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ ction can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ pi@@ at@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r .

conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analysis , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ or resistant to isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
each of these four associated with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cruci@@ fix@@ ion against Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ sil@@ hou@@ r resist@@ ors , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral diseases , including an incidence of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 Isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; receiving this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations into limits that can im@@ pose the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of ac@@ upun@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 mg twice daily ) with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nu@@ cle@@ o@@ sid@@ y ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with lowest arm@@ oured ri@@ ot &quot; geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ert . &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the sub@@ category A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis proved the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time adjusted aver@@ aging the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ target wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of non @-@ poll@@ ed as@@ se@@ ase is based on two controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution was taken twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was not given to low do@@ si@@ bly kn@@ uck@@ les at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients had enrolled plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 B@@ ased on these data should be considered in the treatment optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated benefits of &quot; uns@@ af@@ oo@@ ed &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
according to oral administration , the average duration ( max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max , reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of b@@ lown avi@@ r 12 hours to dose ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( c@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the con@@ current consumption affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ b@@ b@@ ins from the blood stream in the tissue .
this change causes a decrease in the total concentration of the effectiveness in plasma , with the quantity of un@@ connected Am@@ b@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which remains the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remained constant , the percentage of the free active ingredient during the dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State is over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason you have to in@@ duce or in@@ hib@@ ited the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are simultaneously administered with A@@ generic ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 , and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ generic tablets , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ b@@ ital exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made up of the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and at@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar basis .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al impair@@ ment should be low to elimination of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r .
these treatment steps lead to Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r plasma screens , comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r twice daily with no simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with b@@ lown avi@@ r in mice and rats compet@@ es in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ oma in dos@@ ages caused by the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r .
the 21 @-@ based mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ocy@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ oms and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on people , both in clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation tests , micro@@ idal test of rats and chromosome test at human periph@@ eral ly@@ mpho@@ cy@@ tes was included , Am@@ b@@ b@@ r was neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T , and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ generic ase nor after the treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in young , treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality rate , both at the controls and with am@@ b@@ b@@ lown animals .
at a systemic plasma position , significantly higher ( rabbits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic doses of humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus sound and minor skel@@ eton changes were observed , pointing to a delayed development .
24 . if A@@ wes@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ for@@ cing addition of p@@ avi@@ onic avi@@ r ( Boo@@ bs ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for ac@@ upun@@ cture capsules is 20 mg of b@@ lown ca@@ vi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of am@@ b@@ ital , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous application should be done in patients with weak or light liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver problems it contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standard debt ratio ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ ur@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a cereb@@ ro@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated with metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction of the AU@@ C of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resistance development .

the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis in the fore@@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application purpose , therefore , such an application is not recommended .
local corporate transactions often occur frequently , but these reactions take normally back during the therapy to intensity or go back after putting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reaction of the patient may cause great dis@@ comfort , or are very strong , the treatment can be suspended for several days .
out of the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acc@@ ents are treated with less than 8 les@@ ions than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area .
the extraordinary unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could result in nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred in several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , the systemic treatment of in@@ filtr@@ ation and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 permissible phase 3 efficacy studies , it could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete compensation of in@@ clin@@ ations over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses of dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimum systematic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drugs concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ alled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face on the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time period according to the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this points to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the medicine in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has been low in patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to patients with healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super @-@ cell carcin@@ oma .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness were measured ( by its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms lowered the concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , arth@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the fusion site .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who possibly are highly sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update all new information every year , which may be known , exam@@ ining and updating this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is received to observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who observe reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ enzyme Europe B.@@ V. a approval for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ oid α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated on the long @-@ term cy@@ top@@ ical therapy in patients with sigh@@ ted diagnosis of a Mu@@ gen@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a physician , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be enhanced when the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as each in relation to the side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be monitored , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be made available only in an appropriate clinical setting , where medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , we expect almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment beginning .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption , risks must be pre @-@ treated due to the theoretical risk reaction after a termination of treatment .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ thesis ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of light or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be applied and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , serious in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms were reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be absorbed again with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the past reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists .
animal experiments does not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ on@@ ated against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase above the breast milk , is recommended to not feeding during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical trials were identified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years are very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory trac@@ ts and lungs in the history of history , there were heavy reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory failure and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in the table with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients and a duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after onset of treatment to a Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , with the patients at the age of 5 , with a heavier comparison form occurred ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ lan@@ ces ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients , with whom it has never occurred to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version .
patients with lack of low @-@ body levels have a robust reduction in the mirror mirror in Har@@ n , whereas patients with high antibody tit@@ res were a variable reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low neutr@@ alised effects on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ - activity in vitro , which seemed to neg@@ atively affected the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in the urine .
the presence of antibodies appeared not to stand in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse medicine reactions typically occurred with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for en@@ mer@@ isation therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and preventing a further accumulation of adequate power induc@@ t@@ ance .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells of cells into the ly@@ n@@ os@@ omes most likely over Mann@@ i @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , which had referred to the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited when they had a for@@ c@@ apped exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label renewal study , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the placebo group improving lung function and the ability to appear in the following table .
in an open renewal study , improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks showed in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group , and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ thir@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further to the body @-@ size growing children .
of the 26 patients with one hepatitis alie ( 85 % ) achieved a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear tr@@ ash of the g@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n ( µg / mg of the Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was established , which remained constant at the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients that has been taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes has been summar@@ ized for five efficacy variable ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients , who had been under the age of 5 ( 16 patients with the heavy @-@ run form and 4 with the medium @-@ run form ) .
in four cases , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was found according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle ening form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe de@@ formation , only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study investigations into the co@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ atics were performed on the g@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks , patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions can represent a acceptable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent to equal value .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will provide any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less affected patients .

the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin transactions must be given the day before and during the day after the treatment of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken , and the intake should be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients must also receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third movement .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood picture should be created before each offering , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ ocy@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ cy@@ tes .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 times the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose must be held under auth@@ oriz@@ ations of blood @-@ balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ - or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degrees 2 blood .
if patients are non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of equal to 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient to obtain the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurr@@ ence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above , compared to patients at the age of 65 , an increased minor effect is achieved .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ convenience and efficacy .
in clinical studies , patients with a placebo @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need to be dose @-@ custom@@ iz@@ ations required for all patients recommended dose custom@@ iz@@ ations .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; to 1.5 times the upper bi@@ li@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( in case of liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit ( in presence of liver metast@@ asis ) are not investigated especially in the studies .
patients must not be monitored in relation to the bone of the bone and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ alistic number reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes decreased a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neutral number of neutr@@ ality , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as it was observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and anti @-@ inflammatory tox@@ icity like neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was be@@ at@@ o- , when a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients must be instructed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , folic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ etic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid logic ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ d@@ tea ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients receiving a combination with P@@ em@@ et@@ mixed is required to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ root ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients that occurred these events , related risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ defined blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients suffering from clin@@ ically significant liquid collection in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion of the mixed @-@ mixed treatment should be considered .
5 severe cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ature events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally , if this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of weigh@@ ting life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shepherd , the reproductive ability is made by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be noted before treatment - casting therein , advice on sperm preser@@ vation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ logi@@ st@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ root ex@@ position result in a reduced occurr@@ ence of side effects .
therefore , caution occurs when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and mint , 2 days after therapy should be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the inter@@ ac@@ tionary potential of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ level as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on day of therapy , and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ root .
the big in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of net status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ last@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standard debt ratio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but like an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected to be severe birth defects in the pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed can not be applied during pregnancy , except when necessarily , and after careful defense for the mother and risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible de@@ fo@@ al of reproductive ability is caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be rejected before the treatment beginning , advice on the sperm counter .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ mixed in breast milk leaves and un@@ wanted effects when the nursing infant cannot be excluded .

the probability of occurr@@ ence gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can result in a improved metabolic inspection , patients who take a drug with diabetes before the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted .
patients who have all@@ i and medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels should be taken to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , whether the dosage can be adjusted to this medicine .
it is recommended to meet additional weak@@ ening reaction measures in order to prevent the oral contra@@ ction in the case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in one study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the c@@ ic@@ los@@ is plasma is observed .
in use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally norm@@ ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .

however , patients should be recommended , before bed@@ time a supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement must be taken ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a disposable dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments are no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and depend on pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of imported fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were determined in clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years , generally slight and temporary .
the boxes are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequencies based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects , which were determined after the launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported from a population of un@@ certainty .

the therapeutic effect sets up in the l@@ umen of Mag@@ ens and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of gast@@ ric and pan@@ atic lip@@ ses .
clinical studies was derived from 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fet@@ ched fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of participants lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed for 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average rating in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

overweight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of the emergence of different severe diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • cereb@@ ral diseases • Exc@@ essive canc@@ ers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your physician about your risk for these diseases .
a durable weight loss , for example through improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious illness and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to live permanently healthy .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les which you also find as an indication of the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories should take you maximum per day .
please note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which is appropriate for you , take the below information , which gives the number of calories which is suitable for you . • Up@@ on the mode of action of the capsule , the adher@@ ence of the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as far as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by maintaining the recommended grease supply , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and decrease the probability of cardiovascular @-@ related subjects . • You should try to gradually increase .
34 So this reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight , continuously , and to develop continuously about 0.5 kg a week without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Ger@@ inge physical activity &quot; means that you can work daily only little or even if you burn up daily 150 kcal per day , i.e. by 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gar@@ dening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a durable weight loss , it is necessary to put yourself realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat targets and ensure that it is useful . • Su@@ itable is a nutrition journal with information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for the support of weight loss combined the capsules with a feed plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ ori@@ - and fet@@ ishes , to feed physical activity and be physically active .
in combination with one on your type of cut program to support the weight loss , you can help you to develop a heal@@ th@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your objective .
Alo@@ xi is used in chemical therapies , which are strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , and in chemical therapies ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group does not provide enough information .
this means that the active substance is the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are severe and severe trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting .
in chemotherapy alone , 59 % of those patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours following chemotherapy alone ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy alone , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy alone ( 153 from 189 ) , compared with 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these figures were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the whole European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xes : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer illnesses and vomiting in excess em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy based on cancer illnesses .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on age , patients should be monitored with an am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor ant@@ agon@@ ists , caution is required for simultaneous use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval , or in patients with whom the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or tend to be an extended extension .
in connection with a further chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi is said to be used neither to treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ r@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in one population based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ D@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , D@@ ox@@ et@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , oxid@@ ant , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) did not have any significant impact on the cle@@ aring of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the treatment doctor .
in clinical trials , the most commonly observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least possibly stood in connection with Alo@@ xi ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of trans@@ iti@@ vity reactions and reactions to the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .

no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably is probably no effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .

results of the trials involving moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study were summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indications chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the appropriate effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings in clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the patient &apos;s vent@@ ric@@ ular channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out with 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ v. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentration will follow an slow elimination of elimination of the body with an average end time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally used in the whole dose of 0.@@ 3- 90 m g / kg for healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the median average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma stress concentrations at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations come out that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in three consecutive days reached total position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was comparable to one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time limit of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated in the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect of the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro @-@ vitro studies for metabol@@ ites have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose found within 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered ingredient that made some 40 % of the given dose .
after a single intraven@@ ous bolt @-@ projection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver problems , the termin@@ ale elimination season and the average system exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ ist exposure that indicates a low relevance to clinical use .
10 . from prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , however , that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can be blocked only in very high concentrations of ion@@ ic channels that can be involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure of man ) that were given every day over two years , resulted in increased incidence of liver tumor , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , ad@@ non WB ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is given for unique application , the relevance of these results will be dimin@@ ished for people .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Immun@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative app@@ rais@@ al , in which the approval of the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C ( Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution ) .
this means that Alph@@ eon was supposed to be similar to a biological drug called R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A with the same medication @-@ effective component that is already approved in the EU ( also called reference sel@@ ective ) .
Alph@@ eon was to be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one of the virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue demonstrates damage , moreover , the values of the liver cycle Al@@ an@@ in Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was initiated , which stim@@ ulates this to the formation of active ingredients .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data that prove the comparison of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of mode , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with Hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference age by 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study , the drug was measured after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjust@@ ing the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

further concerns were expressed , that the data on stability of the drug and the drug was not sufficient .
the number of patients with Hepatitis C related to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A was similar in clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon the disease was ret@@ ard@@ ant in more patients than with reference fe@@ ed@@ ance ; also Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test was used in the study to investigate the question , where the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a cr@@ ate formation of incoming skin infection ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ities ( R@@ iss@@ - or snor@@ kel@@ et ) , ab@@ di@@ ces and wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for treating infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go is not effective against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months but patients under the age of 18 must not be more than 2 % of body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should further examine the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes ( parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle where proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indication of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was dis@@ band@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,1 % ) of 71 patients suffering from placebo were treated to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of patients were applied for the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that al@@ tar@@ ry was diagnosed with the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( cav@@ ities in body tissues ) or of infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order of the contract .
the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections are against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , di@@ ces or wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for placing al@@ loc@@ o in the whole European Union .
the patients , which shows no improvement within two to three days , are to be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sens@@ it@@ isation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment shall be ab@@ orted to the treatment carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infection in which M@@ RSA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary infected wounds , the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) were in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to low plasma concentration , which were achieved in humans according to top@@ ical use on isolated skin or infected surface , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition is not expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 The average re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AC@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application increased from 2 times daily , and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % retin@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased to a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low system exposure according to top@@ ical application in patients , dose custom@@ iz@@ ations are not required if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction x@@ icity of oral intake and are in@@ adequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin at the gift of a systemic antibiot@@ ic regim@@ ent is .
in deci@@ ding whether the breast@@ feeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued to be finished , is between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy to women .
in clinical studies on 2@@ 150 patients suffering from superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go had applied , the most commonly reported adverse event of irrit@@ ation at the administration site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of mode of retin@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is separated from fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ icus ( former Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a specific binding of the 50s sub@@ sid@@ y of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes which differ from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ al anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ .com region .
by connecting to this bin@@ ocular tumor , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , blocking part P @-@ related inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
should be due to the local prevalence of the resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , should provide advice through experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine , Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was initiated every day under a oc@@ clu@@ sion and reduced the skin for up to 7 days .
5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary in@@ trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic recording in man according to top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the in@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days there were indications of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid .

ambient temperature is used for the protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is used within two doses of an existing vaccine , but a protection against hepatitis B may not be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , you can only use Ambi@@ rix if the risk of hepatitis B infection is made and ensured that the vaccination can be taken at the end of two doses .
if a refresh@@ ment dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or -@@ B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by protecting the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
ambient rix also contains the same components such as the vaccine V@@ rix Ad@@ ults and has been approved by the V@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in one of three doses of an existing vaccine .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the use of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults , also used as proof for the use of ambient rix .
the main indication for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody @-@ concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six @-@ month range and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
ambi@@ rix took place between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar in a hex@@ ag@@ onal and a 12 @-@ month distance between the injec@@ tions .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain on the injec@@ tions , redness , mat@@ eness ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not react sensiti@@ vely to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) , not applied .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ica s.@@ a. approval for the placing on the market .
the standardi@@ zation plan for the under@@ di@@ zation of ambient beats is made up of two vacc@@ inations , the first dose of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refresh@@ er is desired both for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) antibody @-@ antibody index values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not totally secured whether immun@@ otherapy persons , which are addressed to a hepatitis A vaccine , may require a refresh@@ er than protection , since it may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory as well .
3 As for all injec@@ tions , for the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine there is appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always available .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation of hepatitis B is recommended to be able to form 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody is achieved so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines may be required .
as a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration might lead to an sub@@ optimal vaccination program , this injection methods should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or bleeding problems , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected once sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases when in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration may occur .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same age of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps V@@ öt@@ t@@ ine vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immune disease , or in patients suffering from immun@@ ity , possibly no sufficient immun@@ ity response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination doses of this formulation , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ology , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former thi@@ omer@@ ised and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ines .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the toler@@ ability of ambient ag@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing combination dies .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and distur@@ b@@ ance on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed according to the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.8 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who received the Ambi@@ rix have been vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ inated .
however , incidence of matt@@ resses was comparable high ( i.e. about the total vaccination cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects , the ambient temperature were compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans combination fluid ) .
the incidence of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and fulness was low and comparable to , that was observed after administration of the Combin@@ ation vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurr@@ ence of local reactions and general reactions were comparable to the ambient temperature in the Ambi@@ ence group with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , vaccination with ambient beats a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( on the injec@@ table ) per dose , not per tape , reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination case of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units with the combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statistically not different .
in clinical trials which were carried out in vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years , the anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ h@@ bs rate for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vacc@@ inated with three doses .
the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose regim@@ es was significantly higher than the ambient temperature .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 year olds a month after the end of the full vaccination series ( i.e. a month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines either received a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies were detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient atmosphere in 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vacc@@ ines .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those , which were determined after vaccination of 3 doses of a combin@@ ant Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to that in 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
if the first dose of ambient rix took place at the same time with the finding of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation for adults , shown for current formulation @-@ like ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum samples such as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine will be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ se by eye @-@ loss of any foreign exchange and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverage , but can also be transmitted by other ways like by bathing in the water @-@ contam@@ inated waters .
they can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly need a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix not completely protect you from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even when the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are already infected / your child before the administration of both vaccination ambi@@ rix already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( though you feel un@@ comfortable or feel un@@ comfortable or feel / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent illness .
a protection against other infection that may harm the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If any allergic reaction to you / your child once again has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself by it@@ ching skin env@@ elop@@ es , breath of breath or swelling of your face or tongue . • If in you / your child has occurred once an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / her child has a severe infection with a fever / her .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and usually the second vaccination dose ) is required .
with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it is recommended to you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine , with reduced content of effective substances , is usually administered a month after the first dose , and should give you a vaccination protection from the end of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected when people suffer from severe bleeding problems under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your own immune defence / or if you / your child ten@@ ded to under@@ go a hem@@ or@@ se .
ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine can &apos;t be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Please take your doctor if you / her child will take another medicine if you have been vacc@@ inated ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated without any prescription ? or if you have given birth to immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or that he is planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient , and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine will be given at Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and different lim@@ bs .
if ambient rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficiently adequate .
typically , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women are not given , except it is urgent that it is vacc@@ inated in both hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if in you / your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you / your child greatly imp@@ aired or you noticed any side effects , which are not given in this package form .
ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs up to 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has become known since issu@@ ing the first approval for the marketing , the CH@@ MP compar@@ es that the value @-@ risk ratio for ambient temperature is positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited to small patient ex@@ position .
Ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with a complete en@@ cephal@@ y effect , or with hyper@@ ton@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage to high concentrations of ammon@@ i@@ ak@@ concentrations ) in the history .
ammon@@ ite is divided into several single doses to meals - sho@@ cked , mixed with food , or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ too ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) and a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
this was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ dy could not be compared to another treatment or placebo ( an apparent drug , i.e. without the active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ite may also contribute to appetite , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid re@@ jection , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee for Human@@ ist P@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urine cycle could be effective .
Ammon@@ aps was approved in &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the rare circumstances of the disease only limited information on this drug was given .
the action is indicated in all patients , with which a complete en@@ m@@ man@@ gel is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 living days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifested form ( a complete enzyme that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first age of life ) there is an indication for the use when in the history of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , suitable for infants , who are not able to swal@@ low pills or for patients with swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine suffer from a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required at an early mani@@ f@@ eit@@ ing deficiency .
patients with a Argin@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ Syn@@ ase deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 to 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing , as an risk for orig@@ ination of o@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a is when tablets were not immediately coming into the stomach .
each tablet of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) of sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium a 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ bean , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
thus , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with con@@ genital heart failure or severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and eye @-@ forming clinical conditions , only with caution .
since metabolism and separation of sodium poly@@ ph@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ bean over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
for sub@@ cut@@ aneous offering of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural prolifer@@ ation and to an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also resulted in a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in human breast milk will be eliminated , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during stand@@ still time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ wanted events has been assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an impro@@ b@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid outlet , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 months old infant with a special single dose of 10 grams ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go coinci@@ ded with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed a dos@@ is@@ mal neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity at a intraven@@ ous dos@@ ing of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a metabolic active link which con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contained 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative straps for the separation of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dys@@ functions from the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram of genom@@ ic sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ bean between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen are produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is pre@@ mat@@ urely and the treatment is immediately begun to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the occurr@@ ence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ lows , and the disease led himself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nit@@ ric @-@ free anal@@ ogues after the first year of life .
due to hem@@ i@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ ric acid separation ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , protein reduced the diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born cases ( however within the first month of life ) .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it came with the time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifested form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ical form of Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly carb@@ ons am@@ yl@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) , that were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ lic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and permanently treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ric , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidneys enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after the gift of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at for a single dose of 5 grams of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ bean and treated with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in tablets , 15 minutes after taking plac@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the next morning , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in plasma using different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were repeated having been treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration on the third day was five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ position The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses treated rats ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules is either taken by oral ( babies and children who can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with si@@ bl@@ ance ) or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ too or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde .
according to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine suffer from a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required at an early mani@@ f@@ eit@@ ing deficiency .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium a 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ bean , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat liver were exposed before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active met@@ abo@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the c@@ ort@@ ex .
an impro@@ b@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid outlet , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both compounds contained 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative backing for the separation of excess
based on studies on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram of genom@@ ic sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ bean between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases , a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking plac@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
with this proposal , the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at .
if a patient has to obtain the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at is up to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , such liver enzymes are missing , so that they can accum@@ ulate the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that can accum@@ ulate in consumption after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are carried out in your laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium poly@@ ph@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during stand@@ still time , you can &apos;t take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS while the medicine could move into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disorders , after@@ no@@ bility , memory disorders , memory disorders , and a deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you find any of these symptoms , you are immediately set up with your doctor or the emergency intake of your hospital in an introduction to an appropriate treatment .
after taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes of bleeding ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ at@@ ocy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , kidney problems , weight gain and abnormal lab values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you are greatly imp@@ aired or you noticed any side effects that are not stated in this manual information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the case on the box and the refriger@@ ation after &quot; applicable up to &quot; stated date of exp@@ iry date .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the content of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whit@@ ish color and oval shape , and they are fitted with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; label .
30 If the laboratory studies are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium poly@@ ph@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken other medicines or recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in equal individual outlets or via an gast@@ ric f@@ ist@@ le ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take out of the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon Gran@@ ules . • Cut off a straight edge , e.g. a measuring spot on the edge of the knife to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • Get the recommended number of spo@@ on@@ ful@@ s Gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat patients with &quot; acute mat@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , lowered blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial infar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( abnormal measuring value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
when angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who submit to a PCI , a higher dose is administered , and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) compared with the conventional combination treatment with hepatitis ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I compared .
during the PCI the patients often used a St@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the an@@ try to prevent sh@@ utter ) , and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ ci@@ o@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
during the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in terms of all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ se , except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more efficient than Hep@@ ar@@ se .
angi@@ ox@@ ical may not be used in patients who possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine , or one of the other ingredients .
it must not be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as in humans with high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee for Human@@ ist Hol@@ ders ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ ar@@ ders during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute mat@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ r@@ int ) ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) is required for emergency access or an early intervention .
the recommended initi@@ ation dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt rating of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in further episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
after the PCI , after clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of impact .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one of this immediately followed by intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a sole Bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt rate of 0.3 mg / kg / kg should be made .
to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully administered prior to application and administered it rapidly intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT exceeds 225 seconds , additional monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , a PCI should be submitted ( whether with bi@@ val@@ r@@ ud@@ in against ACS ) , a lower inc@@ endi@@ ary rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to date and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is again checked .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which led to the approval phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ trial ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included for approval , the ACT is 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment when an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis cases An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see paragraph 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can termin@@ ate 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ question@@ able Hep@@ ar@@ ine or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous offering of low @-@ molecular h@@ ep@@ arin .
- known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active blood pressure or increased blood disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ ac disease . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients depend carefully to monitor symptoms and signs of bleeding in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if this PCI @-@ patient can occur in most of arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation in most cases , in patients receiving a per@@ cut@@ aneous corrosion intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle , bleeding occurs .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International standard debt ratio ) should be prevented , in order to ensure that the value of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in again reached the existing level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( h@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ s@@ wir@@ l ) , it may be assumed that these active ingredients increase blood risk .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in any case regularly .
in terms of effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , failure or post@@ nat@@ al development in@@ adequate ( see Section 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group than in those treated with h@@ ep@@ arin was more common in women and in patients over 65 years more common to un@@ wanted events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined after the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding as defined in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both minor and heavy bleeding occurs significantly less frequently than in the groups of hepatitis B and GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood levels of ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious blood flow levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood flow , surgery due to bleeding , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion .

both minor and heavy bleeding occurs significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ing group under Hep@@ ar@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organ@@ izer in table 6 .
in case of overdose , treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is eng@@ aging with regard to signs of bleeding .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm inj@@ ected or as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for glucose monitoring ( sugar ) in blood or does not process insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in distingu@@ ishes itself very margin@@ ally of human insulin , and the change means it is faster and a shorter period of time has a short @-@ effective human@@ kind .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a leng@@ thy insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in one study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
with type 2 diabetes , in which the insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indication for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % was observed after six months ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % on insulin injec@@ tions .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted , if it is taken together with a number of other medicines that can counter@@ act on the glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions in the area of the abdominal wall , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injec@@ tions through continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin delivery , the insulin need for patients with a limitation of liver function could be dimin@@ ished .
any change of the amount of effect , the mark ( heart st@@ icker ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ able etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin requirements .
3- A in@@ sufficient dosage or termination of a treatment , in particular patients with a insulin requiring diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ r ; these states are potentially life threatening .
feeding a patient on any other insulin type or insulin delivery should be carried out under controversial supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin shots and can therefore change in changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances which can increase the blood sugar level and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ic , phosph@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , sympath@@ ol@@ ym@@ ers such as bed block@@ ers , cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ ine , and reserves can be minim@@ ised or missing the symptoms of ad@@ r@@ ents counter@@ parts .
animal experiments for reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin is over@@ flowing into human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not appear in the breast milk , nor will it res@@ or@@ ates according to oral use .

after a Glu@@ at@@ agon@@ in@@ ject , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypo@@ glyc@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( in particular by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that a sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be carried out faster at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ ges of insulin resistance . the effects of action is shorter than for hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mell@@ itus , insulin post@@ age in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg contains a proportional amount of por@@ tional glu@@ eing effects , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose monitoring effects , as are human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast mode of action such as normal human insulin and reaches the complete glucose tolerance effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data was clearly evident that an application of insulin mac@@ ular gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin requiring 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin had been ge@@ ared in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ den@@ ial control has been given as with a human standard , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given as in human normal insulin which is given 2 billion gro@@ ov@@ ing before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to a normal normal level , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin delivery in gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after onset of the meal in comparison to human north @-@ insulin , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given prior to the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
