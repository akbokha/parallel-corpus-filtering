<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European opening report (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Humanarzedressors (CHMP) has been evaluated as the committee described in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information on your condition or treatment, please read the Packages (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in mouth) as a solution for inclusion (1 mg / ml) and as a injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Cast thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disorder, a psychic condition involving patients with manic episodes (Period abnormal atmosphere) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe Manatic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for fast control of increased agitation or behavioral disorders, if the oral ingestion of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution may take the solution or melt tablets in patients with the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify is needed, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of neurons to another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiaohzole probably works mainly as "partial agro" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiaohzol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in less than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripivovol helps to normalize the activity of brain activity, which will be reduced psychotic or manic symptoms and will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, to prevent the recovery of symptoms, was investigated in three studies by up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of injection solution was compared with schizophrenia or similar diseases in two studies, compared with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared with a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared with twelve weeks of 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been resorted to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was found in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder which compared to tamply agitation, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to take-up (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, Abilify received doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms based agitation than patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented placebo for up to 74 weeks compared to placebo-recurrational episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 10- or 15-mg doses, Abilify-injections were even more effective than placebo which increased symptoms and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, Tremor (tremble), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), obstruction and exhaustion (increased storage production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanist Holders (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in the treatment of schizophrenia, and with the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, mainly manic episodes, and with whom the manic episodes had responded to the treatment with Aripian ol, against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee passed on the result that the advantages of injection solution in rapid control of increased agitation and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder sufferers, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval for the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients that were mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiaohzole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a daily dose of 15 mg / day, daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although single patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, irrespective of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder treatment in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Having regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiation dose should be considered if clinical factors are justify themselves (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the arithmetical dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases according to the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also with treating Aripiaohzol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased suicidal risk with Aripiaohol existed in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripivzole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemia, cardiac insufficiency, hypovolemia, treatment with hematric medicines) or hypertonia (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which one year or less continued, there were occasional reports about the treatment with Aripiaohzol advocate dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of an ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, should be drawn up, reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If one patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear fever, without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, have to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Aripivuzol should be used in patients with seizures in the history of history or conditions, which are used with seizures, with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripivzole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiaohzol, an elevated death of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dose and the response of unwanted cerebrovascular events treated with Aripiaohzol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazian or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients that were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients receiving direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipthey, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally known in schizophrens patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiaohzol on the central nervous system, caution occurs when Aripiañol in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines referred to as Seas (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiaohzol, but this effect is not relevant to clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers an extremely effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism may result the common application of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common use of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should expose the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be carried out similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dose height prior to the starting therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Dilatazem or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be calculated with a moderate increase in the arithmetical concentration.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripivzole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodxymorphine-Ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazor) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should come to notify her doctor if she will be pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiaohzole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data security for the human being and due to the concerns affected by the animal rights in pregnancy, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against, hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiaohzol has no influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequencies of the below side effects are defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiaohzol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystirony and Dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with semi-idol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study for over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was performed in patients with Aripiaol treatment and 13.1% in patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiaohzol and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was diagnosed in patients with Aripiaemia treatment and 53,3% in patients with Lyme disease treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was found in patients with Aripiaol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients with placebo-treated treatment and 15.7% for placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripivzol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, found no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiaohzol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic medication, malignant neuroleptric syndrome, late dyskineness and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute claims with Aripivovol alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis treatment in treating a transition with Aripiaohzol; however, it is unlikely that Hempiaohzol has a high plasmaple binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It assumes that the effectiveness of Aripivpractice in schizophrenia and bipolar-I-disorder on the combination of a partial agonist effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptor and antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors are communicated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiaohzole showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an effective affinity for the Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HTDC, for alpha-1 adrusers and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiaohzol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg. a day over 2 weeks, the Positons Emissions Emission-Tomography showed a dose-dependant reduction in the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands and nucleus caudatus and by the turkey.</seg>

<seg id="78">In a week 52 the proportion of patients enrolled in a half-day trial which included a response to study medication, in both groups (Aripiaohzol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured values defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than on haloperiac.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in declining rate, which was 34% in the Aripiaohzol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind trial involved in schizophrenia of 26 weeks, the 314 patients enrolled in significantly fewer patients with a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Ariiberzole showed a placebo over three weeks of placebo over three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapists over 3 weeks with fixed dose for patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Ariiberzole showed no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two cases of placebo and active-controlled monotherapists for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Ariiberzole showed a compared to placebo in week 3 and an assessment effect compared to lithium or semi-visual idol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Ariiberzole also showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania to like lithium or semi-idol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder with a mixed or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiaenol yielded an superior efficacy in reducing economic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study for over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripivovol, compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, predominantly in the prevention of a bipolar decline.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes responsible for dehydration and hydroxycycline used by CYP3A4 is catalysed through CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination life is approximately 75 hours for Aripiaohzol for an extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours with 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripivzol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and similarly, in a pharmacokinetic investigation, patients showed no gender-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the impact of space on the pharmacokinetics of Aripivuzole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiaohzole and Dehydro-Aripiaol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with differences of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiaohzol and Dehydro-Aripiaol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw shots on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity at repetitive gift, reproductive sticity, genotoxicity and the canogenic potential, there are no specific dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposure that exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people, so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects encapsulated a dosing method of toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at a recommended maximum dose of 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the medium steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of people).</seg>

<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and there was no colausal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli ingredient, which promotes the coagulation of microtubuli from tubes and stabilizes the microtubuli.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network that is vital for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin cells were mediated in the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies that the presence of albumin promotes the presence of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transidotheliale transport through the gp-60 albumreviewer is conveyed and caused by the albuminant protein SPARC (refted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the field of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for meric mamcarcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two-tone unversioned studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomized phase III comparative study.</seg>

<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-gift higher (43%) as after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature over in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue paper it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily associated with 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3 -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the average total dose is 4% of the given total dose of less than 1% of the total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal cleance.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that seams are similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and also contains the same substance (also called "reference selective)."</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood flow values, in which, in connection with a blood transfusion complications may occur, if a blood-blood flow is not possible and in which a loss of blood of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seams must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make a self-hake, Abseamed is to be injected in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be done by the patient or the support staff, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobster should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deciles per adult or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl on children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients are to control, to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron ore drugs should be given throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who received chemotherapy, or in patients suffering from kidney problems, anaemia may cause anemia caused by a erythropoietinmangel or thereby that the body is not sufficient on the body's own erythropoietine.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene (DNA) which enabled them to the formation of epoxetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with an injection in a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients receiving anaemia problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All of the participating patients were injected for at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a Vene was injected before they were either placed on parseamed or continue to get Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indication for the efficacy was the change of hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also submitted the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin speckled seams with those of Eprex / Erypo studied at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemogitation values of patients that were submitted to Abseamed as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In contrast, the patients who continue to get Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise of blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) like sudden, stressful migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who possibly insensitive (allergic) against epoxetin alfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as a injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, as additional studies are necessary to make sure that no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Humanist Holders (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the regulations adopted by the European Union of evidence, the medicine has a comparable quality, security and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the Abseamed company, will provide information on medical specialists in all Member States, including information about the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pädiatric patients with which the hemoglobconformity should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6,8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anew symptoms and symptoms may be different depending on age, gender, and total disease of disease; hence the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease insurrection is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobins by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to variability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient with individual hemoglobin values or under the hemogglobin- target concentation.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoggloomy variability, more than a dose of dose is attempted to reach the hemoglobin target of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value exceeds more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored continuously to ensure that epetin alfa should be used in the lowest authorised dose which is needed to control anaemia and anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need more power outlets as patients in which the initial anemia should be less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need more power outlets as patients in which the initial anaemia should be less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="397">Patients should be monitored continuously to ensure that epetin alfa should be used in the lowest authorised dose which is needed for control of anesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte increase by more than 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, should maintain the dose of 150 kg / kg three times per week or 450 kg / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobster increase is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reproduction of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 kg / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 kg / kg three times per week the hemogbell value is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocytic number increased to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, should maintain the dose of 300 kg / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">However, the hemogbell value is &lt; 1 g / l (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocytes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), with which the prepent inlay of ≥ 4 blood-conservative should be required, abseamed at a dose of 600 kg / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operating procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The Iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donor program - they will be made available to large iron reserves before the beginning of the Abseeded therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 kg / kg of epoxetin alfa, which should be given a weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgery and the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>

<seg id="409">In patients who are provided for a larger elective orthopaedic operation, the application of epetin alfa occurs during the following pre-, supportive arterial hypertension, vascular disease of the body or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently beaten heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastipie (PRCA) Very rare was reported via the occurrence of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden retirement, reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month), with increased demand for transfusions, should be the Retikulocyte value and the usual causes for a failure (iron, folates or vitamin B12 deficiency, infections or infections, loss of blood, and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte is normal, taking into consideration the anemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "Index), which is detected (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliters, or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythrophobic antibodies were determined and an investigation from the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of seams in patients with risk-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 Patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not be exceeded the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentation under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk for severe cardiovasculature events were observed if erythropoese stimulating active ingredients (ESA) were given to a hemogglobin- target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is attributable to the gift of epoxetine if the hemoggloomy concentration is increased over the concentration of anaemia symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobster increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase of hypertension.</seg>

<seg id="420">In case of tumour patient suffering from epetin alfa, a 2-3-week delay between epetine-alfa gift and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients that possibly must be transfixed).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must minimize the risk for possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 of the patients with chemotherapyeremia - Dosiscustomization with the aim to keep the hemogbell value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in relation to the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients receiving an ardean orthopaedic procedure, if possible, before the onset of epoxetine-alfa medication, the cause of anaemia should be investigated and accordingly treated.</seg>

<seg id="645">One-off and multiples of 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that seem to be dosing.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma seal increased rapidly from &lt; 10% to the maximum value to 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase vanishes from the large circulation of half times t ½ -0,24 and t ½ h 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Elimination time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above 1 ½ levels) are probably representing the quick absorption in the bones and the excretions over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the valid dose is found in the urine, while the remainder is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of Zoledronic acid concentration, by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration on time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance by using cytochrome P450-enzyme metabolic syndrome is unlikely, because Zoledronic acid is not metabolic in humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine Clearance, and at the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in fact that a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal disruption to up to 35 ml / min do not require dose adjustment of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there are no problem for heavy renal problems (creatinational Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), this population is not possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, administered over a 15-minute period, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application has been determined by dosages of Zoledronic acid in rats, equivalent to a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose representing the 7fold of the humane therapeutic exposure that corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to the AUC, corresponds to), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application with accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intentional human exposure, the toxicological effects were caused by other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common method in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysivity of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, which reflects the pharmacological, antiresortive effect of the substance.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public The present document is a summary of the European public consultation report (EPAR), explained in which the Committee for Humanarzedressors (CHMP) has been evaluated as the committee described in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy medicine) in patients (particularly important patients) in which metformin (diabetic medicine) is not used.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (particularly important patients), it can not be taken satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl alcohol or insulin, the previous dose of the sulphide-substance or insulin can be preserved, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonyl harnics should be reduced or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be processed better and decreases blood sugar levels, so that type 2 diabetes can be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acetone was studied in tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl harness, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, concentration of a substance in the blood (glycemylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered with the use of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of acetylene in the treatment of metastasis and a sulfonyl harnist in a decrease in HbA1c values increase by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of acetone and insulin had been studied in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin, compared with 0.14% compared to 6 months, compared with 0,14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disorders, infections of the upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who possibly react sensitively to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic ketoazir (high kidney levels - acidylation level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Accounting is to serve as an alternative to the patient's standard treatment as an alternative to the patient's standard treatment with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the TakeEurope R & D Centre as a approval for the marketing of Actos in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and wear on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inadequate in those due to contraindications or incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are threatened by the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. past, heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increases the dose continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema, when Pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">An cardiovasculature outlet study with Pioglitazone in patients aged 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and existing pharmacasculous disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver frequency values (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors can be increased to 3 times the maximum limit of the standard, the liver frequency values are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">In case a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, waiter problems, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark resin, are to check the liver values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be conducted until the presence of the laboratory parameters in the clinical assessment should be conducted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, dosing-dependent weight gain was detected, which can be ignant and attached in some cases linked to fluid operation.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemogelution in combination with Pioglitazon, a slight decrease in the middle hemoglobal values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in patients with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobins by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, in patients that pioglitazon exists as oral or triple-combination therapy with a sulphate harness or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch it was reported under the treatment of thiazodinitis, including Pioglitazon, on a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, however, the possibility of a macular edema should be aware of the possibility of disturbances; a suitable ophthalmological assignment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages that were randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated error response was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wants to pursue a pregnancy or a patient, the treatment is to impose (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for investigations of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines prescribed by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with a fibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazon around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in lowering the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazon, in pregnancy, hypertension and increased insulin resistance to the parent is reduced and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the dry growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequent &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and refractory tracking of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents occurred over the three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under Placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups using metformin or sulphuene harness.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing advanced macular condition, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported via heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, more frequently if Pioglitazone was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of messages were randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative drugs.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the scope of the ongoing trial period of 3.5 years, questionnaires at 44 / 870 (5.1%) were treated with Pioglitazon patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) patients who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">Taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to effect on a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-g (PPAR-γ), which leads to the animal model to an increased insensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucost in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Glicenzid as Monotherapy has been conducted over two years to assess time to subsequent therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment of therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of treated patients (over 50% of patients under Glicencidal).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was assigned to insufficient optimisation with insulin delivery, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients that continue to be insulin; a reduced insulin delivery in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, below Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinine Quotiator showed a statistically significant decrease in the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was checked in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo one reduction in the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL Cholesterinspiegel and lower level, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglyceride in comparison to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid, and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazon, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, whereas under metformin and Gliclazid decreased values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved triglyceride level, which is also increased by a effect on the triglyceride absorption, as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROactive study, a cardiovasculature outlet study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing, advanced pharmacological disease were randomly allocated to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy to either pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After an oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the top concentration of the variable pioglitazone in plasma was usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone could no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral usage of radioactive marker Pioglitazone, the marker was found mainly in the fur (55%) and a lesser extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination season of unchangeable pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and all active metabolism is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function, but the rates of oral Clearance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and apes agreed in after repeated plasma volume magnification with hemlution, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac trophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to that, in treating Pioglitazon, reduced hyperspemia and increased insulin resistance to the parent and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the dry growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the uretic epithelium is induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familiar Polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazodinitis led to a increased frequency of colontumbles.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated error response was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, each with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid, were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinine Quotives were observed in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglyceride level, but also improved the postoperative level triglyceride level, resulting in an effect on the tryglyceride absorption, as well as the hepatic trygliceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the objective of their primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-killing myocardial infarction, stroke and acute coronarisation syndrome, impact amputation above the knuckle, coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularization of leg arteries, suggest that with the taking of Pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk are linked.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of messages that were randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon, showed an increased incidence of bone breaks in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 questionnaires per 100 patient years), compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study of more than 20 weeks Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved triglyceride level, this has a effect on the triglyceride level, as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not take up after the first food intake of the day, at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already being used separately from each other in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also led a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to investigate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase of vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors had been treated with ADROVANCE, low (11%) compared to those that were only alendronat income (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data on the basis that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the movement apparatus (muscles, bones, joints) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus (diarrhea), constipation, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), ulcers (ulcera), ulcers (ulcera), scanned Abdomes (blinded stomach) as well as acidic reins.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the tactical exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplances or increased incidence of side effects, including subcontractual or overimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; the provisions of the formulation or regime should be performed only under tight control of one in the transplantation medical physician (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of this transition to alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosiscustomizations must be performed to ensure that the systematic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Advantum is a medicine with a low Clearance, customizations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials prove that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels of talons do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the rear-view mirror of Tacrolimus lies in the first time following liver transplantations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and sneeding - and heart-transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplants were generally used as a rule of blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including transplanting, or other side effects, which can occur in a sequel by tacrolimus substitution or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; the provisions of the formulation or regime should be performed only under tight control of one in the transplantation medical physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of transplants from adult heart transplants and transplants in childhood are still no clinical data for retardant formulation from the agraphs.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions which can result in lowering the tacrolimb level in the blood and a reduction in the clinical efficacy of tacrolimus, the consumption of vegetable compounds (Hypericum perforatum) can be avoided, or other plant medicines during a treatment with Advantages (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood, as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of herbal medicinal products or plant medicines, which are known as Hemmer or Inductors of CYP3A4, can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus, thus reducing blood levels of tacrolimus or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended that the tacrolimus- blood levels can change with the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintaining the same concentration (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics study showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by inhibiting of gastrointestinal pollution.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly regarded prednisolone or methylprednisolon, as it is used in acute waste reactions, can increase the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood or lower.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus affects the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines prescribed by CYP3A4, whose metabolism is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because Tacrolimus would reduce the steroid of steroid contraceptive and thereby raise the hormone exposition, is particularly careful with decisions on receptive action.</seg>

<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method that is referred to as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene (DNA) which enabled them to the formation of the human body factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is produced differently, so the drug contains no protein of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of medication used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of advances in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of the new blood-septic tank were awarded "excellent" or "well" evaluated.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first permitted data, the CHMP has continued the benefit of the benefits of the benefit of the benefits, but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has required a solution of PSURs at the base of the security profile of ADVATE, which is required to apply for authorisation in 5 years to apply for the approval process in another 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited divided the Committee for Humanitarian Affairs (CHMP) that the company returns its application for approval from Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the soft parts (tissues, the other structures in the body, surrounds and leans feet).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," that has been changed so that there are no copies of themselves, and therefore no infection can trigger in people.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advanin would have been injected directly into the tumors and allow cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from which is not defective in the human body existing p53-gene, is normally bearing to restoration damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can't be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When Li-Fraumeni cancer is defective in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not properly, and the cancer cells can grow further and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient before Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undermining, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP has examined the answers to those questions asked, there were still some issues unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the evaluation of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP has generated a list of questions related to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion has not been proved that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors will take advantage of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration, and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven enough for advancing in a reliable way, and that it is neither responsible for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The CHMP did not know it whether the consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed hormone release" means that the tablets are so summoned, that one of the most effective elements are released immediately and the other is released for several hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by a allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal smual sulfur (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years from age 12, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily such a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medication can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The major effect dimensions were the changes in the severity of the hypocrisy symptoms that were reported in the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, the patients carried their symptoms all 12 hours in a journal, and evaluate the symptoms in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hypocrisy symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported cases, the aeronauts income, above a decrease in symptoms by 46,0%, compared with 35.9% compared to patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was viewed, the patient showed a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), tyngitis, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipitis (lack of appetite), constipitis (sleeplessness), somnolency (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeropaze may not be used with patients who may possibly be ensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine, or one of the other components, against adrinsist active ingredients or Loratadine (a different medicinal medicines for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from hypertonic glaucoma (increased eye pressure), cardiac disease (hypertension), hyperthygiosis (excuse of thyroid) or have already had a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral hemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for marketing of aeronauts throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without having to break, break or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the absence of data on inconvenience and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as during long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can take away.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After declining the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Da Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoid oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine, pergolid, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetacolin, Napholin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aeropaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver problems and the data is not sufficient to pronounce relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment in treating hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Treatment in treating the following patient groups is required: • Patients in digital life • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hymyocardial infarction in the anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder transplant or bronchospita in the history of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before implementation of matological tests as antihistamine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reaction and can reduce in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In case of the results of the psychomotor tests, no significant differences between the patients with Desloratadine and the placebo treated patients were detected, regardless of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine is not identified, so that interaction with other drugs can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vitro CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate nor inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconvenience of application of aeropaze during pregnancy is not secured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies however does not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans, and due to vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrin, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should, however, be clarified in this rare cases that it may occur in very rare cases to a fullest type of transport or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular disease) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions).</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, complicity pollution, muscle weakness, arousal heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, stimulation, nausea, vomiting, splendid pain, dizziness, Tinnitus, axilies, blurred vision and hypertonia or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly probable with children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouthunder, pupillary arre and - dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human masturcells / basophile as well as the inhibition of expression of the adhesion P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study involving adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement capacities of the flux, including amplifying subjective determination or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily no higher frequency of drowsiness was detected in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause more personomimetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets were received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-agonist efficacy of aerinaze tablets, determines the basis of the total cores for the symptom (except for nasal smucosine sulfur), significantly higher than in monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in terms of degradation effect, determined by the nasal mucosmess, was significantly higher than in monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week period of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for Pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze during healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrin was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosing study, which was carried out with the formulation of healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects desloratadine was badly missive.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine according to the sole gift of pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was the exposition of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies of security vulnerology, for toxicity at repetitive gift, for genotoxicity and the reproductive-toxicity, the pre-clinical data with desloratadine makes no specific dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity as their individual components, and the effects observed in general in connection with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-oxicological studies, the combination of Loratadine / Pseudoephedrine in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day are not teratogenic.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 for the application application, Pharmacy's application system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamine contribute to the relieving of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body-specific substance, which can produce its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was investigated in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies on patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of addings, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were presented to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup, the solution to remove and the tablets in the same way as the tablets and application for children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius to a mean decrease of symptoms (symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to decrease from 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urtikaria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be used in patients who possibly insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadine, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe approval for the marketing of Aerius within the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for the use of desloratadine in teenagers from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be effected in accordance with the previous symptoms of disease and can be resumed after the sound of symptoms and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergies time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were found in the context of clinical studies involving desloratadine tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study the effectiveness of alcoholus and alcohol was not reinforced by alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should, however, be clarified in this rare cases that it may occur in very rare cases, which can result in impairment of transport or the ability to control machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported on the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently observed side effects, which was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%), thatopenness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side effect was headaches, with 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadine, and with 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadine (ninety clinical dose), no clinical effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human masturcells / basophile as well as the inhibition of expression of the adhesion P-seless on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in the desloratadine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for more than 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In an individual dosing study, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement capacities of the flux, including amplifying subjective determination or the tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in treating the symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrive and redness of the eyes and itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As seen from the total cores of the questionnaire to the quality of life in rhino-conjuni, Aerius effectively reduces the severe allergic rhinitis in octopical rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria has been demonstrating for further forms of the Urselaria, as the underlying pathophysiology impercepts the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of etching with different forms, and chronic patients can be made easier to recruit.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine-release is a vital factor in all primeval diseases, it is expected that Desloratadine leads to an improvement in the chronic idiopathic urticaria in other forms of contikaria. this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidance.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the lowering of size and number of paddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of the patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itchy of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadine, compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and eness significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale on evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis -population, a higher concentration of Desloratadin was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no basis points for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not been identified, however, that interactions with other drugs are not excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibits and neither a substrate nor inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In an individual dosing study with desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetthalates, low-calorie breakfast) do not affect the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies showed with Desloratadine and Loratadine, in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to toxicity fils by Desloratadine and from Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies for security vulnerology, toxicity at repetitive gift, genotoxicity and the reproductive-toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadadin let no specific dangers for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose-monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macromedia 400, indigocarmin. (E 132)), colorless film (contains Hypromflawless, Macromedia 400), Carnauba wax, slight wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken irrespective of meals, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The indescribable doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are prevalent which support treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children aged 2 to 11, metabolic desloratadine is restricted and experienced a higher substamping load (see paragraph 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11, restricts to metabolic syndrome, is identical to children who are regularly to metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactless absorption or a sucroase-isomaltase- insufficiency of this medication should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study the effectiveness of alcohol is not amplified when taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">Overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group, like in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius when patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, where up to 45 mg of desloratadine (ninety clinical dose) were given, no clinical effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11, who came into question for antihistamine treatment, received daily Desloratal dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the development of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadine is similar in adults and children, the inability data of Desloratadin may be extrapolated in adults in adults.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older men for protecting flu that is caused by the influenza A virus (type) H5N1 influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which may cause a strain of influenza that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out if a new strain of influenza virus is affected, which can be easily spreading from human beings because human beings do not have any immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus as "body-foreign" and antibodies to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a position to form a contact with a influenza virus this family fast antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the surface of membranes that detects the human body as a body-foreign), cleaned up, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites revealed that the study was not performed in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>

<seg id="1912">This was compared with low dosided Ritonbavir increased medicinal medicines for 206 adults, which had been taken before protease inhibitors, compared with other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indication for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken inhibitor inhibitor, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than in placebo, but atype was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera also reduced the viral load, but had been treated by the children who had previously treated with protease inhibitors, only very few on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated earlier with protease inhibitors, the viral load of the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment was equally effective as other protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitor, it came under Ageneric ase to a more powerful trash of the viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Ageneric ase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (diarrhea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>

<seg id="1924">Ageneric ase was originally approved in "outstanding circumstances," because of approval for scientific reasons, only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a approval for placing on the market in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Ageneric ase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitor (PI) pretreated adults and children 4 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Typically, Ageneric capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic Boobs of Ambavir together with low doses of Ritoncar (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ambbavir should be taken into account taking into consideration the individual viral resistance sample and the patient's pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of blown avir as a solution to take-out is 14% less than of blown avir as capsule; therefore Ageneric tablets and solution for inserting to a milligram per milligram base is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for acupuncture capsules is 600 mg of blown cavir twice daily with 100 mg of Ritoncar twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if aGenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of pavionic avir (Boobs), higher doses must be applied to Ageneric ase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for acupuncture capsules is 20 mg of blown cavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ambital, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of assease in combination with low doses of Ritoncar or other proteasants were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Ageneric ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data on inconvenience and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, adult dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous application should be done in patients with mild or moderate liver problems with caution, in patients with severe liver problems it contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Ageneric ase cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that possess a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of blown avir during taking ambbins (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy do not lead to the healing of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or any other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with acupunase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Ageneric capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritoncar and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of liver failure with potential fatal approaches.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of a simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the content of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing heptive liver function, including a chronic active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Ageneric ase and Ritonavir with Fluticason or other glucose levels which are handled over CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the possible benefit of a treatment reduces the risk of systemic cohesitation effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the subsidy function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the substitution of the HMG-Coa-reducer inhibitor and Simvastatin highly dependent of CYP3A4 is not recommended to consignment agenera with Lovastatin and Simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolytics.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4. for some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, phenytoin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standard debt ratio), are methods to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective for reduced plasma concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with ambbavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraction can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored at oppiatric symptoms, especially if there are even low doses of Ritoncar.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of a toxicity, due to the high propylene glycol solution, this formulation is contraindicated with children under a age of four years and should be used with caution in certain patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asurase should be placed on duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy, it was reported about the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an existing type of diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases which were prescribed medication related to the development of a diabetes mellitus, or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug addictive factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders, associated with metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There were reports of hemophilen patients (type A and B) which were treated with protease inhibitors, reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematoms and hamarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunity defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial ethtology is adopted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoekrosis reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates.</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic latitude, must not be associated with pharmaceuticals, whose active ingredients are used mainly through CYP2D6, and associated with increased plasma seal with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin has caused a 82% reduction of the AUC of Ambavir, which can lead to a virological failure and to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the lowest plasma seal through a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritoncar, much unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with currant (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient adopts St Johanniskraut, the Amprenavirus levels are and, if possible to check the virusload and turn the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfinavir is administered along with Ambavir (see also Erika irenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increase, for Cmax, to increase 30% if Ritoncar (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amblown capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of blown avir performed twice daily and Ritoncar 100 mg twice daily, which prove the effectiveness and inconvenience of this treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritoncar twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of blown avir in plasma, which were achieved in the combination of ambbavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritoncar twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ambbavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritoncar twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambavir and Kaletra can not be given, but it is recommended by engaging monitoring, as the effectiveness and inconvenience of this combination cannot be known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didanic in combination with didanosin, but is recommended that the income from Didanosin and Agenerase is at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, for the gift of Erecirenz in combination with ambbavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritoncar (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Erecirenz in combination with ambbavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protease inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protease inhibitor and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin bends the serum concentration of blown car.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this medication should be used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring needs to be performed as an exact forecast of the effect of ambbavir and Ritoncar is difficult for Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Ambavir and Rifabutin led to a rise in plasma concentration (AUC) by Interfabutin around 193%, with a rise in relation to the adverse reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1978">For clinical reasons, if it is necessary for clinical reasons, to date Rifabutin along with Ageneric ase, at least half of the recommended dose is caught at least half of the recommended dose, even though there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asterase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma level of both medicines will be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of 700 mg of ketoconazole twice a day with 200 mg of ketoconazole in plasma was reduced by 25% and the AUC (0-0) to 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without the simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritoncar.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be used together with Ageneric ase, possibly interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be closely related to toxic reactions that are connected to these drugs, if they are used in combination with acupunase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitor, it is advisable that antazida can not be taken at the same time as appoints, as it may occur to resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Concurrent use of anticonvulva, known as an encycloductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with ambbbital can lead to an degradation of the plasma level of blown avir.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Simultaneous taking with acupuncture can increase their plasma concentration and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in the connection side effects including hypotoxin, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study included in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg of fluoasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) for 7 days, the fluoroconpropionate plasma concentration increased by approximately 86% (90% conversion interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenera with Ritoncar is not recommended with these glucose levels, unless the potential benefit of a treatment to the risk of systemic costeroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-Coa-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose substitution is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases of plasma seal with simultaneous administration of Ageneric ase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plaid increases of this HMG-Coa-reductase inhibitors to myeopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these medicines with ambbins are not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is a common monitoring of therapeutic concentration up to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasma concentration of Cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased in simultaneous gift of ambbbr (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asurase must not be used along with oral submissive Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while using parenteral midazolam caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of periodical mitdazolam with other protease inhibitors may indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored at oppiatric symptoms, especially if there are even low doses of Ritoncar.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the less reliability of historical displacement, currently no recommendation can be given, as the Amprenavir dose is given at the same time, when Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants with appoints, a reinforced control of the INR (International standard debt ratio) is recommended for the possibility of weakening or amplification of the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritoncar on hormonal contraction is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods are recommended for contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous gift of Ageneric ase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medication may be used during pregnancy only after careful recovery of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk activated rats, ambbbr-related substances have been detected, however, it is not known whether Ambbbr helps people in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of dreadful rats, given by the innization in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding of Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the breastfeeding.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and extension of APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritoncar twice daily: n = 107) patients were treated with patients with virological failure more than 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypical genetic testing systems based on genotypical interpretations systems can be used to estimate the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with inhibitor inhibitor resistant to isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The present (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50F, M36I, I54A / C / F / W, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir as well as a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always attract current interpretations systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on photypic resistance testing based analysis, clinical validated phenotypic interpretations systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data on the estimation of the activity of Ambavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with inhibitor inhibitor resistant to isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic tests, have developed clinically-phenotypical Cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four associated with a reduced sensitivity to Ambavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain crucifixion against Ritoncar, the sensitivity against Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between Ambavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fossilhour resistors, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral diseases, including an incidence of Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 Isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 Isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritoncar (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Ambavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; receiving this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations into limits that can impose the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of acupunase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017 mg twice daily) with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily with lowest armoured riot "geboostert."</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threesand sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneric ase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the subcategory A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis proved the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in terms of time adjusted averaging the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, in a non-target wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the effectiveness of non-polled assease is based on two controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenera solution was taken twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was not given to low dosibly knuckles at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients had enrolled plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre-treated benefits of "unsafooed" agenerase. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (max) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax, reduced by 30% when Ritoncar (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Ambavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of blown avir 12 hours to dose (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the Steady-State (cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the concurrent consumption affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of ambbins from the blood stream in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change causes a decrease in the total concentration of the effectiveness in plasma, with the quantity of unconnected Ambbavir, which remains the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unconnected Amprenavir remained constant, the percentage of the free active ingredient during the dosing intervals in the Steady-State is over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">For this reason you have to induce or inhibited the CYP3A4 or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution when they are simultaneously administered with Ageneric (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Ageneric tablets, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily ambital exposure such as adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made up of the solution 14% less bioavailability than from the capsules; therefore Ageneric solution and atase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammar basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal impairment should be low to elimination of Ambavir and Ritoncar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment steps lead to Ambavir plasma screens, comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Ambavir twice daily with no simultaneous administration of Ritoncar twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity with blown avir in mice and rats competes in male animals benigne hepatocellular adenoma in dosages caused by the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat), after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of blown cavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21-based mechanism for the emergence of hepatocyellular adenoms and Karzinome was not yet clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on people, both in clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, showed little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests, microidal test of rats and chromosome test at human peripheral lymphocytes was included, Ambbr was neither mutations nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST, ALT, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, in clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed, neither during the administration of Ageneric ase nor after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in young, treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality rate, both at the controls and with ambblown animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">At a systemic plasma position, significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure under therapeutic doses of humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus sound and minor skeleton changes were observed, pointing to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24. if Awesase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of pavionic avir (Boobs), higher doses must be applied to Ageneric ase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for acupuncture capsules is 20 mg of blown cavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ambital, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be done in patients with weak or light liver problems with caution, in patients with severe liver problems it contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses of dosages (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systematic recording of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drugs concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face on the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bag) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-time period according to the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod has been low in patients at the age of 6-12 years and comparable to patients with healthy adults and adults with acute keratosis or super-cell carcinoma.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness were measured (by its effect regarding the reduction of Gag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyms lowered the concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the fusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who possibly are highly sensitive to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update all new information every year, which may be known, examining and updating this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is received to observe the Aldurazyme who observe reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a approval for the marketing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of humanoid α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated on the long-term cytopical therapy in patients with sighted diagnosis of a Mugenysaccharide I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a physician, experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be enhanced when the patient is able to increase all 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as each in relation to the side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be monitored, and infusion of Aldurazyme should be made available only in an appropriate clinical setting, where medical emergencies are available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, we expect almost all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months of treatment beginning.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyms (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interruption, risks must be pre-treated due to the theoretical risk reaction after a termination of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antithesis) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of light or medium-severe infusion, the treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be applied and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half the infusion rate, in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, serious infusion reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms were reduced, a treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be absorbed again with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen / or Corticosteroids) and a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, where the past reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular absorption of laronidase consists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments does not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exponated against Laronidase above the breast milk, is recommended to not feeding during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were identified mainly as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 (treatment duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the phase-3 study and their prolongation of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years are very frequent (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in the history of history, there were heavy reactions, including bronchospasmus, respiratory failure and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions related to Aldurazyme, which were reported in the table with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients and a duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after onset of treatment to a Serokonversion, with the patients at the age of 5, with a heavier comparison form occurred (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) in 13 / 45 patients were not detected by Radioimmunoplances (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, among them 3 patients, with whom it has never occurred to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low-body levels have a robust reduction in the mirror mirror in Harn, whereas patients with high antibody titres were a variable reduction of gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralised effects on the enzymatic Laronid- activity in vitro, which seemed to negatively affected the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug interactions, even if the occurrence of adverse medicine reactions typically occurred with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for enmerisation therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of accumulated substrates and preventing a further accumulation of adequate power inductance.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells of cells into the lynosomes most likely over Manni-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which had referred to the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the middle phenotype and one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forcapped expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label renewal study, where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme compared to the placebo group improving lung function and the ability to appear in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In an open renewal study, improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks showed in the Aldurazyme / Althirazyme group, and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Althirazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant over this period of clinically and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further to the body-size growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with one hepatitis alie (85%) achieved a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear trash of the gag mirror in the Harn (µg / mg of the Kreatinin) was established, which remained constant at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients that has been taken into account by using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes has been summarized for five efficacy variable (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was examined at 20 patients, who had been under the age of 5 (16 patients with the heavy-run form and 4 with the medium-run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four cases, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for increased GAG- mirror in Harn in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was found according to the Z-Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle ening form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe deformation, only limited or even no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study investigations into the codynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schematics were performed on the gag mirror in Harn, the liver and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">With 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks, patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions can represent a acceptable alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemata is equivalent to equal value.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will provide any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applied to ALIMTA as a mono- or in combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 blood.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients are non-hematological toxicity of equal to 3 (except neurotoxicity), therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted by the patient to obtain the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dosages, a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 occurs or so- at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non-sufficient data for inconvenience and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, patients with a placebo-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min do not need to be dose-customizations required for all patients recommended dose customizations.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinine Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; to 1.5 times the upper bilirubin- limit and / or transaminase values (in case of liver metastasis) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit (in presence of liver metastasis) are not investigated especially in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must not be monitored in relation to the bone of the bone and Pemetremixed can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutralistic number reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombo- cytes decreased a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose of dose for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutral number of neutrality, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity as it was observed in the previous treatment cycles - see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and anti-inflammatory toxicity like neutropenia, febrile Neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was beato-, when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients must be instructed with Pemetremixed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophetic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fetched fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the baseline value (at the time of the Randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of participants lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed for 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemical therapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like Cisplatin), and in chemical therapies (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended, since the effects in this age group does not provide enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance is the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are severe and severe triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy alone, 59% of those patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours following chemotherapy alone (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy alone, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy alone (153 from 189), compared with 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolassetron, these figures were 63% for Aloxi (119 out of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a approval for the placing of Aloxi in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexes: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer illnesses and vomiting in excess emetogenic chemotherapy based on cancer illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a severe emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can extend the colon age, patients should be monitored with an amnesty Obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 receptor antagonists, caution is required for simultaneous use of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval, or in patients with whom the QT- interval is extended or tend to be an extended extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with a further chemotherapeutics gift, Aloxi is said to be used neither to treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five examined chemotherapists (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarrubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">Clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-static concentration of the CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one population based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2D6 Inhibitors (DDD6-Inhibitors, Cimetidine, Cimetidine, Cimetidine, Doxetubicin, Fluoxetine, oxidant, Sertraline and Terbinafin) did not have any significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies lie not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the treatment doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most commonly observed in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe side effects (a total of 633 patients), who at least possibly stood in connection with Aloxi (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of transitivity reactions and reactions to the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dose, similar incidence of adverse events such as in other dosing groups; there were no dose-response relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis probably is probably no effective therapy for a Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind trials, 1,132 mg / m2 of cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-value-time 4 hours) or 100 mg of dacetron received (half-value of 7.3 hours), which was administered intravenously at day 1 without Dexamethasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine 1000 or 750 mcg of Cyonosetron received patients compared to the 32 mg ondansetron received at day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the trials involving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study were summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indications chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the appropriate effects of Ondansetron and Dolassetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings in clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the patient's ventricular channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out with 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EKG effects of i.v. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration, an initial decrease in plasma concentration will follow an slow elimination of elimination of the body with an average end time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally used in the whole dose of 0.3- 90 m g / kg for healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the median average (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma stress concentrations at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations come out that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in three consecutive days reached total position (AUC0- ∞), which was comparable to one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the one-time limit of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated in the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect of the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro-vitro studies for metabolites have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 has been involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose found within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as unaltered ingredient that made some 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous bolt-projection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal cleance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver problems, the terminale elimination season and the average system exposure with Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate above the maximum humanist exposure that indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10. from preclinical studies, however, that Palonosetron can be blocked only in very high concentrations of ionic channels that can be involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure of man) that were given every day over two years, resulted in increased incidence of liver tumor, endocrine neoplasmen (thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adnon WB) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is given for unique application, the relevance of these results will be diminished for people.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human Immunity (CHMP) adopted a negative appraisal, in which the approval of the treatment for the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C (Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution).</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was supposed to be similar to a biological drug called Roferone-A with the same medication-effective component that is already approved in the EU (also called reference selective).</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon was to be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (one of the virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue demonstrates damage, moreover, the values of the liver cycle Alanin Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was initiated, which stimulates this to the formation of active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition, and purity of the drug, mode of mode, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with Hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference age by 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, the drug was measured after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Further concerns were expressed, that the data on stability of the drug and the drug was not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with Hepatitis C related to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferone-A was similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon the disease was retardant in more patients than with reference feedance; also Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test was used in the study to investigate the question, where the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a crate formation of incoming skin infection) and small infected infirmities (Riss- or snorkelet), abdices and wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for treating infections that have been demonstrably or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo is not effective against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months but patients under the age of 18 must not be more than 2% of body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should further examine the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosomes (parts of the bacterienzelle where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indication of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was disbanded after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients suffering from placebo were treated to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with Hautwunden, about 90% of patients were applied for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that altarry was diagnosed with the treatment of abscesses (cavities in body tissues) or of infections that have been demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanist Holders (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo on the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections are against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small Lazerations, dices or wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for placing alloco in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, which shows no improvement within two to three days, are to be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitisation or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment shall be aborted to the treatment carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infection in which MRSA is known as Erreger (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary infected wounds, the effectiveness of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment, no improvement or worsening occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to low plasma concentration, which were achieved in humans according to topical use on isolated skin or infected surface, a clinically relevant inhibition is not expected in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 The average reapamulin ACC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application increased from 2 times daily, and Cmax after topical application of 1% retinamulin Salbe increased to a reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low system exposure according to topical application in patients, dose customizations are not required if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction xicity of oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinamulin at the gift of a systemic antibiotic regiment is.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continued to be finished, is between the benefit of the breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy to women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies on 2150 patients suffering from superficial skin infections, the Altargo had applied, the most commonly reported adverse event of irritation at the administration site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode of retinamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pandromutilin, a substance that is separated from fermentation of Cliticus (former Pleurotus passaganus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction in a specific binding of the 50s subsidy of the bacterial ribosomes which differ from the bonds of other ribosal antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding of ribosomal protein L3 is involved in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the Peptidyltransferase.com region.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this binocular tumor, Pandromutiline block the peptidyltransfer, blocking part P-related interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local prevalence of the resistance to the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms, should provide advice through experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-appealing to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine, Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was initiated every day under a occlusion and reduced the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary intraumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording in man according to topical application of 1% obe on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the inapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid.</seg>

<seg id="2714">The file controller must ensure that a pharmaceutical application system will ensure that a pharmaceutical application system will be present in the module 1.8.1 for the authorisation application (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed as long as the product used to be marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of approval for the insolvency plan includes more detailed studies and additional pharmacovigatory activities, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates to the RMP, which have been agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human use," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic safety update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated place, you should end the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on an area that is treated with Altargo when it was not expressly prohibited from your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in your eyes, mouth, or in the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the sage looks into one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your physician about advice if complaints occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient temperature is used for the protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used within two doses of an existing vaccine, but a protection against hepatitis B may not be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, you can only use Ambirix if the risk of hepatitis B infection is made and ensured that the vaccination can be taken at the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refreshment dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or -B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by protecting the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix also contains the same components such as the vaccine Vrix Adults and has been approved by the Vrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same illnesses, but Twinrix Adults and Twinrix children are administered in one of three doses of an existing vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the use of Twinrix Adults, also used as proof for the use of ambient rix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indication for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody-concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine is compared with a six-month range and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix took place between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar in a hexagonal and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain on the injections, redness, mateness (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react sensitively to the active ingredients (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic), not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologica s.a. approval for the placing on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the underdization of ambient beats is made up of two vaccinations, the first dose of the choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher is desired both for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovent vaccines or a combination vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B- surface antigen (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HbsAg) antibody-antibody index values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not totally secured whether immunotherapy persons, which are addressed to a hepatitis A vaccine, may require a refresher than protection, since it may also be protected by immunological memory as well.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine there is appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring always available.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization of hepatitis B is recommended to be able to form 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody is achieved so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration might lead to an suboptimal vaccination program, this injection methods should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of throbocytopenie or bleeding problems, Ambirix can be injected once subcutaneous in these cases when intramuscular administration may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered at the same age of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azellular Pertussisus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- mumps Vöttine vaccine was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immune disease, or in patients suffering from immunity, possibly no sufficient immunity response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccination doses of this formulation, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matology, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever is comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former thiomerised and preservative-containing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the tolerability of ambient agrix was compared to the 3-dosing combination dies.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and disturbance on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed according to the gift of Ambirix at 50.8% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who received the Ambirix have been vaccinated over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects that were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, incidence of mattresses was comparable high (i.e. about the total vaccination cycle of 39.6% of the subjects, the ambient temperature were compared with 36.2% of the subjects that received the 3-cans combination fluid).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of impregnated pain and fulness was low and comparable to, that was observed after administration of the Combination vaccinated with the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions were comparable to the ambient temperature in the Ambience group with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year old, however, vaccination with ambient beats a common occurrence of pain (on the injectable) per dose, not per tape, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which reported about severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with the combination case of 360 ELISA- units with the combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials which were carried out in vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years, the anti-HAV 99.1% had a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-hbs rate for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined vaccinated with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose regimes was significantly higher than the ambient temperature.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 year olds a month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e. a month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines either received a 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were detected over at least 24 months after immunisation with ambient atmosphere in 0-6-months vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those, which were determined after vaccination of 3 doses of a combinant Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to that in 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of ambient rix took place at the same time with the finding of a combined diphtheria, tetanus- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation for adults, shown for current formulation-like seroprotection and serum samples such as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine will be examined both before and after resuspense by eye-loss of any foreign exchange and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">They can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may possibly need a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix not completely protect you from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even when the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are already infected / your child before the administration of both vaccination ambirix already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus (though you feel uncomfortable or feel uncomfortable or feel / feel) a vaccination may not prevent illness.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infection that may harm the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If any allergic reaction to you / your child once again has an allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can express itself by itching skin envelopes, breath of breath or swelling of your face or tongue. • If in you / your child has occurred once an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / her child has a severe infection with a fever / her.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and usually the second vaccination dose) is required.</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it is recommended to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective Hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine, with reduced content of effective substances, is usually administered a month after the first dose, and should give you a vaccination protection from the end of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected when people suffer from severe bleeding problems under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you are weakened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your own immune defence / or if you / your child tended to undergo a hemorse.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on the vaccine can't be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Please take your doctor if you / her child will take another medicine if you have been vaccinated (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you have been vaccinated without any prescription? or if you have given birth to immunoglobulins (antibodies), or that he is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient, and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and packs up to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which has become known since issuing the first approval for the marketing, the CHMP compares that the value-risk ratio for ambient temperature is positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited to small patient exposition.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with a complete encephaly effect, or with hypertonic encephalopathy (brain damage to high concentrations of ammoniakconcentrations) in the history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonite is divided into several single doses to meals - shocked, mixed with food, or via a gastrostomieschltoo (through the abdominal wall in the stomach-leading tube) and a Nasensonde (through the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study, since ammondy could not be compared to another treatment or placebo (an apparent drug, i.e. without the active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonite may also contribute to appetite, abnormal acid content in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid rejection, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Humanist PMP (CHMP) concluded that ammonium in patients with disturbances of the urine cycle could be effective.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved in "exceptional circumstances," because of the rare circumstances of the disease only limited information on this drug was given.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The action is indicated in all patients, with which a complete enmmangel is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 living days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifested form (a complete enzyme that manifests itself after the first age of life) there is an indication for the use when in the history of a hyperammonite encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, suitable for infants, who are not able to swallow pills or for patients with swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium polyphenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine suffer from a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required at an early manifeiting deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a ArgininosuccinatSynase deficiency must be arginine in a dose of 0,4-0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 to 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing, as an risk for origination of osophagulzera is when tablets were not immediately coming into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet of AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) of sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium a 20 g sodium polyphenylbutybean, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Thus, AMMONAPS should therefore be used with congenital heart failure or severe cardiac insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and eye-forming clinical conditions, only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and separation of sodium polyphylbutybean over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">For subcutaneous offering of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neural proliferation and to an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also resulted in a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate in human breast milk will be eliminated, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during standstill time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these unwanted events has been assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An improbable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient in conjunction with lactic acid outlet, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdosage occurred in a 5 months old infant with a special single dose of 10 grams (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go coincided with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dosismal neurotoxicity at a intravenous dosing of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active link which conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both compounds contained 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative straps for the separation of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with dysfunctions from the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram of genomic sodium polyphenylbutybean between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is prematurely and the treatment is immediately begun to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always inflows, and the disease led himself in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitric-free analogues after the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemisis, the use of alternative ways of nitric acid separation (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein reduced the diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase the survival rate of newborn cases (however within the first month of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it came with the time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifested form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygical form of Ornithinly carbons amylase-deficiency), that were treated by a hyperammonilic encephalopathy and permanently treated with sodium polyphenylbutyrate and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some cases, a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrin is oxidized to phenylacetric, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after the gift of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium polyphenylbutyat for a single dose of 5 grams of sodium polyphenylbutybean and treated with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous gift of sodium polyphenylbutyat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium polyphenylbutyat in tablets, 15 minutes after taking placable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the next morning, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was detectable in plasma using different doses phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three of six patients with liver cirrhosis which were repeated having been treated with sodium polyphenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentration on the third day was five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Exposition The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium polyphenylbutyrin treated with toxic and non-toxic doses treated rats (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules is either taken by oral (babies and children who can not swallow any tablets, or patients with siblance) or over a gastrostomieschltoo or a Nasensonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium polyphenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serumproteins should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine suffer from a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required at an early manifeiting deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium polyphenylbutyat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium a 20 g sodium polyphenylbutybean, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat liver were exposed before the birth of Phenylacetic (active metaboite of phenylbutyrin), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An improbable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient in conjunction with lactic acid outlet, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>

<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the separation of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urine cycle can be assumed that for each gram of genomic sodium polyphenylbutybean between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some cases, a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2862">With this proposal, the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8,6 g sodium polyphenylbutyat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium polyphenylbutyat is up to 5 grams in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare cases, such liver enzymes are missing, so that they can accumulate the nitrogen-containing waste products that can accumulate in consumption after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are carried out in your laboratory studies, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium polyphylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist, if you have taken other medicines or recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During standstill time, you can't take AMMONAPS while the medicine could move into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disorders, afternobility, memory disorders, memory disorders, and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you find any of these symptoms, you are immediately set up with your doctor or the emergency intake of your hospital in an introduction to an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">After taking AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes of bleeding (red blood cells, white blood cells, throatocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, kidney problems, weight gain and abnormal lab values.</seg>

<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS in equal individual outlets or via an gastric fistle (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a Nasensonde (hose that is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take out of the container a heaped measuring spoon Granules. • Cut off a straight edge, e.g. a measuring spot on the edge of the knife to remove surplus granulate. • Get the recommended number of spoonfuls Granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat patients with "acute matonarsyndroms" (ACS, lowered blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (abnormal measuring value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">When angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who submit to a PCI, a higher dose is administered, and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with Angina or heart attack to maintaining the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole gift or in connection with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, a different drug for preventing blood clots) compared with the conventional combination treatment with hepatitis (another anticoagulant) and a GPI compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patients often used a Stent (a short tube that remains in the antry to prevent shutter), and they received additional medicines for preventing blood clots, such as ccioximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">During the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without gift from GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or Revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI, Angiox was in terms of all indicators as effective as Heparse, except for heavy bleeding in which it was significantly more efficient than Heparse.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angioxical may not be used in patients who possibly insensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other miludine, or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must not be used in patients who had recently had a blood pressure, as well as in humans with high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or cardiac infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Humanist Holders (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is a acceptable replacement for Heparders during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd. a approval for the marketing of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute matonarsyndromes (unstable Angina / non - ST-Hebrint) (IA / NSTEMI)) is required for emergency access or an early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initiation dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt rating of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in further episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, after clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of impact.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and one of this immediately followed by intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a sole Bolus-gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt rate of 0.3 mg / kg / kg should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully administered prior to application and administered it rapidly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT exceeds 225 seconds, additional monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), a PCI should be submitted (whether with bivalrudin against ACS), a lower incendiary rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to date and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is again checked.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which led to the approval phase III- PCI-trial (Replace-2), which were included for approval, the ACT is 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosing adjustment when an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also with dialysis cases Angiox contraindicated (see paragraph 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can terminate 30 minutes after the termination of the intravenous gift of unquestionable Heparine or 8 hours after the termination of the subcutaneous offering of low-molecular heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients depend carefully to monitor symptoms and signs of bleeding in combination with another anticoagulant, especially if Bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if this PCI-patient can occur in most of arterial punctuation in most cases, in patients receiving a percutaneous corrosion intervention (PCI), during the treatment in principle, bleeding occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR Werts (International standard debt ratio) should be prevented, in order to ensure that the value of treatment with bivalirudin again reached the existing level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or Throbocytenswirl), it may be assumed that these active ingredients increase blood risk.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with throcytic aggregates or anticoagulants are the clinical and biological hemostatic parameters in any case regularly.</seg>

<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately canceled and the patient is engaging with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinor, binds in both the catalytic center as well as in the Anionenbinder region of thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or on Gerrit.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The connection of bivalirudin at thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible because Thrombin sutteth the binding of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly making the function of the active center of thrombin regenerates.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm injected or as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for glucose monitoring (sugar) in blood or does not process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin distinguishes itself very marginally of human insulin, and the change means it is faster and a shorter period of time has a short-effective humankind.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a lengthy insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in one study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">With type 2 diabetes, in which the insulin does not work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indication for the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% was observed after six months (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% on insulin injections.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who possibly insensitive (allergic) against insinglulisin or one of the other ingredients, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adapted, if it is taken together with a number of other medicines that can counteract on the glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH granted approval for the marketing of Apidra in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is subcutaneous injections of subcutaneous injections in the area of the abdominal wall, or subcutaneous injections through continuous infusion in the field of abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin delivery, the insulin need for patients with a limitation of liver function could be diminished.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the amount of effect, the mark (heart sticker), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinkable etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3- A insufficient dosage or termination of a treatment, in particular patients with a insulin requiring diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazir; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Feeding a patient on any other insulin type or insulin delivery should be carried out under controversial supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin shots and can therefore change in changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances which can increase the blood sugar level and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, oral antidiabetic, angioxetine-converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, propoxyphic, phosphate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, sympatholymers such as bed blockers, clonidin, Guanethidine, and reserves can be minimised or missing the symptoms of adrents counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments for reproductive-toxicity showed no differences between intra- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is overflowing into human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not appear in the breast milk, nor will it resorates according to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the clinical studies that are listed in clinical trials (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 10, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequencies based on the disposition of these paletor data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - weld, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation, drowsiness, drowsiness, drowsiness, vision of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is failed to continuously change the injection device within the injection unit, in the sequence a cerebroystrophy ocystrophy occur.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycemia associated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriated person, or is treated by a doctor according to the intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a Gluatagoninject, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of serious hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibiting of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that a subcutaneous ga- be carried out faster at subcutaneous gauges of insulin resistance. the effects of action is shorter than for hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin postage in the therapeutic-relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg contains a proportional amount of portional glueing effects, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose monitoring effects, as are human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast mode of action such as normal human insulin and reaches the complete glucose tolerance effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clearly evident that an application of insulin macular glycaemic control is reached in 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin requiring 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin had been geared in 2 minutes before the meal, a better postdenial control has been given as with a human standard, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control is given as in human normal insulin which is given 2 billion grooving before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to a normal normal level, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as compared to a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin delivery in gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after onset of the meal in comparison to human north-insulin, the 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) was given prior to the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
