the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its low size they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; by taking this easier available .
for more information on the use of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you will find in the manual &amp; con@@ cross section ; .
to load these modules in &amp; conv@@ ex , select Settings extensions .... Open the card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard setup modules from the K@@ DE package ; add @-@ ons . please note that if you have any more modules installed on your system , if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; click on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , which has brought &amp; con@@ cross ; to crash , or the list of crash@@ es if available , if available .
the module an@@ arch@@ ers ( also called folder filters ) can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with the module you can register &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s current working directory on different kind of filters .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree , and open a new window with the DO@@ M which is just displayed . as default , the display begins with the root note of the document , example : the element , all the other knots are sub@@ assemblies of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; displays another view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ ing and text @-@ views to view the contents of your local file system .
the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , scre@@ ed folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the capacity of the size of sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or a folder represents the size of a file or a folder . in this way , large files can be easily identified if they can be seen far below in the file hier@@ archy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap depic@@ ts a rectangle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the right corner of meaningful use and lab@@ eling settings .
the colour of a rectangle , which is switched on display color mode , may be either deep@@ ening for the light detection of the screw depth , or the figure of other file size , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rectangle can be lab@@ eled with the various features of the corresponding file or the folder . for each feature , you can define if enough space is available , or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ated rec@@ tan@@ gles is present ( whereby the values of sub@@ ordin@@ ation occur due to the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . in addition , you can design@@ ate the relative position of labelling in rectangle .
regarding lifting algorith@@ ms , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always marked for setting up the entries must not be available , which is then square to the sub@@ or@@ derly entries , when the rectangle is square .
how to split the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation is left up . it is advis@@ able for the labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses through frames can be created , which are square as possible . the best methods of this regarding lines , columns or recur@@ sive confusion .
you can design@@ ate the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , a voice pattern is drawn into the area of the above @-@ level entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub @-@ designated entry .
initially it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test@@ application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map @-@ Wid@@ get intended for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the ex@@ tern gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

improved database with significantly more met@@ ad@@ ata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; K@@ DE ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . this means , it is on supporting the en@@ roll@@ ers . you should therefore report problems and improvement .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; try to make the mil@@ king of problems or suggestions for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help Menu contains an entry problems or wishes . if you are using this link , your web browser doesn &apos;t open a page in error messages . all required information are already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers are able to help each other . if you have a regular users of &amp; digi@@ ous ; ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ous ; ask yourself some questions to other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ ous site ; please visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous ; to know .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ ous ; registration is included in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
when you get &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . you can enter here a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter your name , or click the folder icon folder order to select folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here your data is stored . this path remains equal to any image folders .
later you can add so many folders such as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ ous ; additionally you will use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ box set up collections
if you already have an image collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , which contains images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ ous ; viewed every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during the search of the folder you will get a progress indicator show how to see this :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; dur@@ ations come true for the li@@ br@@ arian f@@ ad in its whole depth . you can &apos;t lock the sub@@ folder , unless you take off &amp; digi@@ ous file ; do you take a point in front of the name of the sub @-@ folder .
if you take a existing folder with photos as basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List will have no pictures as symbols . you can change this as a random photo from the album and this is used as an album icon . for more details , you will find in the albums section .
once you configured the base file , you can set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use my albums and my sample box to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can handle it ; possibly the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported resource cameras in the Help of Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Help .
how to setup and work with raw files is described in the Sec@@ tions Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
an easy to use camera agency is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ous ; of course more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and any card reader , supported by your operating system , is supported by &amp; digi@@ ous ; working together .
modern digital cameras are used by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera can then be realized via the Picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 is used to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , further @-@ able software collection for digital cameras , which has been constantly developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras are using the serial interface for their communication with the machine . as photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . EX@@ IF support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in lib@@ c@@ photo@@ 2 , you may seem to see any outw@@ ard pictures or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how easy the functionality should be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image Plu@@ gins Interface Project ( Hand@@ book ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ m@@ g. and G@@ wen@@ a . goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement one function , than the changes in &amp; digi@@ ous ; themselves perform .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either change the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
pulling and dismant@@ ling pictures works everywhere : you can store an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , above the horizontal separation line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not stored in keywords , date list , or search .
- a fil@@ en@@ yp@@ so allows you to recover the spread : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , Movies , and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol@@ ism only if this ind of symbol@@ ism is also displayed . which fields can be displayed in the dialog dialog box .
the view &amp; quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; presents a organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be saved in a single Alb@@ um@@ baum , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ites or after the date where the album was first created , sorted out . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan an album Imp@@ orting Pictures . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . select Album Imp@@ orting Image Photo .
to move an image from an album to another or move , you can select the photo with the mouse to move on the target album and go there . in the then published menu , you may need to move or copy multiple photos or copy them . just select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ features allow you information about this collection . to access the album properties , you &apos;ll need to click with the right mouse button on the album and select in the context menu Alb@@ um@@ properties .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums so you can select below a common name . if you &apos;re using the collection , you &apos;ll need to sort or delete records by collection . if you want to add new collections or want to extingu@@ ish you , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used to sort your albums after date with view albums after date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , the latest : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . in this case , first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information , instead , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first enter an album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; it will be selected the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is why the first photo in the album is not representative and you might then choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select at the context menu &amp; quot ; in addition , you can put the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be contained in a collection and collections can &apos;t be mer@@ ited .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports typ@@ ing in brief for individual photos in the field of My keyword list below in the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures are displayed in this album at the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lupine buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open a album the first time you have to wait briefly , while the umb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid any new images in which you can re@@ generate ex@@ chang@@ els in the menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the associated preview site . what information is this you can take about settings digi@@ ous ; insert here the albums page and custom@@ ize your wishes pictures of your wishes .
the show images have a picture window that releases . if you rest the mouse poin@@ ter a moment on a picture . the help shows the main features including all the key features of a photo . screen photo in the main window indicates such an aux@@ iliary window .
photos are all about how it is at &amp; digi@@ ous ; lets you organize your pictures as it fits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach the menu image menu in the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide or the processing of pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F4 Image Editor ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Pictures . in the digi@@ al section , you can find a manual how you can view your photos . with the picture editing you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ ous ; the functionality you need not to open . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button . you can adjust the menu on the file type with the &amp; K@@ DE ; file arrangements for the file type , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; K@@ DE ; manual .
you should note that , according to the processing of other image editing software , you cannot save these data with the image contained in the image if you do not store the modified image . thereby , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending , etc .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; provides two ways to make rotation . the easiest way to click on the right mouse button to select and choose . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photos , you can select with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 format name from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you remove a photo from &amp; digi@@ ous ; delete it in tr@@ ash bin &amp; K@@ DE ; post@@ pon@@ ed the F@@ 8 image extingu@@ ishing or ent@@ f If you prefer rather del@@ e@@ tion , you can do this by using Shift ; ent@@ f .
view &amp; quot ; my Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos from the data . &amp; digi@@ ous ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ ashe@@ et below in the dat@@ ashe@@ et , so that only the photos of the selected days are shown .
photos with reference answers provide a flexible and powerful possibility to organize your photos and catalogues . keywords are stick@@ ers that can be assigned by individual photos or whole groups . once a sample is assigned to a photograph , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos , which were marked with this keyword , are displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this way , you can log@@ ically organize your table . you can also summar@@ ize parts of the tree &amp; quot ;
the key features are stored in a database for quick access and access keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . moreover , the keyword will be re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ ous ; the pictures notice .
you can add new words by clicking on &amp; quot ; My details &amp; quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select new keyword if you cli@@ cked a new keyword after you cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be provided by this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select delete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . just the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a sample by drag them to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then , a menu , which gives you the possibility to slide the keyword . a keyword may be only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a sample by clicking with the right mouse button and select at the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as Alb@@ um@@ vor@@ schau . in addition , you can put the photo on the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
um &amp; digi@@ ous ; s have to deal with keywords in brief , you must first set up your photos with reference . this can be done on two ways : once you have chosen the photos , you can also click on the corresponding key word in the tree &amp; quot ;
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . this photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords to it on a photo , one for the place where the photo was done , one for the event where the photo was done , etc .
once you have a photo with brief , this is shown below the image of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open and select the context menu of the photos and select from the menu @-@ menu . the menu only shows the key words that were assigned to the photo .
the time beam view shows a tim@@ eless hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a box can select over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box . in this way , all the related pictures are displayed in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . then , it appears in the list below .
cover all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amps and in the future even more .
Neb@@ ras@@ er Such@@ box is a small lamp that will be green if the search finds hits . when you click here , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed . if the search has nothing found , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this , but you can find this search for a Live Search , which always filter out what you have been entered as a search crit@@ eri@@ on . after you have saved the tab @-@ d filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . the text box location is used to order your request to get a name in My search list . if you select your selection for the search again , you need to select the corresponding entry from the view of My search list and select an option in his context menu .
if you select search , select the form for entering the search again with previously chosen search information . if you select an advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the extended search .
if you want to delete a existing search from the list , select the context menu search .
the Extended search displays you an extended search form with many search parameters available , where you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ous ; s database can be found .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the alb@@ um@@ aten@@ bank . any option can add or delete this list with other details about the logical operations . each option can be associated with other about the logical operations ( ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... ) . furthermore , you can create searching for the type &amp; quot ; AND TH@@ ICH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; digi@@ ous ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair @-@ algorithm . this allows you to compare these signature between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond to . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is a range in which you can drop any picture . using a swelling , the results can be enlarged and shr@@ inks . if you move an image from anywhere from the symbol of un@@ exact search in the left side bar , then you will open it and you can drop it there .
sk@@ etch : free and colour sk@@ etch : draw a sk@@ etch Sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ ous ; find the appropriate pictures here . also here a swelling can be set .
this rider makes an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button@@ ing to move a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this requires naturally your pictures are ge@@ o @-@ data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o @-@ filter . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a Live Ge@@ o@@ ord@@ ner .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; provides a illuminated display in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported picture data formats , including raw files , together .
choose one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The lumin@@ ance are added to the table menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated menu and its windows . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window , you can open the ligh@@ tening fast with L Extras .
from the preview can you compare the pictures you want to see in the left or right area of the window and place there . if you synchron@@ ize a preview in which window area you choose from the tool bar and zoo or inter@@ section operations on one of the images , then you will be able to compare these images in the same image .
another mode is better suited to select fast from a picture series . then , if you are using pair of images , the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields to be used . you can now display the left mouse button on any background picture . this will be displayed on the right next section . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , normal del@@ ays are working directly from the fix@@ ture , e.g. F4 file edit ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main deck are available for both models in the lumin@@ ary table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom of each area you can find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can easily see on the cross@@ roads . in order to hold the visible area of the picture , you have to hold this button and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; both pictures will be shown in the same mode .
the zo@@ oming works as much as in other views . just use the zoom controllers below the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike around into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital content management - away from the fashion word ? a digital content management considers every part of the process as follows after the final edition and the permanent store . each of the photos takes up , sc@@ ans , or digital photos stores a form of digital data management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , protect and use photos . we will focus on the procedure for digital photographs the &amp; digi@@ ous ; we will focus on downloading , ren@@ ame , evaluate , search , search , optimize , optimize , wait and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital identi@@ al administration takes on , indicated , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , cho@@ oses , transformed , con@@ formed , and exports the contents of a mon@@ et@@ ric or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data , information about or documentation of other data , which are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you do more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the approach the met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed both in a database and in the image files , guaranteed very fast searching and secure connectivity to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you need to setup your system structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be saved , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you need to switch it to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found fast about your location . if you were enough photos on the same place . if you &apos;re able to make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a web site .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant access from pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files will have and you will not want to organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . dis@@ connect new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the option met@@ ad@@ ata in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ ous ; it ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can restart the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by choosing the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? and , &amp; digi@@ ous , a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attribute settings are available . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , as you should select each photo keywords , inscri@@ ptions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all pictures , which need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos .
now let &apos;s talk with keyword , key words , as you are running in other programs common , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catal@@ og@@ ed images from another source with embedded stit@@ utes , then &amp; digi@@ ous ; automatically insert the tree for you or attach the pictures to the correct place . the conversion of the hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can simply by removing a sub @-@ tree to one another . the changed keywords will be followed by &amp; digi@@ ous ; updated while the sub@@ trees are tra@@ ced .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data of all pictures .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to certificates or comments using the third most important tool for your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want most ni@@ ers to see your photos easily , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your pictures arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this is the landing field of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ ometer ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y : 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time span is once again present , you may even hear the silence . so the let@@ tering has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others consider the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning to the viewer , to help Him about the motive that she has moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect when it is the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can store any text in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures simultaneously . K@@ DE is even exported to your wishes for your wishes and / or the title of Web @-@ gallery system . so , you have to tell the story for opening up any second time .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet on Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train lear@@ ns the spatial presentation now with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already countless and become even deeper into the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future you can open your travels . you can also export the pictures at the recording location . you can also export the pictures on the recording location . you can also export the pictures as well as G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copyright to remove limitations on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description says which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ ous ; as information stored should :
author ( syn@@ onym for narr@@ ator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer , for example , if it wasn &apos;t checked , the name of a company or organization can be used . after this value , it should not be changed . this field does not support Com@@ ma nor Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ating characters .
Aut@@ ot@@ itel ( Syn@@ onym for Constitu@@ tions ) : linked to the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this field contains the title as : employee photographer , Fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mer@@ sion to the car field , this must be filled out .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the an@@ bi@@ d@@ eter@@ feld to identify who you see . if the photographer has been listed here as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations cannot be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then here the group / Agency is listed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . each of which is a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator , it can only delete a digital water mark . for individuals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important to it .
the digital water@@ mark is once unique . &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the near future , it will provide a module for st@@ acking processing .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or a fire . this type of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which has a loss of data .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs must be careful to fight this c@@ auti@@ ously and you may not get more expensive than a few years . of course you can also hold CDs and DVDs in archive quality . there are offers about Gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 a piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you think it &apos;s in your survey@@ ing game .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ cos and good recording sessions and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you can use much reliable . therefore , it is the right to choose the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you were just written . therefore , use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and control unit . despite this massive protection it requires chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a reasonable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster , which runs for Windows and Linux ; but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to be able to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to Blu @-@ ray discs .
keep up slowly with a good recording device to high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author &apos;s mark and afterwards in a clean , dark dry and in animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ats reserve their statistics for itself . their manufacturers warranty include a new disk , but not the data . Google puts on this subject a major field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ missing det@@ ectors
in brief , Dis@@ ks keep the longest if you operate in the temperature range between 35 ° C and 45 ° C . at lower temperature control , the most common error of errors are the most frequently forth@@ coming failure . these are especially re@@ prob@@ able and publishing stor@@ yt@@ ellers . the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is a complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electricity loss before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be produced without any major problems .
while most electric appliances do not make a lot of equipment , these anom@@ ali@@ es can take these anom@@ ali@@ es with computer chips and high speed processes . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe loss , hardware age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so , protect yourself from the inev@@ itable that causes a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against black@@ sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of energy saving . it is usually available in the form of a slot bar . however , remember that not any plug @-@ bar also contains a power supply protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage safety , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum protection . you should also ensure that it offers protection against ligh@@ tening strikes and thus protecting the right devices .
since you can use an over@@ voltage every cable to your computer , you should pay attention that all periph@@ er@@ als can also be connected to your system . some manufacturers are also able to provide a phone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable transition protection . a multitude of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore you are also very small and you also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in power lines , it will not really help you in a complete loss . even a few seconds may lead to loss of int@@ oler@@ able data . therefore , it can be sensible to invest in a inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
besides protection from over@@ voltage gri@@ ps , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy when a power loss occurs . this gives you the possibility to keep your data back up to the current . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like a over@@ voltage safety . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
remember the potential risk which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in power disorders with the cost of avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think . finally , you should always remember all cables before going on holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy Storage Service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destinations for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offering to store any data stored .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send data on compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable for a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a poor solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available online storage services that are available on photos stored . your professional version is more available to you , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you &apos;ll get unlimited memory , which should be checked into reality .
data protection from the point of view are the web solutions very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted for adjust@@ ing to the TCP protocol and included in the big companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . there@@ with , they are deser@@ ving .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs reflect at least the data integral between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one says you if a transmission error occurred , not when it was destroyed in your hardware . all this distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection to your computer . nobody seems to have thought it in your computer . nobody seems ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly more secure data path than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable grid parts are a further source of transmission ratio because they generate inter@@ medi@@ aries within the data streams . at normal fil@@ esystem , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not concerned about transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate failed and is highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope to see it for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that used and is also available for Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate these two factors ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook &amp; 46 % for work@@ top systems . Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for long no longer sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if however , a file is not completely stored before the problem arises , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main cause of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continued to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and nar@@ c@@ ological characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deterior@@ ating . even DS@@ LR cameras have a 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel sensor . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other responsible for data loss . thus , make your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything more dangerous than the re @-@ installation of your operating system , make the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives .
suppose you are daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accident , fire , water , electricity , children and theft release are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or complete house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ous therefore means not a local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring home , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a more common reason for a loss of data loss despite ensuring the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a moment of history without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
prevention : a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete moment of moment at two time points : completion and the last difference .
in@@ creative backup : a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . produced several moments . you can restore the original status at any time back to one such backup . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only fast@@ ed and not continuously running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool which you can easily setup your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer Scri@@ pts r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens , and if you want to increase security about ssh .
backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD , or another optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore us . at the same time , you come back for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of work files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment of time for at least one month and a moment of moment for every month . each other di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , equ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you need to consider and re@@ assess the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to let yourself as the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document . use and switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , store and locking technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expert pressure for the opportunity to change a system in its size . this really means ampli@@ fy .
let &apos;s go that you have set the scal@@ ability with the plans and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and lay it onto a new plate :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them .
&amp; dollars ; dd f = / dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ LE ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it , then you can create this yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG is an open source standard designed to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is loss @-@ free , supported by X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata . P@@ NG can require a relative amount of administration reports , but not as many as T@@ IFF , but not as many as T@@ IFF , and we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely used as an image format . T@@ IFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression level ( Def@@ late ) . however , it is managed to store your pictures in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital negatives file format is a license @-@ free and open resource format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on T@@ IFF / EP format and required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful of camera manufacturers is currently available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is used with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers draw it in front of an original recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive the met@@ ad@@ ata is specified separately from the image file . it can also be noted on the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata and the image file and as mentioned above , you should think about whether you &apos;re using D@@ NG as containers and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application purposes and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I belongs to the activities of architecture and modelling , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds and conn@@ aissance efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata ards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures are based on the camera , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you come back with &amp; digi@@ ous , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut off under any circumstances from other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it into Web@@ gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , please print in contact page , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ous . in the section adding a photos to an album you can add a description of how you have already installed on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing photos to your album bench .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous ; connect these with the machine , turn on the camera to the display mode and turn on them . another description is available in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to last with your camera . if the connection is manufactured , a fermentation indicator appears at the bottom and show images of all photos on the camera . if this is the case , file names will appear , and a symbol for the file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information about every entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a entry or his met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows the file properties and the photo information that are stored on the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer . note that there are not all information available at some digital cameras .
the rider met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturing tool@@ ing , GPS etc of the image . this information is the same as the met@@ ad@@ ata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ous ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ ous ; for downloading the photos were not deleted , and we will be sure to retri@@ eve the pictures directly into an album before you delete photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the default optional options of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the pictures you can download and then selected the button . the button selected can be stretched out until you &apos;ve selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new download option is available . these pictures have been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ous ; download . in this case , the new pictures are downloaded with a star in advance windows . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you can download the buttons all of you download or selected files , a dialogue with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are sorted . details of the existing albums are sorted , as usual folder you can follow in section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ous ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all the button once you want to delete all the button . if you want to delete only some , you must first select this first and then delete files .
please note that there are no possibility to restore photos from the camera . so the photos will not be deleted in the tr@@ ash &amp; K@@ DE ; so they should be completely deleted . if you want to delete the camera system completely before you want to delete the camera limit , because this is much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful . this can run into a double fil@@ en@@ ame if you upload photos of different recording criteria into the same album . therefore , it may be useful , the date and the time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the picture and for data bases . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day .
the options during the transfer opens three additional options to be performed before the photos on the record are stored on the record . if you select this , the corresponding entries of the EX@@ IF information is copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish to read another file format as the standard format , you can add the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . then turn the option to date and time . for more custom@@ iz@@ ations you should read the command str@@ au@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or if you prefer , if you prefer this option .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ ous file ; for a photo is used underneath the name that the camera is available in the preview of the name . your settings can be stored and automatically , when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; can use any information on the camera &apos;s orientation of the camera to perform automatic turning during the shut @-@ up time . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo .
the automatic turning is normally switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , take the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn out the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window .
when your camera offers information on the date that the photo was made available , it can take &amp; digi@@ ous ; this sub@@ strate is based on the image data . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same Sub@@ titled . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section page side@@ bar met@@ a data , you can follow what information about your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ ous ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the Advanced button and select the date of date @-@ based sub@@ strate at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their machine to your camera is the button to download . then select upload . the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded to you . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you , where the pictures are to be uploaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload , and the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude . identi@@ fying the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional Phot@@ ograph@@ ers can link it an image with a precise geographical spot . not everyone uses an airplane to take an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot where the photo was done , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users who want to loc@@ alize the place of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to add to the position data of a photos .
the question is how come the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 are supported many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ working of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geograph@@ ic allocation ( manual ) and last about the manual input of well known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integ@@ rates a GPS unit . however , there are a couple who work with GPS recei@@ vers together . either as a card module or transm@@ itting the data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
the download of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , however , this data must be stored in the GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the module to geograph@@ ic assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from GPS . on the following page , you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ l by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign@@ alling code that will be created for example map@@ s.@@ google .

save images as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you may add to your photos , with the images embedded in the pictures . this allows you to inscri@@ bed your inscri@@ ptions as well . warning : in pictures which already lab@@ eled messages are over@@ written by the &amp; digi@@ ous ; over@@ written .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the main window via a file . according to chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ ous ; to be fixed , you can add the extension of this list and remove any file in a &amp; digi@@ ous ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no such extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ ous ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button Ref@@ resh right from each category .
the settings of the ceiling of &amp; digi@@ ous ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , if you can open the illuminated mode . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get any more stim@@ ulus . if you have one , then you can get a better viewing results .
by default , editing takes a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this one here . you can adjust the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing can be set off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia to the higher resolution .
with the setting P@@ NG @-@ compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation reduces the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means a low and 9 means a high compression .
using the T@@ IFF @-@ files option , you can switch the default value compression level for T@@ IFF @-@ pictures . this reduces the size of T@@ IFF @-@ pictures . it has no influence on the image quality because the default @-@ level algorithm has been loss @-@ free .
with the adjustment loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you have been written the loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported yet , but in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ ous , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs . currently it is very fast to develop a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default im@@ itate is that all green pixels are the same . if you use an odd @-@ to @-@ ultra@@ violet light when using this option , you solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option records this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gain with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the Weiß@@ er is using the camera . otherwise , if set , automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a fixed colour balance , based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji super CCD SLR cameras . by using the second sensors , the effect has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the tops . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the peak beam , so the parts of your pictures are burned to the peak of your camera , as long as going through to the in@@ ability of your camera . you can solve the setting in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the sh@@ lich@@ és .
this is possible , as blue pixels could not be filled as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ous ; and d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the still saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how many color or white you want .
selecting the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise , and / should therefore be adapted for each image separately .
set the L@@ umin@@ ous value to your taste . you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ ous ; -@@ image processing will be done . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ gene , you should be conservative .
a demo @-@ based algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial data image that will have many cameras and which is a matrix @-@ colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; and D@@ cra@@ w make you three alternatives to you : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests , it was used as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation was used ( for adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity photographs ) , but it was used as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation was used ( for adap@@ tive homogen@@ e@@ ity ) . however , it produces color photos to the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting , if you &apos;re looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome .
if you know the colour vari@@ ance of your lenses , you can set the rot@@ or and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for colour@@ ing correction , as it is carried out during the extraction .
one profile transl@@ ates the color information and returns as this again . there are also lo@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ous ; information such as color information from a colour space in the other are to translate the colors as exactly as possible .
behavior issues , when a picture is opened in image processing / colour management module with raw files .
colour profile folder setting here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you all put up all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ous ; investigated this folder then during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard deposit ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . only your pictures are colored not the entire screen .
the input file should fit to the camera equipment and model you can use . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain any colour mapping or gam@@ em@@ correction . this is currently corrected d@@ cra@@ w gamma not for conver@@ sions with 16 bit depth . this means you need to conduct the colour mapping itself .
there are other options such as the soft profile profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your printer might be given back as your printer . this is very useful before you print picture , because your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colours are therefore very satisfied , instead of switching to the blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them for what is intended for . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this response is of course un@@ official :
the Canon extension extension makes the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewer and image editing ; many modules support , which were written to cooperate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these modules will be downloaded as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the Settings menu .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals for the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the di@@ asch@@ au settings should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adjusted the time between the image outputs , usually it is 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other input fields turn the met@@ ad@@ ata a or out , which appears at the bottom end of the pictures during display .
the camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection that is connected to a camera that is connected to the computer . among them are the port settings . currently , here Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ memory is supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / notice that you hang on your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ous , you need to connect to your computer with your computer to display and activate them in the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ ous ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option to confirm confirmation of &gt; images in the Mül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ ous ; in the del@@ eting of a photos in an album you can find a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of a album you find more details .
the editorial changes via the right side bar can be tac@@ tically sealed by &amp; digi@@ ous ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side@@ bar , otherwise you will need to apply the changes with the button change .
you can also attach the display of the digi@@ ous paras@@ ol of &amp; digi@@ ous ; for starting sub@@ types , this acceler@@ ates the start process of &amp; digi@@ ous .
the setting of the Start After new photos are for@@ cing &amp; digi@@ ous ; the base file moved to new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the starting time of &amp; digi@@ ous ; then , when something came from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ ous ; you see if it should delete it out of the database .
various color@@ ings can be placed in &amp; digi@@ ous ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . you can select these settings from the tool bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ ous ; to create , find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view and modify your photos and improve image processing can be launched by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the entry and selection of entry display / edit .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ous ; therefore , you are not part of your distribution . more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules are available in section Pictures .
a status bar at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fying factor and the current picture size .
a menu bar at the top margin , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
editing functions of picture editing will change your photos . however , there is no power to change the original photo before you save the file Save or the button stores from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have stored the image .
so , you should be able to setup a copy of your image before you change it . you can save you with file Save as possible .
as long as you don &apos;t have stored the photo , you can restore the original picture by using the edit or button the button to restore the image processing , restore any changes that you have done on the photo since the last Save .
virtually every promotion of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or re @-@ manufactured . the last promotion can be revers@@ ed by using editing editing and select editing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make sure to restore the key combination file , C@@ tr@@ l ; z for backward and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Turn @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press the back@@ bone or re @-@ button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you &apos;ve started image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture r@@ below or the entries in the menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse bike or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the si@@ zing menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can also use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlargement factor automatically
view Full Screen Picture displays the photo in full screen mode . you will come to the normal view , where you don &apos;t want to change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change this in the setup dialog box &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ ous window . see the section to set up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print images and get the default &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
out of the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sets . you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album Export Manager . if you follow the wiz@@ ard you will only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , the important information and actions available for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available , without the navigation tubes , also available in the image processing , and it will be displayed if one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked :
Click multiple times on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar and disappear again in the rim .
in the let@@ tering view , you can insert or add labelling with unlimited size . note : the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after speaking , you can use either the button on the user or simply switch to the next image , the inscri@@ ptions will then be saved .
in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . but you can also write the met@@ ad@@ ata in the files . this is always done when you select a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the assessment determines a score of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either by a single click on the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation from the page bar is always applied only to a picture . to evaluate more pictures at the same time , select this from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword and a selection box with previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ ous ; session used .
the keyword @-@ tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically to the selected search word . you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief at the typ@@ ing of the sample rate in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set through markings the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main window and select a keyword in the keyword , this only applies to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , If you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter .
the lateral bars keyword is used to change the selection of displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their record , - file , keyword and search results . if in addition , one or more sample filter from the right side is used , only the chi@@ ding of these two is displayed . all displayed keywords are available .
you can also pull and pull off . if the keyword already exists , you can simply move with reference . if the keyword already exists , you can easily put it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . subsequently , a dialogue that you ask if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window indicates the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the keyword filter is based on three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right @-@ word @-@ tree is drawn into the selection and there , a dialogue asked if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be turned off using settings .
if you have a rule with and created it and notice that it should be a or must be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry I was looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already placed in the database .
for example , you can select a Advanced search via all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to type options , just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . see the options then as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution there .
this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this job . I have mostly adapted to &amp; digi@@ ous ; s more specific implementation .
the reason why you set a color @-@ administered workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanner can reach a predic@@ table deviation from the really photographed or sc@@ anned colors . you can print out the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanner and the colours which you print out of your digital dark chamber .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone should know what buttons he must press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tut@@ orial will make you provide sufficient background information about color management . additionally , you should make links with deeper information enabling you to make the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows are fulfilled every six below criteria , you do not need to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space ( see below )
your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or web , where the RGB the de @-@ facto standard is .
so , if s@@ RGB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy , why should I use another colour space and have to worry about color breaks ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in contrast to the colors we can really see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger farms , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! if you work in the s@@ RGB @-@ color space or not , you have to install your monitor because it &apos;s RGB to s@@ RGB , so you have to use your monitor to the RGB values of s@@ RGB , then you have to use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that may improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before using a further manual processing .
the capabilities norm@@ alize , un@@ equal , automation and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ise Autom@@ atical correction automatically try to make the best . you will be experim@@ enting with these effects , to see which appears the best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled through the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its colour sha@@ dows . this feature is often a magical correc@@ ting for pictures the dark or well @-@ grown .
un@@ equal : this method is adjusted to adjust the illumin@@ ant protection of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity of the picture is as flat as possible . in this way , the result is very good results in the improvement of a picture , sometimes produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic control : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjustment of the red , green and blue channels across the entire history of hist@@ ograms .
contrast extended : this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by post@@ p@@ one the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible range and a re@@ ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the Weiß@@ ab@@ equals from &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white ab@@ bot of a photos .
the white balance is something limited since about a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour is worked . if you are now too far from the original image , areas with over@@ supply can occur . if you work the white , in the 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction shall be better .
this tool is based on a white balance of white , the copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can launch it via the menu entry color white immediately of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image as well as the preview of the target is adapted . if you want to see the original whit@@ ening immediately , it is enough to click on the window .
the preview of the target photos has a red markers . the lumin@@ ance of the Pi@@ xels under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
to the right there will be a hist@@ ogram that dynam@@ ically changes once you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in good illuminated images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ous values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjustments will enhance the shadow details of your photos or also di@@ mm@@ ing down .
up with the controls mentioned above , you should use the colour temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the white comparison . in this way , the temperature and green values are also set automatically .
additionally , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator provides the colours when more than a colour channel of the Pi@@ xels is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance sheet . this will appear in a preview of pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons stores as and store exactly this . any setting of the cup you have set to store with a text file and re @-@ charge later .
the button settings pres@@ ets all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white cover . note that even neutral settings are displayed another photo than your original . if you save this save your original image .
you can adjust the code depth for each color channel of the processed picture . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding is also needed for high quality images , but this coding is also required for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF , and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles . colour ton@@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for your hel@@ mets . a detailed manual for the use of colour profiles can draw you to the chapter of color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and therefore always need the same correc@@ tions . in the manual for sound value correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you will find gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous tool gives you four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter available .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the picture was completed . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier from the extra light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas of dark and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is possible . a further increase was created and finally a negative picture that does not produce phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar thermal effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that is edited ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation because he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized colour film which is produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ d@@ as strongly managed to make him a film of choice for wildlife photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly offers a few photographs of which the little landscapes are given , too much .
ne@@ on filters sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light to the contra@@ sts . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeat@@ ings generate the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures , the filter can hold the entire CPU for one moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it &apos;s not unusual you want to fix the colour con@@ jun@@ ctions and the brightness of the photos . you can see the different color effects of your photos with the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you have a photo at bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too big sati@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to increase your satur@@ ation instead . all changes you can carry out in the preview . if Him like this , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple cand@@ y strength / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve exposure time . even if the dialog becomes very complicated to improve the application , you need only the area of the sli@@ der . more specifically the three slides below the hist@@ ograms .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph there are three sli@@ ders in the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move regul@@ ators and make sure how the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , updated from the image of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
scale : with this selection box can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar will contain the linear hist@@ ogram of a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic agreement is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for middle tones , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color@@ all@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadow , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area . here , there are also two controllers can be used to evaluate the output values . for example , the compression of output values can be used as background , while doing something else in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the picture value of the image .
store as and store : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and re@@ loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically adjusted to all sha@@ dows , means and sun sets . enable the color value to set the hist@@ ories of the hist@@ o@@ program for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous channels .
the option over@@ exposed se@@ di@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is with ( 1 ) and the corrected figure with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview can be updated dynam@@ ically in depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel , which is changed from the module :
next to this box are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . usually the linear mode of sensu@@ al mode is usually created . for pictures with large areas of constant colour the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a c@@ vent@@ ing to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright notes correspond with dark output stages , and the corresponding image size is dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking can be seen . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the curve , a fitting line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it to and off until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve can be created with this file system . file format is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ ven@@ format .
if you create this method and the three color boxes , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun @-@ tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the original pattern to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ exposed se@@ di@@ ator controls all color channels in order to display exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is a indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance canal . shadow and sun tones have been applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer der &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels , or to change the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix colour sha@@ des of images . you can edit it from the color @-@ mixer of the image processing .
with the channel optional box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by correct the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window indicates you a preview of : the original can be viewed as comparison of your own riders .
the preview of the target picture has a red markers . if you move this in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to keep this channels . if you do L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture is particularly convenient if you are also able to activate the appropriate color components as the channel mixer then is the tool used to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour is coming to a visible space that occurs on the same spot in the color channel and whose colour sample looks different in each channel . if this is the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion , which you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen .
store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any sound mixer allows you to save and then load it . this used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ exposed se@@ di@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of heaven . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange film : sim@@ ulates a black / white film with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . similar to like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ ter .
red Filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic effects of heaven and can sim@@ ulate moon phases on the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour of color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium sounds as it adds a little cold in the sha@@ kes . this is very similar to the trial of a pressure and the restart in a sep@@ tic go@@ ons . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous tool ; use texture texture . you can use decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
adding a texture to your picture regardless of whether it &apos;s a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on canvas , the style of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the depth and depth of the texture on the image .
a paper textile effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous tool box , a decorative frame can be added to a picture added .
the eye of an amount to keep in the boundaries of a photos is no easy task . it is a possibility to keep his attention to the image . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . under the frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your picture . the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce asc@@ ends it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white images ) with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button and decor@@ atively adding an ornam@@ ental pattern with pattern .
width : width of the frame in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
this with the frame table will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this also includes several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text format , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set with its properties , the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select an frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any attitude you have chosen for your text may be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; and after the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous tool ; tool sten@@ cil to use a template about a painting .
the menu image templates apply in image processing can be used to put templates over a painting .
for the template there is no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be adding with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to remove the file size . if you want to add your Tem@@ plates of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; template list digi@@ ous @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
to use this tool for the first time you need to set your Tem@@ plate folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder you have copied the template file . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder for the template has been given a tree view which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the un@@ man@@ ners of the template .
under the preview , three buttons are available with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button rot@@ ates the under@@ lying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
size reduction : this button reduced the lower image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole image , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
please use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the image will be adjusted automatically to the front size .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; presents three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
the shar@@ per mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Chang .
Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ us is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . he is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alised pictures require an correction of the sharp@@ ness . thus , elements are smaller than the resolution , so that the sharp edges are made up to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more retro@@ fitted than normal cameras for the private user .
JPEG pictures has often been used to have applied internal sharp@@ ening . images in the rough format must always be tigh@@ tened in during processing .
some scanners turn out an sharp@@ ening process already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you will receive your control over your picture .
in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening work@@ load . you can sharp@@ ening it with the menu entry level sharp@@ ening .
they should be careful because the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening raises the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the r@@ ushing . in general , the useful technique increases the sharp@@ ness of one image the tool Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ us . you can find it via the menu entry em@@ rig@@ us@@ us . you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a little soft is much simpler than it . use the tool to sof@@ ten using the menu entry corrosion , and experiment somewhat with settings . the show window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove the veil of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help you edit the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should first be tried out . an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the wrong mask to make strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ats will create in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filters on each side of an edge through the filters . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen pictures of the best in its final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignor@@ ant picture , which is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the reference amount . you can therefore define a minimum difference in order to define an edge of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft shift between tones are exemp@@ t and therefore the beauty errors in faces , heavens and water surface are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied using radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous tool re@@ focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected Un@@ loading filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ er@@ quot ; this is better approach as only trying to sharp@@ ening the photo . it uses a technique to sharp@@ ening pictures is the use of a non@@ sharp@@ ness . Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ us usually takes better results than in@@ war@@ med . you can start from the menu by shooting colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular patch works much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s folding , which leads far from the source pi@@ x@@ ies that are far from the original tor@@ pixel size . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s F@@ oot will even be influenced considerably by distant pixels . this causes undes@@ irable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular plugs . it is the main parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value of 1 good results will result . you can set a higher value if your picture should be very un@@ sharp , but then on hal@@ ves .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still p@@ liable to the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of transform@@ ational at@@ rix . however , an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select big values for the circular sharp@@ ness or Gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select major values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any pitch parameters you have set will be stored for later and then can be loaded then .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correction on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and comp@@ ress pictures , and eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module on the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ening . this might be caused by which un@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it has to create un@@ sharp m@@ asked art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never be removed the effect of the non@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter you can show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the rough mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better for processing small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters on a small focused picture :
the original color image that has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ening correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the kno@@ b level makes the sharp@@ est part of the area , in order to create a naturally more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
the tin@@ ker allows a customized paint for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want to keep blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool calcul@@ ator is one of the most developed tools developed to remove non @-@ specific arti@@ facts with unprecedented velocity .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS label in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains several default settings as Star@@ points , to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can also use the riders smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass deposit over the image . a value of 0.9 should get more details so that no sharp@@ ening is needed . please note that the details should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the direction of direction .
accuracy depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ths evenly across all directions , while a value close to 1 can be observed in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise , a high value of w@@ alled samples will produce a high value in the vicinity of 1 .
fl@@ atten@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor about all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , put this value to the degree of noise in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is related to larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it becomes more difficult , since it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm will pass through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles do have a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length . you should lower the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never get bigger than 2 .
if you want to use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : this option is only low . however , it doubles the duration . however , we recommend it to ex@@ pose it .
the buttons store as and store make exactly this . correct setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and then re@@ loaded later .
picture errors is compar@@ atively very quick at work . however , it can last for a long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition .
below , you can see how image errors can be removed from small arti@@ facts . this module is applied on a photo that has been produced in Guatemala city with an analog camera . the original pattern is shown below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce frame exchange . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter tails .
this tool provides selectable picture filters to remove patches and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects from en@@ c@@ apped pictures from books or magazines .
if you need more information about the sensor noise cameras , you can read it in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain @-@ noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the bottom line advanced settings can remain in default settings .
radius checked the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . major values increase the time that filter per pixel requires and can be administered through the radius of the radius of the image and the colour in it is smoo@@ ther and thus smaller mistakes .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets out the pixel pitch . if it is increased , noise tips are deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details may not get more and noise or sm@@ elling occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it can be too strong , not the whole noise can be removed or r@@ att@@ ach@@ ers can occur . put it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that will be controlled by details -@@ settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we encourage you to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that will be controlled by details -@@ settings .
gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas , which are typically more stronger than to increase . he also wor@@ m@@ ated the shadow zones .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . if it is increased , the edges of the adap@@ tive filter radius will occur on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , r@@ ushing and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear along the edges . it can remove rough@@ er and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and re@@ loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction may change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution is a bit soft to draw , fortunately much simpler than a picture . use the tool@@ tip with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t soft@@ ly and experiment with the gl@@ are . the picture window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo files .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted art@@ ef@@ acts of your images . it is very well adapted to immer@@ se Gau@@ ß &apos;s room , film@@ makers , cr@@ at@@ zer , compression file extensions and local errors associated with image con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture of texture is performed with another tool , the algorithm for restoration . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS label in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ingham and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts Redu@@ ce JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compression man@@ ure , it creates some comp@@ res@@ sions &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ ef@@ quot ; - small standards that are in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these issues .
the buttons store as and store make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with a formal noise ; the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie grain on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and this corrected ( 2 ) .
below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo created with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that have been created by scanning lighting and the photo ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous , tool Hot@@ pixel allows the hot@@ pixel size of photos that have been made with a CCD camera , eight have to be removed . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels represent a problem at high quality raw mode photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ing method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button dark@@ ening . the tool will detect automatic hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to connect the dark screen directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first described as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark screen to the correct picture . note here that the wiz@@ ard will notice the final dark screen and automatically re@@ charges it in the next meeting .
the picture area and preview help you correct within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all stages .
select an area around the faulty pixels in the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ l these pixel blocks . these are the available filters below :
Dur@@ ation : there is an average of the neighbouring pixel size . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ects pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical lines .
linear : all pixels which have a distance from 1 pixel block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel can be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the defective pixel in block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original picture was enlarged by 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. below corners to correct the image .
wide angle lens , especially the in the medium and large photo format , can often do not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ dy ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that the sensor can be reached there . tel@@ e@@ objects below circumstances also demonstrate this behavior .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the bl@@ ending filter which means it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be able , also with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or less , since otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ened effects arise through movement .
using the big exposure areas of today &apos;s filters and colour scanner and video scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ ate filter by sim@@ ulating a equivalent transformation on a shell image that has been made without these filters . the tool of Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is applied to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three additional exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light output absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or by chance to compens@@ ate a density of 2 , de@@ sp@@ richt@@ .@@ Incre@@ ase the density by a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ ting to compens@@ ate it by a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ strength , Con@@ tr@@ ast and Gamma -@@ settings : the processing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the illumin@@ ating thickness of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options . the controllers represent only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re adjustment of exposure of the target picture , let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ous menu ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) to correct picture . a static and contrast ratio was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; lenti@@ cular dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion . color dist@@ ortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct con@@ cave or con@@ stri@@ pe form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar balance effect , but fla@@ p to the edges . this correc@@ ting is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the gra@@ der correc@@ ts the remote corners to the opposite verti@@ ces . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion can be virtually eliminated .
General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the second gra@@ zing . with negative values can be corrected a ton @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion and detect positive values .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the dist@@ ortion . this value affects more than in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameters has the reverse sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value , the image size is new and performs a correction first degree . negative values increase the size reduction in the image .
brigh@@ tly : this value adjustment brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values it increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of dist@@ ortion correct . the values that you use for your image will be stored and the next start is used as default values .
the t@@ anning and cau@@ stic correction should be carried out in front of all the cutting or size changes . the best way to cut this correction as all the first . if you have to cut a picture newly and then create a ton @-@ shaped correction it would be the effect of the wrong one .
to help you find the best correction you can find a vertical and horizontal aid line to you . move it to an important place , such as the se@@ ash@@ ore , or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place . in the following , you can correct the t@@ onne / cold @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion with the help of lines .
if you have a correct dist@@ ortion part , the resulting image will have black corners . you can easily remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformation or cross the control kno@@ b of this dialogue .
for most of the pictures a ton @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as photos of front , frames and paintings are the perspective so to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of a ton @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating infrared film , which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview of the window . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can sim@@ ulate two parameters set up movie screens and film@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( ISO ) . enable the option to sim@@ ulate films from a highly sensitive film . the ISO controllers changes the amount of film@@ making and predomin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filters color channels to produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , because the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red fil@@ ming applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the illustrated image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the lace .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter film@@ making is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for producing film@@ making on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , well known to increase the sensitivity of the movies .
the film@@ makers effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere loos@@ ened from daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , photographic photographic , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the body weight . the default value is , although rather higher levels need to use at ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of a film coating effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and that worked ( 2 ) . the used hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil paintings . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil paintings . natural images and style are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . top of the top cho@@ oses the pin@@ point between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suitable for large pictures . fl@@ atten@@ ing controls the gl@@ are or , from the other side view , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original pattern is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and Gl@@ are 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter charcoal drawing used color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal mine . images whose gra@@ dient could change slowly , therefore , if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch for you . this would be good pictures to begin with it .
there are two controllers with a range of ranges from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper kno@@ b cho@@ oses the pin and the lower adjust the contrast ( gl@@ are ) .
this is an example of the drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can still be improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped on wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , where color does not use the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ al landscape .
depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering process . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image in cells , and lets it look as if it looks through glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ ed blocks 1 is dist@@ orted here with another version of gl@@ itter@@ ing blocks .
some effects need long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using a sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Di@@ shar@@ per : wi@@ pe the image along the circular lines that origin@@ ate from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ pose a zo@@ om@@ al camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al non@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pe the picture by turning the pixels around a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distances : the picture shows the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to re@@ sign in the background .
motion of motion : ignor@@ ant the picture by horizontal mot@@ ions of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
soft sub@@ sharp@@ ness : ignor@@ ant the picture soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amer and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle light .
shooter : wi@@ pe the image by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the def@@ ici@@ aries of an arbitr@@ ary camera .
intelligent Dis@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the Far@@ ms in the image and wi@@ pe them out without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and then created by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need long time to calculate and cause high CPU load . you can thus break this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice small tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorith@@ ms .
drop size allows to change the size of the dri@@ ps . since the drop size doesn &apos;t grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number is changing the number and the density of drops . fish@@ way changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing a range free of shelves . do not use the option to select the range , e.g. a face that will remain free . if you then start the filter regulator , the area will remain free from rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it mir@@ r@@ oring or rotating into the right orientation . the tools can be mir@@ r@@ oring in the mar@@ riages or trans@@ forms .
photo bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture bub@@ bles and how you can find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm is used here , making here a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ers size change in menu and specify the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool to size change requires a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ous ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS label in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
adjust the aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio will be retained at the input of the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is related to larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it becomes more difficult , since it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons stores as and loading will be used exactly . each entry for the photo can be stored as text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
you can see below a sample for photo bub@@ bles by using a small paint image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
the cutting of a photos is not only a frequent operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . in order to cut a photo simply the rectangle with the mouse , through the mouse button and drag the rectangle , create . you will then see this rectangle over while you move the mouse .
when you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut out . by doing so , you can change a good overview as your photo after cutting . you can move the size of the cut area by drag the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle gives you up simply with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting machine , use the button The First @-@ button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save in the file to save the new cli@@ pped photo .
in the screening area you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will be retained .
in case of aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the greater value of the height is assigned and in the cross @-@ format width .
the tool after aspect ratio sets a relative aspect ratio . this means it is always equal , regardless of whether you are centi@@ meters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of dialogue there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or vertically .
down in dialogue , you can set the Max . proportion to the range of cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio sets the settings depending on the aspect @-@ orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you describe the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will be mir@@ ro@@ red and not the original pattern .
the settings of the coll@@ ations help enable help to put up your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ious triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle with similar triangles to the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division made on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the flo@@ wering leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things we can feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already by the old Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden graduation in all times when you put up your images , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is taken from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number is equal to 1 equal to 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition that is defined as a visual harmon@@ ic .
the golden center provides liquid assets available when you set up an image . these assist are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer results for your photos . compared to third @-@ level , the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual river on this type .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to len@@ ose the golden spiral . this may be a line of line or different objects . this can easily be because of its eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angle also refers to the top of the golden spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the center points of the sides of golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles make no equ@@ in@@ ous triangles . a diagonal to these lines can be filmed more dynamic .
if you want to break gold triangles in order to break your frame , you create an effect of professional Phot@@ ograph dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try your focus on one of the chi@@ ves and other visual information about triangles . the result is a very attractive , which you can not reach otherwise .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious particle .
with the button color , you can set the color of the help lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this type you can adapt the colour of lines to your current picture .
free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle .
if you do a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera up@@ set vertically and horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things can be rot@@ ated with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing and tool free rotation . select transform@@ ers Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button settings you can reset the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right above .
to help your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after reading a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to fix it is to use the function of transformation from the image processing .
a more elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option lets the image a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ ular transform@@ ations are performed for a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you must use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog , you will find some information which will help you change perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to right : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees to the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjust@@ ing the perspective the picture becomes somewhat slower . for individual adjustment is this effect small , but two adap@@ t@@ ations create a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after receiving the perspective , you get irre@@ plac@@ able tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to transfer this , it is the picture with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing from the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in a direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no turning , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectangle is dist@@ orted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer .
set your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time . if you press on default , the angle is set to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the show area .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your picture .
after completing the coating , the picture becomes a bit wei@@ rd . this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two bills are twice as much more bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shot , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the image with transform@@ ers trimm@@ ing from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images from your system and , in some cases , by the way such libraries are comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ ous ; edit .
due to this depen@@ dency on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all the available file formats on this site . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF on them .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; only shows files in formats known . this is done using file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed , you can change this list of file expansion . you can change this list for file expansion . in this configuration you can find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras do not even allow you to use format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression technique on digital images . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther outcomes than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free when this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful Tut@@ orials . in the section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; does the store of raw images only support with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ous ; all cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw form@@ ali@@ es taken by &amp; digi@@ ous ; supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording in short films . &amp; digi@@ ous video formats are often used in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but does not understand this formats , and is therefore no film processing program . if you click on a movie file , &amp; digi@@ ous ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings to play movies use the program to play playback .
go forward to the previous album of Chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you went back before .

all configured cameras are listed here . you can add the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please look for further information in the camera .
K@@ IP@@ I module includes a number of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you are doing the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good then you can carry out the first four Just@@ ings using the White Module .
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ous ; the description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft sign , noise de@@ pressed , ref@@ lex@@ us , etc . use a standardized dialogue type , which is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter on the current picture is applied . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture app@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current picture . links to him allow five buttons to change the comparison dus of the area . these modes are :
vertical sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left side shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the selected theme area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one displays the filter applied to the area below the selected theme area .
vertically sharing . the left section shows the original and the right to compare the filter &apos;s effect .
horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the show area , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ supply . the used colors can be adapted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for a selection of preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and look at the part of the image , from which you want to see di@@ e@@ preview . the link in the left section of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all entries from the last use of the module are indicated .
the page bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained to itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data , if these are available .
this rider makes an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button@@ ing to move a square . all images within this coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this requires naturally your pictures are ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and select colors of colours .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; either for the whole system or just one user will apply . in the latter case you are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color , and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or search the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palm view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a colour .
it shows the color below . the color is described under the palm view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a colour to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse with pushed lin@@ ker mou@@ st@@ aste .
if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted into the cur@@ sor position at cur@@ sor position . the color is either inserted or ski@@ pped another ; depending on whether the mode of over@@ write is selected . you can adjust this mode by choosing the check@@ box over@@ write under Bei@@ m cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was produced as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cut and inser@@ ts .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line mark if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a colour in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colors in the pal@@ let and the output of color selection can be drawn up with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then you can find on the left side on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graphics ; the programs , which &amp; graph@@ ically ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with only few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program to replace .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . graph@@ s and graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ically ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graphics in &amp; Kate ; displaying graph@@ s and embedded in &amp; graph@@ ically ; )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graph@@ s in &amp; graphic viewer ; to open a &amp; Kate ; component .
download large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than those no@@ des )
additional required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program that requires &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graph@@ s . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; graphic viewer , the main window is empty like in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list allowance are opened . Click on the first icon to open the dialog box .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot @-@ files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen photo :
as you can see , an overview will be displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse bike ( high and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right of pressing &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited to a factor of 10 in both directions . down below , you can see the maximum reduction in a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; graph@@ ically ; uploaded file from another program , the following window is displayed :
you can select whether the Gra@@ ph is to be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the changes . &amp; check your decision , so that later , you can change your decision later , you can set up the menu option k@@ ace ; set up , see also .
if you open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; -@@ instance , you want to open or want to be present in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as in the last option , you can save your choice permanent , but also change the setup dialog .
when the program starts , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last meeting again . once again , you can change your choice both save and later .
you can also set up how the graph will be divided into several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sides may be freely chosen .
if you use multiple sites , you can select whether the parts of the graph that will be mounted on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
side@@ ways look with one on several pages published graph@@ s without head line and another font
the site again stores the possibility to determine the behavior when a file is changed on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can design@@ ate a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore any changes ) or the program each time .
the site opens the possibility to determine the behavior of &amp; graphic viewers ; if a graph outside of an ongoing meeting is open . you can open a default behavior for this case ( see the graph in a new window or in a window of the current session ) , or determine that each time is asked .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and edit geographical data in the EX@@ IF @-@ sample of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize pictures geograph@@ ically in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordin@@ ate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itudinal and latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ seeing dialog appears then . in order to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains naturally data the same time recorded at the same places as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation was performed by the coordinates in red . GPS traces data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the time zone will be carried out with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the deviation for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper deviation for GPS time and camera duration . if the deviation is lower , the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds then cor@@ relate every pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS is located , you can set these boundaries here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have set a set of photos on the same location . since the dialogue itself the coordinates of a call to the next , you will only need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the loc@@ ating can also be found with the displayed map and can be found . select the following region and increase si@@ e.@@ Leadership to have achieved this once again . the amount must always be selected manually , and the card can be changed between card mode , satellite images , and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang up the GPS data . here &apos;s a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums and HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages compliant to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that can be exported to HTML pages . the character set will encoded UTF @-@ 8 to enable a best internation@@ alization .
the module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adjusted to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not set up hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ zo@@ schau and the text of the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider also defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is created largely self @-@ explained . if you then click on a picture a new page is displayed in the image below . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated pictures . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are explained by themselves .
the hor@@ semen set allows you some of the settings from the album rider for th@@ umb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user on how far the action is . press ab@@ rupt to break the process .
if the module creates the pages the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program reports to see if mistakes appear during production . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press closing around the module .

the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ator module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video like a slide .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ator module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically generated on the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the slide . with this module , it is possible to create formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the media .
first of all , you need to select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . afterwards , you can launch the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images selected from you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting photos or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be chosen from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds which is shown below . the speed of the picture process is set to below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth picture changes .
the background colour can be set as next . in doubt , you should make it black . you can set the name and the path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you add an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this is integrated into the film . after you have adapted all settings of your requirements , you can quickly drink a coffee at the speed of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can drink a coffee and drink the slide , if you are back .
if a hint appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adapt the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the right side down .
the print assist@@ ent allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper in standard photo @-@ sizes . this can also be done automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : sensible , to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module to direct print .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your images stored in RA@@ W format stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM or respectively .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that there are the same results as the software from your camera equipment . sometimes you &apos;ll get better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted , and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values re @-@ adjusted to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be adjusted for the white balance . the main parameters such as Gamma , Bri@@ ghtness and Red / Blue amp@@ lifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later .
a 4 @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contradiction information . if your camera works in RGB Mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal , and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a lower @-@ loss algorithm , and produces the smallest file sizes .
as well as image format , T@@ IFF , re@@ tains all the information of your picture and use the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W comp@@ ressing .
if you prefer to edit your pictures often or otherwise you should not use the JPEG format , as it only makes a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start with the trigger button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it .
the st@@ acking device mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. through testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures . however , here you have the opportunity to write an existing file automatically . this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion is prog@@ ressed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all pictures in an album . it uses the program to convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album should be used .
this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the image size from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can change the image size ( size ) or enlarge . in addition , four types of image change are available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the picture is automatically chosen , depending on the orientation orientation , chosen . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to custom@@ ize your picture to screen format .
not proportional : non proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed at this option .
pres@@ sur@@ ized : prepar@@ es the image for photo pressures . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo ap@@ sion@@ er . the target picture , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of additional images before . more pictures can draw on the list of visual images and place there .
after having started the module , the pictures window with which you anticip@@ ate your pre @-@ chosen images can be added . you can add some pictures above the button . for the last one @-@ chosen image , you &apos;ll see a preview on the right page .
you can also extract images on the picture list and add the images to the list of visual images .
the button images will be removed from the list of images that are removed from the list .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the New message -@@ window of your e @-@ mail clients . you &apos;ll need to add only the addresses and the subject . selected images are already attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to many images on once . most E @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails , if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and stored once again until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path to your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer before . you can download this here .
following the selection of comments in an attached file , comments are added to the images in a text file and attached the mail .
the P@@ NG format below the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss @-@ free formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in the JPEG format , then the original extru@@ dates will be added to the visual pictures .
when the process is ready , the window will not automatically shut down , you can view the status message , looking for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be automatically opened at the end . with the button switching , you can sh@@ lie this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , you will see a window with questions such as you want to see your slide . you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions in the presentation use very elegant image processes using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card since otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the option fil@@ en@@ ame ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually break with Es@@ c .
the option images acci@@ dentally choose that the pictures is shown in a random order , so the pictures of the pictures are used in the album .
delay between the pictures can be set the temp@@ oral distance between each pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds , and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so , you should show this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , you choose another effect between the pictures .
during the di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner around you .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide .
on the left lower screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module time &amp; date adjustment hasn &apos;t currently made any documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ . warning : the participants in this list speak English .

&amp; kiss@@ ing album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated into &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other than module available ( see ) . in the following section of the user name , the integrated version is written , which you can create files via the HTML @-@ file ... button .
before HTML pages , you have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area will be more precise .
first , enter the title of the super@@ script and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages , you can see an example of this settings .
next , select whether a &amp; master album will be created ; the export file is to be seen on the over@@ sight page . more information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML page . thus , you can avoid that information displayed on the HTML page . for example , see that all pictures of a party are obvious . at present all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use these settings to hide certain pictures from certain viewer .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most import@@ ation options are unique , which is why not specifically received .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . this allows those who have the view and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , no more pictures download , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewing of your site allows you to change the resolution at any time you have set . so , it can take your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he &apos;d like to see a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folders and the URL , where your website is stored .
best choose all your HTML files a base folder , and for each subsequent set a new fore@@ folder .
first you have to select the main folder , in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and next time you can choose the location . here you can choose either a folder or by K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check this really all for viewing . if you have created a URL , a web browser being created , the URL , which you specify here , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files are not yet in the final target folder you need to manually copy them . thus , the import function , see , right , you need to specify the final destination of the files , but the base folder in which all sub @-@ folders are located .
the just described sub@@ ordin@@ ation options are related to all three basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you set the output folder .
in case you are looking forward to a family party , meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; kiss@@ on album ; you can , of course , have a HTML page to look at the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; have a photo@@ album ; this work doesn &apos;t even make .
with &amp; delicious album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the pictures can be stored in the file or whether the pictures can be stored in the file , that you have all images together and to give this file so independent . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the menu Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the pictures of the URL you are searching for creating the HTML files . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following example , the dialog for Export images are described , which you can export via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . these three selection options are available :
in the manual setting up to .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file . copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most images have been compressed with JPEG image and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to , just select the export file format .
the last option of this page is limit the maximum image size . if you don &apos;t send your friends pictures , you would like to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can say that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import@@ ing ... select &amp; cra@@ cked album ; the exp@@ ort@@ alized database as described in described .
the wiz@@ ard to imports consists of four steps . first , you must select which pictures you would like to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you are using the category of person@@ alised file person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialog box , which are to be imported into the third dialog box , which are to be imported into your database .
in the fourth step you can see the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is visible on the picture .
it must be easy to brow@@ se pictures and look at : if you are looking at pictures , you want to view pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your boy@@ friend to discover , you may want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) searching and see to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today also takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual may be talked about pictures , but frequently closes these videos with one .
&amp; Win@@ ter album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup power tools , copying on a flo@@ ppy or revisions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; delicious album ; remember the folder , in which your images are stored and use this in future starts automatically . if you wish to read another folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , so you can start a file -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry settings on photo@@ album ; set up ... get to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you .
to the left you can see six different symbols , which allows you to view a preview of and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described in you how you can design@@ ate different properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
in view of the dialog , used to edit already existing groups . for each available group you can choose a labelling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialogue options , you can set up complete member groups , for example , all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a pan@@ gli@@ der .
in view , you can see the setup options available to you with the selection list . you can choose to configure the category . in the left window , you can see a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; Win@@ ter album ; its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ plug and g@@ ame@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . nour@@ ishing information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; their photo@@ album , but are not distributed separately . most modules , however , have a help @-@ page that you can call about the modules itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with the demo database before using the demo database before using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , making it possible to work some modules with &amp; master album ; this is the down@@ side when you share features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; the photo@@ album ; and other applications that can also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the album is simply a folder . even if &amp; delicious album ; this type of order does not support , it sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
here sim@@ ulates &amp; kiss@@ ing album ; the current album , which corresponds to the current view , all pictures depicting you at the moment at the moment .
next to the current album , &amp; photo@@ album has to be handed over ; the modules also handed over a list of albums . here &amp; on a photo@@ album , proceed as follows :
if &amp; have a photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be used the category that you have set up in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you are using the category of individuals , &amp; do so , so if you selected persons to view and do this with the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums are not compatible , you can remove these from the list of modules . launch the setup dialog , and select modules that are loaded modules .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen , once you start &amp; have a photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top of a menu and one tool bar . at the moment , you can &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in this section , we will show no information about your pictures . in this section , we will see a glance at the pictures show that shows you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to view any image with notes . this includes information about the people who have recorded on the picture , etc . you can set every image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if shown on all pictures Jes@@ per is illustrated and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in section . if you want , you can see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box , by clicking people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album , as you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the moving images within the list : if you have a family celebration , and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , therefore , that the used names are moved up , the people can find faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to see an ill@@ iter@@ ated list , click on the icon for sorting according to the list .
if you have selected notes on each image individually , you might still need to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes . Click this case simply to the front and back buttons that are located under the picture of the picture right .
if you have added multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu option more than once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to indicate that it is a transition , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Comment Yes , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also put an entry into a category and place there , in order to sort this entry into an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this sets out that you are currently alp@@ habe@@ tically sort your categories .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the Comment , by forming the bodies , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a private window by drag him out of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button choices , click on the button choices ... , which provides you among other things the opportunity to save the current structure and the look of the window .
you can also completely sque@@ eze out a frame . if you want to see this window later again , use the button ... and here window an / out @-@ out . you can see this process in the picture .
when you select the entry pictures in your browser , you will get an overview of the current selected images , or all pictures if you do not have filters . you can see the size of the images , by simply down pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply times .
if you make a picture on your desktop background , this image will be set up as background picture for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures from which you want to delete pictures from which you want to delete , and press either the removing button or select at the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; delicious album ; provides you for this issue a solution to you . you can also use photos stored on the hard disk . of course , you can also have the pictures anywhere , so you can record the pictures anywhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; the photo@@ album ; if not all the required images of the hard drive can be loaded .
pictures where the right corner cut off right corner is not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , see images 1 @-@ 9 , but for pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the show images are present , so that &amp; the photo@@ album you can view this pictures . however , you can &apos;t look at this pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see , this function does not need to copy files from the folders and to copy it again . so , if you don &apos;t want to avoid having to avoid the one in question your pictures , please do not buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to remain a little more privacy , you can view the pictures that you want to do for others , and click on the pictures that you may see your little sister , taxes and menu entry . everything else you can un@@ lock .
so you have set which pictures in the case of the font are supposed to be hidden . if you lock the laptop to your little sister , simply dial the menu entry pictures , which you will be locked out . if you want to see the pictures once again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into un@@ lock the pictures . to set up this password , select password change the menu .
please remember that this image protection is not very safe . for example , you can read or delete all pictures of the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this type of password protection is used only to those who are not familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to rever@@ b the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; delicious albums ; manage and spend hours over hours so that you want to look at some point . this is why you have a photo _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview , as described in .
the viewer you can see in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you &apos;ve got on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the top part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure them with the mouse , and you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
a few words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can set between them and return by using the buttons below high and image below . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as di@@ asch@@ au . then you can re@@ load a new picture after a few seconds . as often , a new picture can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and Plus respectively Min@@ us . started and stopped the slide through the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s contempl@@ ative tool ; it is possible to change in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer you can easily get out and zoom out into the image . with the Min@@ us button you can get out in the middle of the picture . showing how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ator , the zo@@ oms set the screen so that each pixel &apos;s pixel screen is equivalent to a pixel &apos;s screen .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations operate with videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the turn@@ out functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make comments on the current picture with the menu option comments from the context menu .
if you can view pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog box to enter these names . but you might prefer to draw the image only and look for more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and see them as well or bad , while you are looking for one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with traits , while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by doing so that you can press the corresponding letters . in case you see a picture in which features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can see them in your browser . so you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you &apos;ve selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want .
categories and special features can be shown in the preview of view . if you can view categories in D@@ re Pre@@ view preview , you can simply add features to the images by pressing the letter for the feature , after the image was chosen . you can see here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint on the picture .
the gem@@ m@@ ess is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can reverse your old @-@ old later .
in case you can see a painting on the painted picture . in order to place the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; click on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting just click on the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window .
to work with &amp; c@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; you have to control the use of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely control , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ al view yellow are shown .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an selected object , as all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object , click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple positions , the following open @-@ down menu will be built , so you can choose the correct position :
with extin@@ ction either from the menu bar , edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on users to adopt these changes . if you have not checked the invali@@ d values , you can report a message with a error message , then you can reset the input commands and reset the changes to ab@@ ort .
when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL @-@ user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
if you are editing a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview of your own @-@ wide view .
press preview in the self @-@ economic view and a small example of the scene is lo@@ oted with the selected texture . if you want to render a sub@@ lime item ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross it locally .
screen photo shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position of shifting . you can change the shift in line with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has an visibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to visibility or higher level . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visible point of visible level of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window layout as default . the object @-@ tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window layout , or if you need a different arrangement , you can also adjust it as well . you can also store multiple shut@@ ters and switch between different arrangements .
to fix a window via or underneath a view , head to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle is then showing the new position .
to create a new column , go to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view , extending over the entire height .
if you want to classi@@ fy several views in the middle of another view , you can then switch between the views by clicking on the maps world heading up in the views .
the last possible window settings are cli@@ cked views : views which are not embedded in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring point , head to your desktop , or click on the small pointing left uphill path in the summary bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the summary bar . to prevent the lock , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can easily fix them in any place .
the current window view can store up with view window settings ... store . there is a dialog displayed in which you can store the window layout under a existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be correctly installed . as this manual is written , it was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view .
a R@@ ender @-@ mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ ch a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full images in utmost quality .
when you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , click on the tool@@ bar or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog is opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets detect the properties of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered picture . if you want to ren@@ dering only one small area of the image , select the check box bottom section and enter the image section for ren@@ dering in the input fields .
in combination quality , you can select the properties that use &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . an exhau@@ sti@@ ve description of the R@@ ender properties will be found in the user guide book &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if an image with only one ray varies depending on pixel , various errors can be created . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in bends and lines , and sometimes details do not appear if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique used anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general , pictures with this property better .
if you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and combines &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray depending on pixel . this technique means super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling is adap@@ tive ; the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is further dissolved and adap@@ tive because each pixel is dependent on the calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray will pursue a beam ever pixel . if the difference between the values at the neighboring pixel , then both pixels are processed by a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values of red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference is divided between the values given the default threshold , then the pixel &apos;s pixel can be examined individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams does not have an object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console edition . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import , select the menu entry file import@@ ing ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Provi@@ ders ; not yet the complete command line of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if , when import@@ ing error reports or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , import this source context between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ at and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object @-@ tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code text in the Editor . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it to the object @-@ tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also add .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ed@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ dered ; usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the Help in the Own View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; looks for external files ( e.g. al@@ tim@@ bers ) into the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the file of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wireless models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the colour for control points . the second color is used for display the selected inspection points .
the colour of the rectangle stands for the visibility in the camera @-@ view and in the window @-@ type mark .
you can set the object @-@ catch of points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and rotation .
larger values result in a precise wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail amplifier for two directions .
if you cross high details fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further broken when the camera uses a extended projection . this feature gives a better rap@@ proch@@ ement for the projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross a wall , a wall is drawn behind the objects . the wall is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern in two adjustable colors .
when you indicate ground , a soil underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate the wiring , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes is set . values for depth and swelling could adjust you . precise data to the parameters you can see in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can modify existing shut@@ ters or create new window orders . in the window section , it is explained how to create and store window arrangements .
the Combin@@ ation box standard window layout : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window arrangements displays all existing window instructions . a new arrangement can add a button on the button and remove a select arrangement with the button .
any window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and cannot be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window layout . new views may add to the button adding and er@@ ase selected views using the button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you can create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with flaws , you can get a card postcard together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow any more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this manual , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a sphere at a level .
but you should consider the following war@@ nings , before you compl@@ ain that as a result , you can only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D programme for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for ren@@ dering is applied , as a result you will receive a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll get only a black image .
if you have everything faul@@ t@@ less installed , see the first Start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; the following pre @-@ installed window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate idea what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry editing . so you now have a scene without objects .
the open @-@ screen view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . this shows you the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties , where the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change anything on the fundamental settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change the camera in view of the camera , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired position .
when you press the button users or the input devices , the wire model views and the object @-@ tree change immediately to these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the view of the camera here .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might include a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert End@@ less Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an easy method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; in fact , it offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the plane in the object @-@ tree , change the name and then press the button users or the surgery . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the open @-@ circuit diagram now shows the plane , though at the moment only as limited end@@ able level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you view the object @-@ tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can see the entry for the bottom . in this case , you will see the various parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for any new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should shift the ground to the exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to insert its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but select something single in the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue that you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the object of the object . you can change the name in the object @-@ tree view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview can you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a strong black material because you can add settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way now .
if you don &apos;t look any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results :
of course , you are not the Far@@ ben@@ z . here you have to set two new attributes . in the list list , you have to select two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the box colour list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object @-@ tree , select and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should be easily done as you can already handle the basic functions of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; the ball rot@@ ates just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the Settings or button use ) , so the ball would floating on the ground because you moved the ground around a unit down@@ wards .
naturally , the Ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as before , the ball @-@ surface looks like a matte black material . put the next step a suitable material .
if you selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . as already on the floor , type the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select the principle and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . Click on the pig@@ ment , select input and adjust the values as follows :
but you can achieve interesting effects if you take time to insert some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection result already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : still not chosen :
you should have a good impression of that which features you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; hopefully , you have learned something so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ ew@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ews the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender is calculated , like this beam will be reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects like a fog can effect . so the scene is processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see any camera without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source , see also nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be lo@@ oted , some light sources and at least one camera .
in common file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you have to enter a name and a storage space .
shows the scene again stored in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t even have stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu entry if you are using Edit Re@@ aches .
stores the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or enter a existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the look , the keys and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to modify the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands with this option to default for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; -@@ commands or new .
opens a dialog to set up the tool bar . you can add and remove the tool@@ chain for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; add commands and remove orders .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is an option to remove rough surfaces , without any hi@@ ves to be model@@ ed separately on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these principles . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as a colour card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient picture viewing and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display .
pictures can be displayed in either a window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ k show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or the button Return .
you can adjust whether each image is displayed in a window , or if all images are supposed to use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
set up in the dialogue - &amp; ku@@ k show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and Sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the mode of operation &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the keys for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour that you can set up below . default is not a full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , loads &amp; ku@@ k show ; already the next image in folder , while you can even look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ k show ; at the end of the last open folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ k show ; this folder in the browser window .
Click on the coloured beam to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , here the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ k show ; to set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also represent the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is switched to default .
specify whether the sli@@ deshow starts with the first image in folder or with the selected image .
the time span between screen change at a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field , or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field , or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change here the key@@ codes for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ k show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for display windows and short commands for the browser .
with this option switch between the second @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays great icons for files in folder . this ad is only possible in short notice .
displays small symbols for files in folder . this ad is only possible in short notice .
displays examples for files in folder . this ad is only possible in short notice .

the picture increases by 10 % . the factor rel@@ ates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open .
shown the image in original size . this is only convenient if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo processing based on the &amp; digi@@ ous ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ ous ; project .
&amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user reports its part to have at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show photo ; makes it easy to report any mistakes or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu includes a message with a link . if you are using this , your browser doesn &apos;t open a page to the reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are able to help each other . if you &apos;re using a more common users of &amp; show@@ photo ; then , we want to answer any questions on other users of &amp; show photo ; however , hopefully soon even questions other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; it is the developer &apos;s mailing list to join . guide to the developer &apos;s mailing list by &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options to access these settings . you can set up in 8 pages in the menu settings . you can change between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that will be displayed if the lower or over@@ exposed stress dict@@ ator should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colours with what you want to display , in contrast . under@@ supply should display a dark colour and over@@ exposed a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; possesses a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more to sc@@ anned and de@@ en@@ rich .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and en@@ rich images that do not make more than images to scan and en@@ rich . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving , or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before you save .
you can check the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project page by checking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ Pro@@ ject@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command count -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , then a dialog box is opened to selecting the scanner .
the user can select the use of the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; cra@@ w@@ l@@ ite ; end .
the further settings contain more detailed options for the driver . &amp; cra@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
in order to add an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ for@@ c@@ can and then scan scanning for the final scan . the Pre@@ face can be launched through the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can adjust the zoom so you can adjust the complete preview into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview display in the settings , then the picture will be shown in a preview window that is shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sh@@ lie ? en leads to a quar@@ ry and you &apos;ll get back to the main window .
through the button settings , the same name is open before the main window . you can change here the most important settings .
users can see the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way how &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can select . dialogue for saving each image open the dialog before each one @-@ called image . if &amp; sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically sets up with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must save saving without any fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the pictures are stored in the option save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... Change
this parameter is defined by a picture pre@@ fix for the image to save images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialogue to save . the automatically stored picture will receive a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of any time , when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing may be used to end &amp; scan .

you may convert existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ short commands . therefore , make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ arok ; Control Centre .
the D@@ COP interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions to be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts , and is intended to describe the d@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function break might be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok is supporting the command lines of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE . additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command lines options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and use dialog , so that user may know why a script does not run .
the require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binary for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in scripts / Tem@@ plate you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as basis for your own scripts or simply extend the necessary functions . they will quickly determine that scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the output of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually used to be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simple . here , an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends messages to all current scripts . this is why scripts should monitor their default input and respond appropri@@ ately to events . of course , a script may also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store the store and loading of setup data each script will take care of . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the work folder on the folder , where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is shot . the script might now de@@ b &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information on the new piece ( for example , met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize the path to the selected files of the play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry may also be used to use the script file d@@ co@@ p am@@ eli@@ script add@@ al@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mov@@ es@@ em@@ Title &#93; can be used . in order to remove a entry , d@@ co@@ p am@@ eli@@ script re@@
before &amp; am@@ arok ; it ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to do the spatial works . for example , the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages , which can be compressed by a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . for example , users can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok &apos;s script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ oc@@ script . this is why you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main thing must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining memory modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can charge it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Wik@@ i scripts website of &amp; am@@ arok ; for your entry to K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the am@@ arok category ; scripts .

&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you must have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs contained , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small manual , how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimum .
some functions such as the O@@ SD are predic@@ ting that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , but therefore , Flu@@ x@@ box will prepare for example . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , hence , we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files creates a bug in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can check the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / apps / apps / am@@ arok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang the cap@@ ute file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
if you mostly hear Tag@@ li@@ b in reading the met@@ a @-@ information from that file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ arok ; is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ arok ; used libraries to comp@@ ile with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able automatic up if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least not a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if it is a frequent down@@ fall , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be solved .
this is due to the fact that many program files are writing as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ information , but this is not known as Unicode file . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / restart / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) are always available in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . you can see the status disabled to grey and semi transparent . note that in some cases , you can click on a icon until this setting shows its effect .

after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; only a blank play@@ list is released . how do you come there for music there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to stop the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window is converted into the statistic window . you &apos;ll find it at ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate the pieces , the evaluation box must be displayed in the play@@ list . Click on the title bar of the play@@ list and select column for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then sque@@ eze on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection , then choose from play@@ list from the down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let it fall there , just as you would do with other files . so easy is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of play@@ list , right next to the Add button , the button is back @-@ play@@ list . Click on it .
presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . look at the lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
the Equali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras .
no . yes , this really is ! no ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question are Which media types support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support so pretty every only possible audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even code text and P@@ NG !
it can ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default no MP3 decoder is provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , Alp@@ habetical

if you use the G@@ dri@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must be able to use a bl@@ ender . it allows for several applications to use the device at the same time and run simultaneously . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software @-@ Mixer ) . check the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may have to specify another sink ( e.g. pav@@ illon ) .
this does not do so . don &apos;t forget to send the media first . you can &apos;t just listen to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the best choice if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS automatically de@@ codes the data first . G@@ spre@@ amer can spend right onto AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ tim@@ acy ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs , which may cause to cause playback . read this bug report . the En@@ large Sound @-@ Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts driver , instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ multimedia to get all the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ c , etc ; ) .
probably you will use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts @-@ buffer in the Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , the less s@@ lugg@@ ish react the visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ yp@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to G@@ yp@@ amer &apos;s drivers , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . perform G@@ ST register , to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ rowing FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - shop you download , comp@@ ile and install it . then run G@@ ST register , once as system administ@@ rators and once as your normal user . then delete the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ lim@@ mer @-@ config ( s ) and run G@@ ST register once again . now start &amp; am@@ p .

put the CD , then click the menu on Audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal evaluation , select a few pieces and pull them in the desired target folder in a tap@@ quer@@ or window . instead , use files from folder mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically this is the previous assessment with a decl@@ ining value , based on how often the piece has been played , the less influence has any individual assessment on the overall result .
you can insert the evaluation of a piece by yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column @-@ title in the play@@ list window . then , you can select the evaluation of a piece on the piece and edit : select or press rating . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialogue met@@ ad@@ ata .
the developers don &apos;t want to tell you when you should release a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that did not bring together with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest versions available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crash@@ es and thus caused a lot of error reports .
presumably was &amp; am@@ arok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stra@@ amer . thus , the / configure routine did not comp@@ ile this output modules . you have to configure &amp; install .
now I have &amp; am@@ arok ; new installed , but the output modules will not appear yet . and now ?
presumably you will use a distribution that is installing the development files from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary devel@@ opped files are missing . you must now install the package stre@@ amer @-@ dev@@ el . then you need to install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . afterwards , you have to re@@ comp@@ ile and install again .

specify in setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , dis@@ able the sound card using sound card .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be cared for . you may naturally have this problem to take care of your own ! if you want , you can call the new so badly needed coach for Arts : )
music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is an alignment assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; am@@ arok ; if you don &apos;t like your collection , you should be able to help your collection . by your help you are &amp; am@@ arok ; in a few minutes you will have set up .
the creation of a play@@ list is very easy . drag along with the mouse entries to the play@@ list . if you are satisfied with the play@@ list , you can easily store the remaining entries . if you are satisfied with the play@@ list , you can easily store them with the Help button . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add these play@@ list to add to your collection . if the play@@ list is enabled in the folders of your collection , then you &apos;ll find the play@@ list for import@@ ing play@@ lists . with a right @-@ click on a play@@ list , you will get various possibilities as the play@@ list will be loaded .
to play an audio CD , select audio CD in the menu bar . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files to the play@@ list and press the button playback .

&amp; am@@ arok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . in addition , &amp; am@@ arok ; a player window with most important functions . in addition , &amp; am@@ arok ; a play@@ list includes several brow@@ sers , where you can capture and brow@@ se your entire music collection .
in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ arok branches are used ; including the creation of a collection and a play@@ list .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ arok ; control centre . at the top edge of the window is a running text display , which is currently displaying the current running piece or the current stream . just below is the area , the time , bit@@ rate and sample rate of current play . Click on this area changes the already past season to play the remaining season of the play .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text indication . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ arok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard , and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running text display , the buttons PL and E@@ Q are activated , or the button PL is activated , or dis@@ ables the play@@ list window , while the button E@@ Q is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player @-@ window consists of the reproduction buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ p@@ eg@@ ler to insert the piece or volume . with playback buttons , you can start playing / stop and change to the next or previous one .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio tracks . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Klassik to Techno , and you can create very own default settings .
to preview the Equali@@ zer you will use ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the button e@@ Q in the player window . once you mark the check box E@@ Q , the Equali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; am@@ arok ; is the most advanced play@@ list of all for &amp; K@@ DE ; available multimedia player . it has many features that exist in no other players . but do not allow the abundance of functions not deter them , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be shared into two main sections , on the left side is the navigation range . in the navigation area you can find some of the excellent features of play@@ list , such as the context @-@ list itself . on the right @-@ hand side is the play@@ list itself . but the play@@ list is easy to use and nonetheless , even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser shows different information regarding the current production . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three bottom windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . these three bottom windows are still in detail more detail . you provide information on the ongoing piece of each different aspects .
if you already have earlier versions of &amp; am@@ arok ; perhaps , you may have noticed that the bottom window is gone . the information presented here are now been distributed to other parts of &amp; am@@ arok ; in addition , information can be collected in the statistics window ( ex@@ tras ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the straight piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window shows information on the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , interpre@@ t and the album . among them see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . Click on this icon to suggest the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . see here how often and when the piece was played on the first and last time , as well as its evaluation .
to preview cover images in the context browser , the cover images are available in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are preferred . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images that were downloaded either with the cover management or in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next field , Recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this area displays the five most rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ters .
you can adjust the information displayed in the music file window . Click on with the right mouse button anywhere in the bottom window , and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpre@@ ters which you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you &apos;ll see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the single areas to start playing with playback . you can also click on the right mouse button and then select from the context menu one of the options to add the piece or Alb@@ ums to the play@@ list .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text for the current piece is displayed . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text code text by yourself , trying to download the text for the piece using the Internet . if no text @-@ script is running , you can choose which should be started .
the button Edit enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ arok ; s collection database is stored . there is no running text script necessary .
the button search opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com based on the song lyrics for running ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only the top level , each piece is displayed next to the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are left out besides eight .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first the pieces are arranged according to interpre@@ t and , among them , another split after the particular album is made . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track records , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed on the beginning of the list below different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ter to Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alp@@ habe@@ tically listed among each other . the interpre@@ t will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them according to interpre@@ t .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t / album - this setting works as well as the above , but will also be sorted into the album below the interpre@@ ts .
with the help of remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing fully to exposure and combine them .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ arok ; will enter your collection automatically as soon as you own something about the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool bar is a search engine . it is in the list of list as well as in the supervision of the list . references to the use of this filter are available in the play@@ list in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time window , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . furthermore , you can also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
charging - This is the current play@@ list and add the selected pieces in the current order to play .
attached to play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ click on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ es - this function adds the selected pieces into the queu@@ e long . thus , you will be played as next .
when the play@@ list is back ... - Save the selected pieces as a play@@ list . you are asked by a name , under which the list is supposed to be stored .
to transfer media player - Add the pieces into the queu@@ e for transfer to the media player . more details are available in the section about the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpre@@ ters burn / burn it on CD - let the selected pieces be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
met@@ ad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) post@@ p@@ one files in the rub@@ b@@ ish ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm that , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation , marking the selected album as a compilation , as well as the different interpre@@ ters appear .
raise the compilation of the compilation - changes the marked album back into a normal album . after that , the album is no longer shown below the different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ters .
the play@@ list browser is easy to use with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these utili@@ ze &amp; am@@ arok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists to the run time . the intelligent play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection , which were never played .
even self @-@ built @-@ play@@ lists are also possible . Click on the Intelligent play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new intellec@@ t . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ arok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) , it must be mounted before the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; started , you can sort the pieces on your iPod to interpre@@ t in the top listing of the media player brow@@ sers .
to transfer pieces on your iPod , drag the desired title from the play@@ list and release it on the list of interpre@@ t . if you are finished , click on your iPod . if the transmission is completed , exit &amp; am@@ arok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you can find a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden , which are not related to your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar where you can enter music from a given URL . if you are using tar : / home / Mike / musical .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z , you can go to music in the music file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there into the play@@ list .
when the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the att@@ aching of files can be very difficult . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key may be helpful : thereby f@@ law@@ ed files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , not at the end position .
the play@@ list contains all of you for playing . you can change the order by adding the entries simply by the mouse to the desired position . once you enter the letter , you &apos;ll find only the pieces that you may include . to reset the filter , press the button again until the text box is again empty .
if you enter by space @-@ separated search terms , is &amp; am@@ arok ; according to entries , search all search terms . if you enter two three , the search will find all entries , which contain one , two and three .
for entries , if you are searching for entries , select either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces will be found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , the spaces include , then re@@ connect the search with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . thus , according to entries , the Mike Old@@ field is included , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search engine , you can also look for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 This is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece , which does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something search for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ dro@@ id variations after you . example : Mike Old@@ field OR Cor@@ score : &gt; 50 comment : bath . this is searching for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating as 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the query sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order . entries will then get a lab@@ eling with number . number equals the sequence in which the pieces will be returned .
the tool bar of the play@@ list is located at the lower edge of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the play@@ list . on the left , you can add the button adding that you can save the play@@ list . on the right , you &apos;ll find play@@ list stored , play@@ list empty and Rand@@ om@@ less mixing .
next , the buttons are revers@@ ed and restore . so , you can reset , or restore changes to the play@@ list .
in the middle of the tool bar , there is a unique , enlarged analysis . the refresh@@ er rate can be set to the analy@@ zer with a click of the right mouse button .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the Player window on the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos; s Con@@ figuration .
there are still many more available buttons for the tool bar , for example , playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and select tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the play@@ list . it shows the title of current pieces , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and re @-@ catch is easy to change by clicking with the mouse double in the corresponding display area .
you can also turn off the status bar . for this purpose , activate the option status bar in general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with a click on the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list menu . by this menu you can reach the Settings &amp; am@@ arok Settings menu .
Click on this entry to the window visu@@ alization @-@ plug@@ ins . you can select the visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations of &amp; am@@ arok .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information at &amp; am@@ arok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can launch them by selecting action cover management in our collection browser .
the cover management includes a list of list of all albums in your collection . you can consider all the albums of one artist in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ t on the left side .
with the menu view , you can choose which should be displayed in the cover management . select from :
the queu@@ e administration received your big entry into &amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have set more control over the play@@ list . once you have set a piece in queu@@ e , it appears in the play@@ list , the order in which &amp; am@@ arok ; the pieces will be played at first : 1 will be played first , 2 as a second , and so on .
the management of queu@@ e open over ex@@ tras waiting long administration . if you want to add a piece in the play@@ list and then click on + . you can also add the pieces in the play@@ list , or use the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of pieces can then change in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details to set up this follow later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during playback .
insert pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : audio @-@ Robot ) . this mode requires that already some pieces are in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile that this dynamic play@@ list works .
Click on the desired play@@ list , drag them to the play@@ list window , or click with the right mouse button on you and then select loading . in this way your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new , so you should save the old play@@ list under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di acci@@ dental mix and play@@ list mix immediately fill up your play@@ list and you can add to at least one piece of your collection . the recommended plays are added at least one piece of your collection , therefore your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first denom@@ inations .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will be able to use your existing play@@ list as starting point . via the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled once again .
the button New pour the current play@@ list and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . play@@ list will open the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the opportunity to click Edit . then the dialog box will open to edit the play@@ list .
enter here any name for play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this adjustment is not active , your play@@ list will grow continuously , the setting for forth@@ coming connections will not be heard . if the attitude is active , the already played pieces will be removed below the resp@@ ecting the attitude .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played , which are to be kept at the beginning of the play@@ list . this allows you to easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to each play@@ list . if you set up here more than 1 , then the play@@ list will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , it is going to add &amp; am@@ arok ; random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts allow their own settings . you can adjust the settings by clicking the script and then click on .
you can install new &amp; am@@ arok ; scripts to install on the script . once you have installed the script , you will install a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . you can also download new scripts directly from the internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select the script then click to install .
if you are looking for information on writing own scripts , please look in the writing of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ ali@@ zer plug @-@ ins will be used to activate the available visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations in &amp; am@@ arok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , just activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide is to show you how to create a audio CD in four steps . in order to re@@ produce the steps , you must have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window , where you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you would like to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ worn compressed formats , you think that you can get a worse quality while using an audio CD , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you may test whether a Audio CD has been created by any los@@ s@@ less format . do not use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
this quick guide is to show you how to copy &amp; c@@ 3@@ b ; you can copy a data CD in just four steps . in order to re@@ produce the steps , you have to put in a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted the quant@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .

V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully @-@ featured vendor system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
standardized : this tool becomes custom@@ ary to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it may be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections without norm@@ alize the different ap@@ le@@ tics of different albums for the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces will be re@@ produced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small lin@@ ux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re @-@ opened projects recently . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . Click on an entry brings the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise the new file name is asked .
stores the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog box below is displayed , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you &apos;d set up for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project is changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between Save and Chang@@ es . moreover , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each stored project , what to happen to it as would you have called for each project file shi@@ fted .
includes all open projects and finishes &amp; cle@@ 3@@ b ; . for each of the stored project , we asked what to happen if you &apos;d called on the file .
when you record this entry , you can select the published dialog files to add to the project . this is the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog for the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . burning of burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project related settings . any project type has different potential settings , most of them are described above what is this ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you &apos;re using files for a multi @-@ review CD . this is useful if you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files existing in the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only in an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature makes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only bl@@ ends the previously imported files .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows copying a CD to any other medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer to copy cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows copying a DVD to any other medium . alternatively , you can only do a copy of a DVD instead of normal copy . moreover , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue is not yet supported , therefore the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
open the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . using this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , allows you to write the choice between writing modes and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously made CD image . the dialog can be burned after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously invented DVD image . the dialog will prompt you after an * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can be burned instantly by pressing the burning button .
a previously sour@@ ced DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window usually appears after the reading of a DVD in the ingredients , but can also be used as listed below . it contains information about the exquisite video , code settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if one entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently displayed in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is blin@@ ded .
switches the folder view or off . the folder view is an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , the content will appear in the content list . CD / DVD drives have also displayed a context menu with functions such as media information , blocking and un@@ lock the drive or exp@@ eller of the media .
switches the ingredients a or off . the content view allows selecting and pulling files into the projection screen . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head bar in the projec@@ tile is a narrow@@ er area , which is only visible when the projec@@ tile is open to open projects . the head@@ lamps has no real function , it looks pretty pretty and divi@@ des the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog box for modi@@ fying the key assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key to the key below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b , execution assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administ@@ rators need to be required . therefore , you must enter the password for the system administ@@ rators ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can make general programs settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is designed for person@@ alise and adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also , with one &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a switch script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical , therefore , rather your taste and the way of your task is crucial , which will give you the enclosed programs .
in this chapter we assume that you are using the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use it , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then , enter something like the following on the console :
next to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the Standard D@@ COP interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Media Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ Project ( ) : copy@@ re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ Project ( ) : copy@@ re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mod@@ Project ( ) , copy@@ righ@@ t@@ D@@ vd ( ) , bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( ) , bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ) .
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can generate a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
a cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) , add@@ ur@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Quart@@ u ) , add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ String Quart@@ or , Q@@ String path ) , ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) and set@@ list ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple file , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creamy Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT simply / home / tru@@ ck@@ .@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; choice for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it can be easily read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder of the machine installed on the computer .
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the output of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many Ko@@ di@@ ers who are using these WAV files ( compression @-@ free compression ) . currently , lame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) are still to be added ( if you have been installed ) .
first , the Title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per titles ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , the output of the &amp; CD , it is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other coding are already present . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile yourself . however , if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is not necessary .
what code readers / file format should be used ? the Chapter World Water Ko@@ di@@ ers provides a small introduction about coding , audio quality and comp@@ ressing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is designed to read any copy protection . if not the firmware version of the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection ; even not the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid simply the purchase of head @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , is explained after daily handling of a &amp; CD . this leads to the hard disk approach of the user interface , which you will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ DB file or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is only a short list of commands of the main character . on the page step for step example , you will find further information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the maps for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the CD@@ DB registration card . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must be made . )
begin to read and - when an encoder is configured in the Ko@@ di@@ fication Settings tab , which is configured as coding .
opens up a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection with another encoder can be read than the standard . it is necessary to consider that prior to the encoder , configured in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that a already sour@@ ced file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD .
opens the setup dialog for programming noti@@ fications ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different cards ( such as encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here , you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding , compression rates , and helps you to choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acou@@ stical model , MP3 and OGG is the most common . OGG makes today a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important since both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame will nevertheless supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rate ) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a machine @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG cutting devices is present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these tools usually support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters on the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 up to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good sound for music by adolescents , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is ex@@ agger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are entered manually or by the program automatically retri@@ eved from the Free@@ DB file , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of programming settings for the code and these parameters here . the manual or help to the code explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the sample rate ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt &gt; lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ah must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identification in the wiz@@ ard ) :
that &apos;s what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download / enter the information , so that all others can download this information instead of itself in the computer . it is necessary to note that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( an@@ x@@ fran@@ ce of the translation ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less valuable , so neither can neither the artist nor the music company damage . any information can be obtained at a B@@ umm@@ el by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; for use of Free@@ DB can be attached to a check box . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from server ( This can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; check box ; for use of Free@@ DB , the geographical closest to the next mirror server will be needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the burden between machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of reflec@@ tions for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created per month ) only the updating of the database .
which code program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; for those who want to know more precisely , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to be aware that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this is not yet happened .
to store the file format WAV files , the code can be selected and thus the desired file format . during the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free comp@@ ressing for audio data ) can be added to the address of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other enco@@ ders may be added to this tab .
the code package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the code may be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined Ko@@ di@@ ers . further information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the Chapter World Code .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switch through the input of a command such lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . &apos; lame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed coding .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device number of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the write and reading of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed .
there is a chapter by step example . even if you use different settings , you can give the tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but is somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample rate ( tags ) .
there have to be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be found as a compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not totally free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory / us@@ r / share / cd is and that you own write permission ( eg ; by copying something into the cross @-@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something probably being done just once and
the second section describes the presentation of a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we define the used code compression in compression ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with the Free@@ DB to download and download the file from the internet .
even though we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with each reading of a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device model is given to the program code so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device number of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt to contain the existing entries of the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives .
the card General Settings . here you can not do much . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is om@@ itted / entered as shown in screen photo .
only in case of incomplete information please select that you will be informed when data are missing ( tags ) .
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD automatically download the Internet from a Free@@ DB machine .
note : this calcul@@ ator must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the Free@@ DB server .
the second sel@@ ector is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately if you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , it can be easily changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed using the directory entry and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from that example , if you want to manually type all manually in the offline mode , you can download the selection fields and Free@@ DB will not be used . however , if you are using Free@@ DB in off @-@ line mode , you &apos;ll need to select whether you have to select Free@@ DB in off mode . if you want to select Free@@ DB in off mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following box card .
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are att@@ itudes for the data en@@ quiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the Free@@ DB server via the internet . how does the system which data should get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . put everything in as shown in the screenshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the site free server and look to a mirror server in your vicinity . on this road the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
they both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls operate the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there may be more fortunate with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf in the internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want &amp; CD to transmit data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box is to be checked .
simply take the settings from the screen photo . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous tunes : ap@@ ologies , there is a reason why more than one at the same time , using only a existing drive ? parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author does not know , therefore , try to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece , put this on around the &amp; CD ; to throw at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you cross it , then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored . this can &apos;t be fixed if only space on another drive is available . do not forget the files in private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files .
everything can be done as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something must be flo@@ ated to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as already stated before , it is sufficient to offer a very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting rate of bit@@ rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this reached the compression factor 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted as desired . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of later changes of tags . % f and % are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous wav @-@ files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic set of &amp; audio . finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section it is described as the process of choice of the &amp; CD . it is described in the previous section and furnished . first , a connection to the Internet is built , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ DB can be arranged . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in Free@@ DB , see the screen photos a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully completed Free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually instead of retri@@ eve them from the Internet . comments are pointing to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD now must be entered into the drive which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be found in the window , as in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , search in section Questions and Ans@@ wers after the assistance , or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
caution : if the &amp; CD won &apos;t be picked up from the Free@@ DB , all tracks are already filled out and in addition , the artist &apos;s name and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for automatic query from Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually fix it by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you can pick up the data from the internet , you will need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor , entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; accordingly to the pattern on the next screen photo . title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Updated title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; Update &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments . the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful recall of the data from the Free@@ DB is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen photo . however , it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( for example , if all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to prove if there is any un@@ wanted comments .
please note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , this option will be set up at the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ero Settings menu ; take a look inside the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later , with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see Help to Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
simply dial one entry , which is obviously not important with the style of the per@@ imeter CD ; this example is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information , please visit the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the selected data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece definitely will be any case and other information you wish .
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way up to all the cover data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and album are displayed on the play list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles can be selected or out . make sure that all the items are selected , or select the button all pieces of the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
was launched by clicking on the button Select , then this window appears to confirm . OK , and then we will take a look at the window with the contracts and track what is going on .
Click on orders to turn off on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right beneath the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window at the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ eter you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece .
assignment # 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the code of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . this will be read out and coding . please note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the result is un@@ clear . the used machine used with an am@@ d@@ 64 seems no problem when reading and en@@ code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is coded and a third order in the queu@@ e is on . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. respectively 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; will be done today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CVS as part of the Con@@ dem@@ ise media package . however , if you &apos;re talking with CVS , you can already get a compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ 2 ; a part of a key &amp; K@@ DE ; package is part of your distribution package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is directed to persons who comp@@ ile from source files , and not for users who use a compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance , as the program can be adjusted to suit your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step for step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments on options which are not used in the example .
hello , still alive ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked off after the first time of the program , without any reference point it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
how about this ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can &apos;t record this manual . it is meant as the first version for a manual and change . if you always want to add something useful or change , it may do . at least first after contact with the author . and if you read this section , it is mis@@ understood this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion .
strange when you managed to get the source file from the &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; K@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others , he has also some features that do not have some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players .
&amp; mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS System , so on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support the &amp; Linux ; an Ultr@@ asound project driver supported for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included once it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer .
&amp; mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing colour , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel when using the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you &apos;re in &amp; K@@ DE ; every MIDI file from a &amp; tap@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can put on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( file events or textile events ) . K@@ mid is automatically calculated using the procedure used .
seat support . if you complete &amp; K@@ DE ; during the departure of a song , K@@ mid will start again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu , select the usual File dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also convert a file from a &amp; tap@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; c@@ mid ; windows drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and play the button shooting in the tool bar , select the entry to play from the menu piece or check out the space bar .
please note that &amp; c@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you move it to the &amp; c@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is play@@ able , you can jump in any place by using the medium mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and drive .
when you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows left and right the speed display . to get the original temp@@ o again , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the bar is acting as a pressure on the button , or the select menu entry in menu piece , thus inter@@ rup@@ ts playing . do the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text incl@@ ines , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; mid ; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected to enable a song manually , so you will automatically select the kar@@ aoke text . but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to adjust a type of event , select from the menu settings and the entries of the text messages or windows . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in the series , in this section as you can use collections efficiently .
to set up a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point organis@@ ing .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the cho@@ osen in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when adding the application , this collection will not be stored . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you must add to the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button adding . it appears in turn to the file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Autom@@ atically to the collection .
if Autom@@ atically is activated for the collection , a piece is automatically added to the opening ( using File Transfer or drag &amp; drop ) to the active collection .
if Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the sequence in which the songs can be played . if you select the row after the sub @-@ menu of the menu collections , songs in the order will be played as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the button on the right .
to jump back a song , select the button &quot; previous piece , the previous piece from the menu or press the button on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; c@@ mid ; not stored .
this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General @-@ MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI events in events that understands the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano in the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus plays a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all the necessary changes for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may seem as often as desired . pre@@ mise for this is , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the key@@ map &quot; ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... End Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can provide in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; can provide support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all sounds that need this instrument on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not sufficient for example ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , you can see a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . do not wear the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if so now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( v@@ ying ) , patch is 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound in the MIDI file stands .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which each note is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means tone the pitch of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds can be displayed on a certain channel or instrument . use is :
like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines are very important , so their presence . you must therefore create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ holes for each channel and any instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sounds on the per@@ imeter channel . look for example the provided Key@@ maps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , you simply make it simply at the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built following the following pattern :
n is here the channel that is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the corresponding key map needs to be defined on the front in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored if you try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example , to always use the perme@@ able patch on the per@@ k@@ ype channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der ratio can be multiplied by the ratio of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events . if therefore , a MIDI file is converted to the value of n , this will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 4096 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 4096 is used so that in the map file does not dec@@ imal ( dec@@ imal come ) .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch , a sound higher with the value 4096 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards can play up to one oc@@ tave above . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; c@@ mid ; try a try .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu , Settings , point MIDI settings
the canal view is a window with a whole series of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ res you see which sounds just played .
you can also use the can@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can use an instrument , the button is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to indicate the played sounds . view from the menu settings under the point Channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed at which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow down to change the temp@@ o , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music is needed . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways .
OK , I can never force to use &amp; c@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs about 50 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer get a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; they have control over everything .
that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; c@@ mid ; it happens because &amp; c@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to solve the problem you must download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a complete folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree that supports &amp; drop ; drag &amp; drop . open just the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
to add previously the setup automation add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can select the arrow key to the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the play . to restore the standard temp@@ o , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I &apos;ve been on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Play a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this screen , I need to play a MIDI file or if I want to play a file , just into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; windows change and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting Autom@@ atically to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening of Files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ I.@@ d. first you want to play the first file . so , set the setting Autom@@ atically at the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains then exactly this one MIDI file .
then you dis@@ connect , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do it ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard shows me feel it on &amp; mid ; to program .

my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us Sanchez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing of AW@@ E support , Has P@@ etter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error message or only a supp@@ or@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the web , which gives us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , it can also be found on his homepage , which is located at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can see the development , look and look at links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a sound card or external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; G@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL ; it then runs as if you would like a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if difficulties pers@@ ist , please contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed for playing video files of the players or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; wasn &apos;t finished yet as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new releases , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there &apos;s always the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information panel , which will only be displayed if there is information in it .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connection under the menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played after each other , you should use the category of continuous play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archy . if you balance a record , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list can also be changed through direct editing XML / .@@ k@@ de / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category . simply click on a name of a category . by clicking on a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you must be selected from the menu to play@@ list and select either the Edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing mode or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during boot and end can be disabled by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ f and modify ( General Op@@ tions &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ taining option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / apps / k@@ m@@ player / trans@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during boot doesn &apos;t need short , it will be automatically terminated by opening a different source . this would be distur@@ bing in the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
an easy example of a start animation can be advertis@@ ements ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = &quot; in@@ ce &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; gt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; B / body@@ gt ; * / s ; in directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL is supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition to the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ fully . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in play@@ list XML .
to use the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash needs to be specified in the setup dialog type K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if no error occur here , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so always a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ fully . for example , ph@@ one@@ on must play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs a k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) before TV can be configured to use the device and TV channels . for this purpose , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video Data Recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog box below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port to use . there should be ports to be found . the correct code must be found ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably included a DVB in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this kind of playing of video devices amongst Linux is the only that works ) . this is also only available on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux needs to be functioning for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
intern@@ ally they are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources various names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ na source , source , source , v@@ cd@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ scanner , t@@ v@@ source , source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start with the play@@ list .
is there advis@@ es such as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive more qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run by root as root as root to the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts up slowly , why must my CPU be tested every time each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ led c@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the latest stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ ile ; required .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional sample application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used on the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution can be included . for installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be attracted .
the &amp; Del@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . they permit a simple installation without further comp@@ ile and are contained on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; c@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users can hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is taken into consideration . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact should be built over the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
if you have any questions or check boxes ; on or if extensions is desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; c@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , direct and custom@@ ised access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , offers &amp; support for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin with the editor &apos;s title with the editor of &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H . that is difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( engl@@ ish@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ macro . a less demanding but realistic interpretation is that it origin@@ ates from Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
in this case , only a good news look at &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book for it . for example , there is not the ultimate book . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ emon .
just like other pron@@ unci@@ ation languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that will be defined with the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text library with the text . the introduction must be closed with the command \ \ issue { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a major function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; . selecting the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some opportunities for creating the document . it can also be done some of the document related settings .
document categories : this is her@@ eby referred to the type of document document : articles ( article ) , Book &#91; book &#93; , Report &#91; Report &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ ungs &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ able &#93; , projector &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; , Fo@@ il &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this is set to set the character codes . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most widely used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they are only in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) : the document categories of Com@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN standards ) . you should always find German text .
new users are now not worried anymore . these are merely a brief description of the functions and further information in this section .
&amp; c@@ ile ; provides - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ matching ) . you should remember any mathematical environment that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is possible through the high@@ lighting time and Ã ¼ r@@ ator .
with automatic adjustment of environments for entering a new command ( for example \ \ &apos; { order } ) of &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically creates a space ( for entering the text ) and the add @-@ on line to be closed ( e.g. \ \ end { orders } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ; set up the La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into a few elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; provides the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ trac@@ ing element ) :
when changing the document , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective piece .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files can be found very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; rounded File ) &#93; has been created , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as font size and is also available in addition to PDF the available output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the r@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ink search , the elements of the DVI ; file is coupled with the editor and as soon as an element in DVI ; -@@ file has been cli@@ cked on the opposite section . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is cli@@ cked , the relevant passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer is spec@@ kled .
Master @-@ Document : this feature is used for work with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified using other embedded .@@ tex files . in the use of a project can be set up to project project settings .
quick assembly : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( provided no error in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode the DVI ; file can be downloaded on paper . it takes no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; it takes place after the rapid assembly .
when viewing the processing tool bar , the three large selection criteria should be observed . the first selection box has been developed for the fast gain of document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The negoti@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box for further information is available for items such as Tags , fu@@ sions , notes or references . the available articles are :
name : with this command , a name for one section , one image or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection box ) .
when using quote , a list of selection is displayed with literary ad@@ ditions . for the editing of &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; c@@ ile ; written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ mer@@ it will be used for the establishment of the font . it can be specified for the main text , mer@@ si@@ or notes , etc . , the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; c@@ ile , two choices of selection are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document from selecting the document type and legend section . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the bra@@ ckets according to the command \ \ &apos; box contains the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . if the font is not established , it can also happen in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the easiest way to this is to use the menu button or the button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing automatically .
if you missed the document , you should be searched for errors in the log . if you use fast @-@ construction activity &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece . if this is not the case , it should also be considered the log@@ ging .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text which is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the text may have a different font . the command \ \ may { wonder } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } may be enligh@@ tened .
the changes will only be seen within the area ( from \ \ inst@@ ances } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within a environment .
there are many opportunities to be heard of the legi@@ bility and us@@ ability of the document . it can be changed , for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ { { emp@@ h } : this command is available for the cur@@ sive pressure and is open until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be rendered extensively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Quant@@ um : created a quote from the document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; { ote } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
in view of the background to the writing of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; presentation language , now a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; .
once the wiz@@ ard has been entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be carried out . this should be a quote , a few positions in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor to the editor . in an external viewer , the window should be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script language ; / PDF file . easy to try and have fun .
DVI ; is a rounded file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers from the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi edition like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF Converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are available as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed out using the file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar requires the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was created , the conversion can begin using existing P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ trial search illumin@@ ate the direct jump from the editor to the desired position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; h@@ ile ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binding files . only modern must be able to set up with Settings ... tools bal@@ lot .
to search for the for@@ mid@@ able search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in one line of the source code and will be cli@@ cked on a front @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer is then carried out .
this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; dimensions and to the corresponding line spec@@ s . to do &amp; check ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as text editor is specified ( Settings ... Editor )
if using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer can &apos;t find an error , it may be an error in the log file , or in the news window , or in summary .
the log file extension refers to the source code in the source code . in the editor then the buttons can be used in error messages . the log file is always displayed on the error in which the error appears to be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging , navigating immediately to the error .
once upon the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window is available to select the presentation of the presentation for the document . the default values are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can be used either by reason for a new document or the assistant to the rapid creation of a new document . more information on this section are included in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates are made in &amp; c@@ ile ; prepared , stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you must either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be created or a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document , and create a presentation of file template .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables may set up in settings ... settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entry in document design . typically , they will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; Class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard , and that for the verb@@ s of the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps has been completed :
when creating a new document , then your own template instead of the standard size can be grown .
a presentation may be created from each &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files are created . a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the Internet and be dr@@ illed under steps under described steps .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers based on many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . lots of settings for &amp; Kate ; can be done directly in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his mom should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; click there directly with the reading of the title &amp; Kate ; start .
&amp; c@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command refer@@ ential which may be called for the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can contains a description of virtually all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with a press C@@ tr@@ l key to explo@@ it the &amp; tex . this means that in this way clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with gro@@ an lin@@ ker mou@@ st@@ aste , the selected text is automatically switched into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons , you can taste pieces of the source code in the editor window .
&amp; hur@@ ry ; has the ability to brow@@ se the various types of source tex@@ tures and emphas@@ ise this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another colour .
a lot of assist@@ ants can be affected . this is an independent type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu indicator can be emphas@@ ized within the text , or the corresponding key stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that they will automatically be emphas@@ ized in the first input of a character automatically .
editing is probably one of the main problems when using a program like &amp; c@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate , offers great opportunities for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important commands for their selection . under edit outputs , the following commands are contained to the text code :
a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides have an empty line ) . this extended meaning does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; c@@ ile ; is that the image is separated by two empty lines .
the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a yield ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for a part of a part of the document cannot be removed up and by pressing the button . &amp; Kate ; provides the key line C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides with own instructions here for faster speeds . under edit removal , the following commands are included to the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; c@@ ile ; is included in the description of edit equipment .
it was already obvious that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; for this reason , provides &amp; c@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit environment for a pleasant easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ &apos; { environment } is , will be spra@@ yed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many snow@@ ed environmental commands , quickly the sun view can be lost quickly . this command closes the last environment , so that the harsh ambient conditions is not demolished .
&amp; c@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } are determined . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that meet from editing environment .
with this command , jump to the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the re@@ conditioned cl@@ amp .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , the other end of the group is spec@@ kled ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many snow@@ ed groups @-@ bra@@ ckets can quickly be lost quickly . this command puts the last part , so that the la@@ stly structure of the &amp; tex ; groups can not be broken .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple operation symbols will be used as a corporation . for the purpose of the purpose is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple beginnings is used . also for the end of the beginnings , the sign &quot; is used . &amp; c@@ ile ; knows this case and makes for two complete beginnings for dos@@ ing &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry for double digits can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and can be switched off .
it can also be used in specific settings ( e.g. wet or French ) and therefore German or French beginnings . there are also many other languages available .
in the pressure of Shift ; It@@ ems ten@@ ds &amp; c@@ ile ; a smart line breaks . if the current position is located within a list environment ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line of line but at the same time the command \ \ item is at the same time .
close to a tables , close &amp; hur@@ ry ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a close @-@ end line break down .
even better - &amp; c@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ installed &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom @-@ defined environments . you can set up and set up the La@@ Te@@ X .
some users can arrange the columns in tables and do all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) each other . &amp; c@@ ile ; try not to er@@ adic@@ ate . in the pressures of shift ; alt ; amp ; seek &amp; c@@ ile ; after the least t@@ apped tab@@ ulator in the next line . although this tab doesn &apos;t add the door to the columns of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code completion was added , these in &amp; c@@ ile ; in order to extend special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . of these , three according as needed and the other two are suitable for automatic ver@@ itable . all these modes are used for different modes of settings .

when pressing the click button , the last letter of input will be removed and you will see the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also shr@@ ink the list by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions will become easier for selection of a command . alternatively , you can &apos;t allow to restri@@ ct to these positions via the Edit brand , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible with the Edit brand , and the resulting parameters can be changed .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , have a little effort to do with &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; even though this plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can not wait until someone is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; it can be found further down below .
to install plug@@ in or a part with the Plu@@ gins , we start the following dialog :
this dialog allows all the plug @-@ ins to manage and add new users . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding Plu@@ gins without a storage location &amp; quantitative ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project for several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; supports speci@@ fying team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email comments are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user name of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who it is . this is done by searching the Te@@ ach@@ ometer from the list and the button s@@ me@@ ar as expresses . the currently selected member ( its own identification ) appears bold according to which you are : text .
nick@@ name and the attitude of your own identity are important concerning news and notes . see further information on notes .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage due to the recording of the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the team leaders , if something specific happens . see further information .
event actions are promotions that are executed if something specific in the project happens . an example would be the record of opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone has worked , or a script that plays a file into the CVS , as soon as they will be added to the project , etc ;
on the page event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog dialog , events can be created , edited and er@@ ased .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list of the add@@ res@@ see list . the address may be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in , knows such conduc@@ tors .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note : it may be selected either in the Editor @-@ context menu or copy the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by decree text .
notes can be sent to a decisive member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader , Sub@@ project manager Sub@@ project leader After the Area Manager and Sub@@ project leaders should be led , as in the examples below .
nick@@ name and roll @-@ names are independent of large - or small @-@ inscri@@ ptions , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the note : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting , supported by DT@@ D ag@@ nostic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scripts .
the settings are easily accessible via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description of the others can be found in .
the settings can be set by means of Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog covers a few pages dedicated to each other .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / Small en@@ roll@@ ment of tags : large / small en@@ roll@@ ment automatically added tags . normal big / small @-@ writing means , the tags will be added as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / Small en@@ roll@@ ment of attributes : large / micro @-@ writing of automatically added attribute . normal big / small @-@ writing means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags include : if desired , it will be optional for tags that are the exclusive day , navigating immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not close optional tags : as above for any other tags , except for simple tags .
automatically Update : when enabled , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of accent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the corresponding coding during enem@@ a .
M@@ IM@@ E types : m@@ im@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using the Standard to restore , the standard specifications can be restored .
standard string encoding : the encoding of re @-@ produced or in other ways than open @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be transferred ) , but this setting is out@@ lined by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is charged .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is out@@ lined by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is charged .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies , so that during a black@@ out or crash when next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for even not stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the Edit@@ or@@ field or a personal view ( or documentation in a box ) that makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview , and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful if the user interface has come through to change the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on the views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ rack layout parameters .
the warning message facility serves as the tax @-@ tax option to un@@ lock the display of war@@ nings by An@@ ha@@ ken by no more .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be defined by symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of V@@ PL@@ - and source @-@ related view in divided mode . regarding the various modes , see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure @-@ tree , which represents the picture of the Par@@ ser no@@ des , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure @-@ tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the Stru@@ c@@ tural Valley with the mouse button@@ ing .
in the field of structural change settings , the visibility of node in the tree can be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are found , in which there is no element found in the current document .
the range for fixed short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) that will be un@@ folding in the editing process . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be divided into several &amp; DT@@ EP ; s . this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ config abbrevi@@ ation something different , as in a group valid for j@@ av@@ ascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be administ@@ rated here . plug@@ ins are used from the third side that can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most well @-@ known &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . inser@@ ting an plug @-@ in must be given the following :
address : the path to the Plu@@ gin , if it &apos;s not at a stand there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is delivered to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the appropriate folder ( path of the current file ) or the project file .
component of the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to load . only read @-@ in @-@ parts do not accept the store when this option is not chosen .
check the Plu@@ gin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the distributed information is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely developed . however , the support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bug@@ ger was set as well as the support for d@@ b@@ g de@@ bug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented , which allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ iti@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bug@@ gers for a project begins with the selection of a matching de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bug@@ ger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the contents of guarded variables is displayed . usually , the left Do@@ ck is usually displayed .
one view , where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed , usually appears at the bottom dock .
a view which is shown in output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bug@@ gers , normally appears at the lower do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ gers , everything is available or part of the following functionality .
with this promotion , the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger , if necessary , manufactured , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on debit needs . this action is activated by default , when a project is open , which must not be respected in the normal case .
the session at Deb@@ ug@@ gen Session Star@@ ck the meeting . closes the connection to the de@@ bug@@ ger or termin@@ ate the foli@@ age to requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to the server to run a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bug@@ ger output .
shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and the currently recorded line regularly . if this happens , while the script is completed , the execution phase begins , the script will start with the requirement .
shows the de@@ bug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without sending information on surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is completed , the execution begins , as soon as a requirement is signed .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next command to enter the script without entering the functions or includes .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger runs the next command in the script , with it possible when possible in functions and includes .
indicates the de@@ bug@@ ger to transfer the instruction and to go to the next , as if there &apos;s not the current .
opens a dialog , which can be entered into a variable or an expression , which is to be monitored . the surveillance value appears in the vari@@ abl@@ ement view .
with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how you can adapt and to adapt to your needs , and how you can &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; can be better to become better .
document type E@@ editing packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . their simplicity and flexibility is made of &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bars . day files contain two data types , the day folder and the tool bar . day files are hand@@ crafted , symbolic number of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions quickly into a document as a user could .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) defines both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; self . tool@@ bars enable quick inser@@ ting tags in a document without danger of a write defect .
tag folders are not as folder . they only contain the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders will bear the name of the descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to make other users a better viewing and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each item in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations are placed in simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains the only element type on itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script type . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
only valid for the day class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( Family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . gives the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
set a text in the dialog . this text is defined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for any attribute . additionally , it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally , there is more tags that are displayed , as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element @-@ type element .
indicates the source code used for the attributes in day Edit@@ or@@ dialog , and attribute to the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ological name within &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method@@ ological name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is an element @-@ element element .
specify the position of the attributes within a dialog box . this tag can only occur in a dialog box ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that can occur within the specified tags . this element is an element @-@ element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; And must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be done by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces it , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML file , the tools can start dialog above in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and checked Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not yet available . currently , check only with the loading of the Tag@@ XML file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file is intended to be schem@@ a.@@ day .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file will be described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; function &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings ; for a list of file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; General &#93; Version = version 1 for &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D configuration . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
action can set up with settings actions ... click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned to this action . selecting the button User can be assigned to a key short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard abbrevi@@ ation .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the Det@@ er@@ ulated settings and inserted this text in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications can be started ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of document ) . even here are the rapid start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EP@@ s .
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be stated . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ osis in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts local scripts : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
% f : we have replaced the document &apos;s URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input can be set by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus in default . in the box input may be determined , which is to be sent to the default setting . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only available with this setup .
in accordance with the input , the issue of the specified use can also be re@@ directed . there are two types : normal output , on the default issue . errors can be specified , which is due to the default issue written by which the value is set to select :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . in that case it is necessary to create an own tool@@ bar . in that case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool bar is added , you will need to add actions and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , in case the day attributes has and you are planning to edit dialogue &quot; tag , &quot; if available , so you can use when entering the action is possible .
ignor@@ ant ! is this a bad symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
for creating a symbol that the action is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; menu , graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that the created symbol can not only help you remember what action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP .
in view that the day start , means , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually referred to as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; starting the day in current document .
after the creation of the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the Settings menu . this is done via the Settings menu . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
choose the folder , where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue using other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK to finish .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; functions for the tool@@ bar or it should be divided into several groups . open the tool@@ bar and set the tool above settings of tool@@ bars . ensure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , which is added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the tap@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , kno@@ b the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by pro@@ ving all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after new@@ e@@ XML does not exist , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool bar is being loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps to add the noted extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users the possibility to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then , you need to let the do@@ cr@@ c file . we will need to handle the second part here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = wh@@ ad , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for this document , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 Sec@@ tions 1 = RI@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 1 = RI@@ 1.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ day = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation . for example , see in the &amp; PHP documentation ; documentation here something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = t@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Re@@ action .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax = Mod@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ d.@@ html ...
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . it shows that it is about sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known fron@@ tier for chess training depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the contents can be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but make sure to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . this should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ files will be replaced .
the content of the ingredient is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed as a writing of a &amp; PHP ; script file for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function can be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text List ) and the file connections .
a simple list of separated context @-@ based elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / doc / apps / quant@@ a / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as specified as do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have been working with the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to divide the her@@ ni@@ fied resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool @-@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the scripts and scripts .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archives , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them and only do it when our team needs them as correct and us@@ ef@@ ull for the publication to make it a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this makes the source of resources guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when you upload your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG @-@ key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case you have several keys , you can check out the input fields ( URL @-@ preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the upload starts .
the upload can also be upload from the DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( DT@@ EP ) , tool @-@ like tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , we examine &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by exam@@ ining integrity and significance . if the integrity is given and the resource may be cancelled correctly , a message with the declaration of the origin@@ ator is the resource .
it is possible to work with XML languages which is currently not yet produced by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in the tag XML format . there &apos;s the easier way to convert DT@@ D into a DT@@ D package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and Conver@@ t to a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string which should appear in the DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quant@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus there are some key concepts . in order to understand these fundamental concepts and take advantage of this fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; to bring little use to them .
in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project . this distinction is concerned with a number of components in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; util@@ ised . of tool@@ bars about promotions is everything as global is marked in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . this allows the group of administ@@ rators in different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns of the global tree that are available to each in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are custom @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so that they can only use such users .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically designed for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are set out in the folder tree , and the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project management .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some key areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the building man@@ ners , the cart@@ ei@@ re@@ side with information and the tool@@ bars . please put in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the box with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all boxes , re@@ charge , er@@ ase or upload of document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the Edit@@ or@@ de to another context menu regarding the processed documentation , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string is named under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editors are the tool@@ bars of the editor . at present &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool bar is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of tool bar is really easy . if they wish to insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the day . now , you can input the data for this straight day . if you want to add a day that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog box different fields .
the construction sector ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate in the information &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; to navigate them to and through . in the representation with ant@@ lers stand for files , project , sample positions , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction materials are available .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project via the right mouse click . actions such as Add , Rem@@ ov@@ ing , High load or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out with the then displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , programming , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what it is used . the category depends on the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more in templates are available .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information about a script . via the right mouse button you can start to edit , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor position is set on the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands can be opened in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among other buildings . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change , which allows the change of all the available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development . you can download the package documentation for &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; from the quant@@ iti@@ lus ; document documentation can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; two flash@@ ers at the bottom of the window , can be achieved above the useful information : the news window and the problem windows .
this cartridge displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are indicated .
this box @-@ saver shows all errors in the check up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; scripts that are executed are all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the tool bars ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the tool@@ box of tool@@ bar is the ability to define their own commands as an symbols in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email . &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; like any others secure and invite !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this reason , auto@@ conf might have a number of options to get the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . these options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems at stake of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that does not contain any older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
during an effort to create the best &amp; coding , the developers of &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ dable Mark@@ up editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; for this is the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; development community is based on the outstanding efforts of free software , the idea of Why evolution is not only this possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; so to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can be increased productivity nearly every task . by the program Kom@@ í@@ bles it can expand them &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; wi@@ eld without any script language syn@@ tax . ( more on this , they find in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to an extended editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; connected . the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run a hel@@ p@@ center help : / quant@@ a ) .
&amp; quant@@ a ; is currently developing and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list from files that you have opened . this list changes every time , if you open a file that is not located on it , the el@@ dest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later usage . check in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project presentation folder , will only be reported errors .
converted to insert from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ write , so it is properly displayed and not used by the browser as form@@ atting .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ write what the correct way to insert a special character and space character in &amp; URL ; s . first , add to the inser@@ tion of &amp; URL ; s into the anchor @-@ day are used .
automatically switches the option to or off . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
search for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . an art gre@@ p or used word with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the news window , or not on . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ ger .
discharge and en@@ roll@@ ment of the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the main window is activated once you replace the structure @-@ tree .
shows the symbol links left from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in menu with entries pre@@ dat@@ or or next , depending on the cur@@ s@@ ors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , according to the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file .
presented a dialog to add files to the current project . the selected files are then copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory according to new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy graphic files to your project file or a sub@@ folder and add it to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation options depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in the chapter and quant@@ iti@@ lus projects , please refer to the details .
downloads a project tool . these are kept in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings . tool@@ bars are saved by means of tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removed a tool bar from the view@@ point . this does not delete it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar still , you will be asked if you want to do that .
so you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool bar than app@@ endi@@ x .
allows high @-@ load tool@@ bars on the main server , where any other can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or someone else has done and convert to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
un@@ loading / un@@ cover the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the de@@ parts are out of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this is global , and write per@@ missions in the global K@@ DE file is not available , the store fails .
this menu includes a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day @-@ setup dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ating or activ@@ ates intelligent inser@@ tion tags . currently , this is only working with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smar@@ ter entry means that &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; add to the tool@@ bar when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the Plu@@ gins menu , the available plug @-@ ins under the above mentioned menu items are listed , click it . clicking on a activated plug @-@ in disabled .
elec@@ ting the syn@@ tax@@ ies mode for the current file . the list of available articles schem@@ atics depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .

immediate shut@@ down between different types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch@@ over can sometimes need time or create un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default mode , or the bottom mode , which is the presentation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
additionally , this menu contains one entry for each open sub@@ window . with a contract , the corresponding function will be activated .
switches the status bar &apos;s status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main draw on or off .
the changes in this dialog can be used to use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ brow@@ sers .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can change the sequences .
it should create a help according to the mouse &apos;s environment , but it is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but , as with any open source project , developers can always use aid . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; developing in financial form , you will find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties can be adjusted .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when typ@@ ing of name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the expansion of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine , which one wants to access , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log can be used . depending on the remote controller , an adaptation must be necessary .
that is the folder , in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of the standards .
that is the folder , in which the tool bar will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of the standards .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change . if scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
Indic@@ ates if files located anywhere in the main file of the project are supposed to be included . if a project is started to re@@ build , not touch .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of good @-@ thin .
this shows a list of files located in the main folder . you can select the desired files due to an@@ ha@@ ken or remove by removing the ham@@ let , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload or upload these settings in the menu with Project Properties in the menu @-@ window , or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which will be re@@ iter@@ ated in project @-@ related operations like the project file .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be re@@ loaded with opening the project , can be read more about project views .
this enables you to select the desired de@@ bug@@ ger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . you can find more about G@@ ub@@ ed . the de@@ bug@@ ger plug @-@ in can be set with the button options . in this , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a supervision for the content of the server for each profile , which will restri@@ ct your own tree view to each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can add event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed if a particular event occurs , such as the saf@@ est one file . see details .
by default it opens &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior is currently not possible to influence .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar . the dialog project will open , and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; closed , the project file will automatically be stored . you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving , when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
there are free access to the files in the project . there , files can be administ@@ rated in the current project .
folders behave just as well , however , entries are missing and opening up with ... in conjunction with the right button of the context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile includes information about the location of uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be hidden in order to prevent removing packages .
the password will keep in memory and forget by program . this option is useful if common high up@@ loading files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the plate is not stored in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue , when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; many upload profiles are created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded into different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialogue is displayed :
this is the server name that should copy the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and installed the installed Ki@@ o Sla@@ ves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the Network administrator does not operate any service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be read on the plate , but everyone with programm@@ ers can see it easily in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simply exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with whom one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adjust@@ ing &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; to your own work mode .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; best above the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool bar . use and add themselves . adding tool bar will be treated in the section adding of tool@@ bars below .
the tool@@ bars and the symbols on it can be set either by the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action can remove , tool bar , ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog where actions can be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a promotion ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and the promotion worked , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings of tool@@ bars ... and set the settings .
templates are made in essential documentation , code sni@@ p and files to link . &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; used templates as a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or each of the system available existing directory in the storage room . templates are set in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you can set for the file system .
some with &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; provided templates are conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually inserted in documents by lin@@ king ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples will be found in the storage room under global templates . more information about the templates is available .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . usually it makes a simple rum@@ our for the purpose and organized the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in storage space under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is being included on a presentation but the same text area always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the storage room under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
as the name says , these templates are serving as templates . you are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus .
design a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As Tem@@ plates save as local template ....
once that is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project @-@ tree . look at the storage room under project conditions .
select text in your document and click on the File as Tem@@ plates save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn simply with pulling and dismant@@ ling on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a template file . it can be used all file management functions for it , such as pulling and dismant@@ ling or inser@@ ting over the file @-@ tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on the file tree or in the project file construction overview on a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the presentation and secure . by default it is saved in the project file , but of course it can be saved as local or global presentation .
project projects enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert or attach dynam@@ ically to &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link with them . in addition , you can put some things while using templates in projects very profound in mind .
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files generated in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / quant@@ a / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to determine the behavior of a folder , click with the right mouse button on the folder and to select the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden as soon as indicated by the attributes .
this is enabled by default and fit for everything except for the regular folders . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the B@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ tree . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder .
allows you to read or copy text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head lines / foot@@ er a full presentation already with matching head lines / foot@@ er .
additionally , we also have the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ iti@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be accessed via the menu view . the first mode is replaced by the source editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second mode : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it downloads a document like normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor will appear . then you can edit and when needed for the source code editor , in which the changes contained in the V@@ PL ; editor is visible in the source code .
when working with V@@ PL ; editor to a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ presence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor and PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first one , except for the changes both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously is running . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the button pressure transfer the active cur@@ sor over a window to suit , whereby the position is kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta ; -@@ view can be set between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . if the selection is automatically switched on , the recommendation can be set to a quick host and a great span for slow computer .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to choose invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . it is intended to change the h@@ acking code . so you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows change of the in@@ descri@@ ped , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add c@@ ss @-@ rules with buttons below the list or delete . a change via the list is accurate as met@@ a @-@ elements is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and cho@@ oses the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is used like in a word processing , through connection with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor is pec@@ uli@@ ar . the mark@@ er works as usual . text can be inserted into typ@@ ing and removed using the touch or distance paste .
inser@@ tion tags will be done in the same way as in the source editor , as in the source editor . it is to be aware that the inser@@ tion of tags before already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor @-@ day , en@@ circle with text , must be removed each other surrounding anchor .
some tool@@ bars like the tables @-@ assistant or the lists wiz@@ ard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; you &apos;ll have to work in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of breast@@ feeding systems . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding systems , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of style can be persecuted .
in order to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you &apos;ll need to comp@@ ile , except &amp; K@@ DE ; the lib@@ x@@ s@@ LT libraries need lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical &amp; K@@ DE installation ;

there are many graphic tools for the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contributions changed many changes and at the same time I had corrected the entry . another programmer had changed a lot in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in mer@@ ging .
that from me the program showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly had changed within this lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the entry had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; found differences in line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of other useful functions were added later .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also , 3 @-@ way mer@@ gers will be fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently in one piece of co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps to modify the correct result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen photo shows three quant@@ um files at mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you to merge the same and merge folder . this screen photo shows &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; with folder merge :
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the precise differences and stim@@ ulates the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently need to check , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the summary at the left side on the left side . ( no trouble if any one changes the entry notice ) .
when a file is equal , and the other differs in a row , the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both files distinguish .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder divi@@ der 2 , folder safety 2 folder , folder 2 folder divi@@ der 2 folder divi@@ der 2 folder folder 3 -@@ O target folder
the open dialogue allows the manual setting of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the back list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
using the button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be introduced . if you select a file , for B and C but a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when M@@ erg@@ ing is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to determine an output file immediately . you can do this step later while saving .
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set the options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all the file but only parts of a text . &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to pull text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in opening dialogue you must not select any files , you can simply connect the dialog to the breaking button .
you can also use pulling and dismant@@ ling : just draw a file from a file manager or selected text , and let it fall over a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains , for example , several similar functions . if you would like to figure out how to create these functions , this would be a relatively big effort . you would have to load two corresponding files , add them in &amp; to diff@@ 3 ; now you can copy the relevant sections simply , insert and then compare .
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything &amp; cover diff@@ 3 ; only the text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors will interpre@@ t the pulling and placing text in another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case your original data may be lost .
in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B , C , the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse to rest a while above the line . then a small aux@@ iliary window will display the full name . )
the three source codes are the letters A , B and C . a color blue , B and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one looks at the color , which file differs . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well .
left next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding colour . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line which separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places , where the source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the results window ( under the compar@@ ators ) also has a info line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next deleted / un@@ rest conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , any difference is also a conflict of manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group &apos;s first line is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will appear . ( this group will also be highlighted the current group in the background . ) This group will appear at the background colour of background colour and on the left , a black beams appears on the left .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ gers or by manual processing no further line remains in the group ; then this text is displayed in the text ; then you will change your mind , and perhaps a different source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er you may copy and insert it elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; frame permits ; however , appear in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy the text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : if you select the sources , ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the picture @-@ run and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys , turn right , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l @-@ end , si@@ w as you can also use of other programs . the over@@ flow column next to the vertical image bar can also be used by clicking on the navigate .
in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ fishing mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a Click on the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the section ) and the edit windows .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) , to the next / former conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Figure / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) or to the next / former conflict . however , you do not automatically resolve the conflict as a conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ solved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the mark@@ er to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this option is activated , the option is automatically copied and the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally file the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line @-@ based devices are stored accordingly to the basis of the operating system . UNIX @-@ based systems use a line @-@ in @-@ thrust @-@ character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the line @-@ driven C \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ based source files , therefore you should use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and list of last used files are stored automatically and the next start is re@@ produced . ( menu insert &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width , but you should not use it . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ic writing . if the scrip@@ ture is not supported , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be rendered . on these systems the button settings will automatically create an odd colour .
if this option is enabled , the Tab key inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when entering or return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying in the cli@@ p@@ board is then cancelled .
you can select which line @-@ type you prefer to save . the default value is the general choice on the operating system used .
when compar@@ ing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all full @-@ identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage drive &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others again store only one line @-@ in &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then you might save files with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then you might have a white character . during the mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled . this option is de@@ activated .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis the numbers are ignored and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
the default setting is disabled in default . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in automatic start @-@ up mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ rest conflict is passed .
solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are used in many files . if you do not need to ignore the elec@@ ts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored , ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning the folders and execute a merge . check for details under documentation on the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is stored and already an older version is existing , then the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ore hung . if there is already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further f@@ use .
matches the language of the interface . this option does not concern the current running program . you need to end &amp; restart your current program . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set on the control centre in the K@@ DE version . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if this option is enabled , the top setting is used for all entries .
the code for the code appears a short indication of which the local code is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has purely inform@@ al character . )
watch the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted , because the coding for each file can be individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
when you have edited a file , you can specify which code should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they could not function with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing commands can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) By this option , you can define the encoding of output commands .
switch this off to supp@@ ress the changes in white characters in the text or over@@ looks . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a coded random column . but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is indicated by the normal another one second transfer column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . get simply the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the compar@@ ative window to each other or above . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to bring the files together . if you &apos;re using only two files . a simple click will start merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
in reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your requirements . for example , you can use this function , for example , to dis@@ connect parts or to correct loading .
in reading a file , it is handed over to this external command . if a normal preparation command was specified ( see above ) , then the command is used to write this preliminary processor . you can only write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds to your requirements . each entry line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to enable users more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff &apos;s results . however , an external program requires , and most users don &apos;t want to program it even though . the Good news is that , in most cases , sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this process commands for line @-@ off to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ U \ \ 1 \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a found expression on each string which refers to the found text in the first row couple . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters .
using CVS and other version control systems , use some keywords to insert strings from the same pattern ( info @ c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . therefore , the \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ _ BA@@ R
while you experim@@ enting with used , you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for further processing commands for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equals suitable . sed &quot; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you would like to perform several episodes at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate each other from each other . example :
instead of used , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ E &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / Er@@ ror / switch &apos; allergy is different at per@@ l a few details . if used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . the further operations change only the data , which sees the line equal to al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the issue of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changed or hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . from that reason you can compare with &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ ital@@ ic and merged .
... makes for each object a proposal to merge ; you may adapt the proposal to the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without it really accomplish ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of individual files . you only need to open folder on command line or in the dialog box .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , use &amp; diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform you a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , that were compared to then .
when the scanning is complete , shows &amp; diff@@ use diff@@ 3 ; a catalog window with the results on the left , ...
each file and each folder was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed manually by clicking on + / - , or double @-@ click on the object , or by using the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory contains two functions , open all the sub@@ directories and valves , with which you can open all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first file ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane shown on the selected object . in such a case , the mer@@ hr operation can &apos;t be chosen automatically . if the mer@@ ging is started , you will be informed about problems of this type once again .
as seen in the above image , in the columns A / B / C the colors Red , Green , Yellow and Black are used .
for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even when the age of entries are different .
folders will be considered identical if all of its content is identical . then also folder the same color . with folders , the age is infin@@ itely for its colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colours of a sheet that is only green , then yellow will and later when it is old , is red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such corrupt objects , the merge can &apos;t be started .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B file is ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such corrupt objects , the merge can &apos;t be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folder were given , and if the option is synchron@@ ized active . then choose &amp; b diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : mer@@ ging and the result in both folders . ( the user looks like the visible field names for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copies &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the option of new file instead of mer@@ ging ( uns@@ ure ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date files are different , but the same date feature appears , but the date is identical .. While such mistakes are not removed , the merge does not be started .
during the merge , a file is processed after the others . if the assembly has been successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly different messages , if something unexpected is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is fine .
when described in the setup dialog , the file compar@@ ative Analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these include the number of mon@@ ast@@ eries , sol@@ vent , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ ving conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either assemble either the selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all summar@@ ize actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you don &apos;t have any target folder , then in three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as target , while two @-@ folder merge is B as the target and when synchron@@ ize , A and / or B is used as target .
if you select a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to avoid un@@ lov@@ able surprises :
to bring together all entries : select directories , proceed in the directory , or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . in order to bring together only the current record : choose Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if using contradic@@ tory data types are still incomplete , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action .
when you assemble all entries , a dialog window appears with the options , sim@@ ulate and break down .
if you want to see what would happen , if you want to see what really changes will happen , you will get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; then runs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( together a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window opens ( note the screenshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select again / proceed or press F@@ 7 . if you are not yet saved , a proper dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue his work with the next entry .
if &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information is displayed . at the end of the list you will see some errors that will help you to try out the cause of the problem . thus , you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries are individually summar@@ ised , please note &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not lead them together . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries are re@@ generated again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified patterns are displayed in the element tree . you can replace the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mat@@ isch generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be specified with an .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( check out at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
in some fil@@ esystem files , files are an attribute . in other fil@@ esystem selected files a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element @-@ tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
for links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links are treated as normal folder and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions ) would lead to an end loop and &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched on default .
a complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ el@@ ast@@ eries , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower , if it is applied to files containing no text ( specify an appropriate Anti @-@ Pat@@ tern ) .
if you compare large folders via a slow network , it &apos;s possibly faster than to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use with caution . this option is shut down in default .
similar to Confi@@ dence the date of change . it is no real comparison . the files are considered equal when copying the date of alter@@ ations has been lost . please use caution with caution . this option is shut down in default .
activ@@ ating the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder . in this mode the proposals are identical . the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as a promotion . ( this will be considered uncertain as the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ ines already exists , so it will be deleted without another backup . this also applies to normal mer@@ ging single files , not just the mer@@ ging d@@ folder . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge @-@ merge tool remains visible to the mer@@ ging single files ; you can turn the divi@@ der divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn the main window in the window menu and switch through the switch between Directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file via double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory . once you can store the file , the status is set to be done , and the file will not again run together if you start the folder .
however , this status comes down if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. contain . it &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the server system on the server , sometimes by the used protocol , it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished , if a link is shown on a file or a folder . then , it will always be adopted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no option to edit per@@ missions , or change of change . therefore , auth@@ oriz@@ ations or change of change from the original . ( note this option is confidenti@@ ality of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op will always start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part advertis@@ ements from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part file , it decreases &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files needs to exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; program patch to restore the missing file .
in the conv@@ ex file , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if not the original files exists . furthermore , it is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since creating the patch file .
when &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part performed , it only supports the compar@@ ing of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now are Com@@ pare ) there are already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge the diff@@ 3 program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and I &apos;ve learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that have gone this way or go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script not the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . at default , configure / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you can find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as the same as not identical . i@@ F similar lines of next to Each other , this ble@@ is : this sh@@ is often the case .
the editor remembers for any difference in the files where he starts and ends . this important information is necessary , however , if the result is easily stored as text file , and it is too much effort to design an extra own file format that could save this information .
the effort has so far too big . you can restore a specific version of using a source A / B / C using selecting a source A / B / C . another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly fixed ; no sr@@ c lin@@ s ; appeared and the text cannot extingu@@ ish . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to increase differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the game Wild web . thank you !
to utili@@ ze all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you will find a list of the latest changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the quota package .

only differences are shown : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and consequently , not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to read the folders with the function Update ) to these options .
there are only entries displayed if the differences are correct . if the target folder will not already be copied to the target folder . if the target folder will not already be copied . ( the behaviour will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is switched on default .
notice the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are already present ) , if the lines are already present , they will be returned to the button on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differenti@@ als in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual environments . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to change their size , to end them or move it . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual environments as well as the applications . applications can be selected and even be moved to desktop and other applications .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it is possible to use both within a desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked ; if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu will only appear only the two entries of p@@ ager ... and end . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application and the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . these commands have the following commands :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of your desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is marked , you can move windows inside the &amp; box , with the middle mouse button on your desktop and also be moved to other work@@ places .
when this field is crossed , are in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
cross this field leave the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . indicate the number of virtual environments . is it along with name indicate , the names will be provided with ordin@@ ances , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background each desk will also be displayed in the &amp; p@@ ager background .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; box ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be displayed in order to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program windows . symbol indicates a small view of the actual program icon . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can appear : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ grid appear , like p@@ ager applications in some other windows managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual machines in a horizontal row shows all virtual machines in a vertical range , which is very good for the presentation at the side of desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their content and move . moreover , it runs out of the control bar .
right click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and followed by selecting the switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
at the moment that the dialog can &apos;t be changed to dialog settings , but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not apply to the root account or turn to your system administrator . in this file , you must enter the keys of win@@ dow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and to make it a value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter is a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who suffer the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain @-@ in@@ dium syndrome ) and those of each mou@@ sec@@ lick pain is preparing .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter is a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who are preparing the repet@@ itive strain of the jury ( RS@@ I ) and which each mouse click pain@@ s . however , it can em@@ ulate a bit of exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain when clicking on the mouse and helps to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also find pain associated with the use of your computer , if you are looking for a doctor if this is not yet happened .
to get it clear@@ er again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain means that when pressed with the mouse , it is against pain@@ s that are caused by the moving because of the mouse , us@@ eless . and , as it is applicable to all ergonomic tools , the result may be different for anyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse drag and leads a mouse click once you break the movement in short .
if the intelligent comp@@ ress is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after turning the pushing up of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling out of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling out of tooth@@ paste . the smart shifting demands a little practice , but you get used fast .
after the end of the mouse movement , this delay time must be tra@@ ded before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to perform a mouse click .
if the mouse is switched on , the rotary field is set to move ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after setting the mouse button , before it takes the mouse button , if there is no connection due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the mouse button . if this function is enabled , a slow beam is activated after the right and back , followed by a break , a click on the right mouse button . this movements will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt ; the first time is started , but it can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the response time . go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and click here the tab . there is a shift sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , it is done &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; please draw the corresponding documentation to rate to figure out how to start a program automatically .
set up all settings to the values , which were set up during the opening of the dialogue . have already pressed the button on the bar , setting the settings on the stand after the last pressures of users .
best you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to start with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent comp@@ ress should be switched off first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can insert the smart phone .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it &apos;s necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; K@@ DE .
first of all , you should realize what places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral installation of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not display link , does not lead to un@@ inten@@ tional reactions . you may use the mouse to such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is bu@@ ck , you should make your mouse clean . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is there that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that comes into contact with the mouse ball .
first , you must take out the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse is different from mouse . it should be fast clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole , into which the ball was used . the thresh@@ ing and dirt can easily scra@@ pe them with a flat blade or fing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system uses the design of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a shift in this case , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean anything by rele@@ asing the mouse button .
this happens if you &apos;re using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists that you can run a mouse click here . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; rec@@ alled and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; m@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute cli@@ cks and set the cur@@ sor over another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop if you don &apos;t want to cause a key@@ presses . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces for the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent comp@@ ress , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text .
the intelligent comp@@ ress is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you want to b@@ ypass it into the cli@@ p@@ board or to move , in which you want to move the mouse when pressed mouse button . but it will probably try to cause some problems . here are some advice :
do not use the intelligent comp@@ ress if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead of using a mouse button and hold the switch @-@ pressing key , while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and restart the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this way , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is played a sound like a mou@@ sec@@ lick . so , you know exactly when using intelligent comp@@ ress the ver@@ sho@@ cking time begins . later , you can also use the intelligent comp@@ ress without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . however , it requires some exercise .
in order to use &amp; m@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test Add @-@ in for &amp; X Window ; that should be the case on most of the system .
the audi@@ ble mou@@ cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker , and these are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; actu@@ ated the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter has been dist@@ orted shortly . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I Syndrome and those who have been preparing the m@@ asked pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as it is a certain time that a pulling process begins before the mouse button will start . in this way , the pulling and dismant@@ ling can be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; K@@ mouth ; is a program with the silent users can talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; may be silent users to speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of conversation pro@@ positions which should be spoken once again .
on the first side of the wiz@@ ard ( left ) type , enter the command , which later is used for the speech output of text . further details will be found in the description of the dial@@ ogs .
on the second hand , select the standard text password manual . you can often choose text password , without having to type in . the password passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( correct screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the time of the word . in addition , you read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can compare the words with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ lic@@ ated words can be taken into the wording .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is confident and contains essentially a input field for the key@@ presses of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a transfer of already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
when you set it right , you can enter the pro@@ positions you want to hear in the input field you want to hear . any spoken proposition is attached to the run storage . you can choose from it sentences which should be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the side word and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field , select the command to enter the language setting . in the box below the input field , you specify the character encoding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box when the text remains unchanged as a standard setup to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as parameter , and you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
this command , of course , depends on the speech output of your language generator . you can find this command in documentation on your language generator . examples of this command can be found in App@@ endi@@ x .
with Minim@@ izing Cour@@ t@@ d as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass on the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD service , a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications is a standardized interface for speech output and which is currently not installed in the SV@@ N . the option of this option is sensible , even if the K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
selecting the first selection box in accordance with the selection of a text@@ passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key short@@ cut or by choosing a text@@ passage in the text@@ pass book , or in the bar for text messages .
with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen text passage is inserted directly and additionally inserted in the storage space . with the selection of in the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second sel@@ ector switch box for text password , you can set whether the text password Book should automatically be stored in closing the edit box .
with the selection of text password Book , the book is stored . if you select changes , the text password Book is not saved . select pre @-@ ask , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text password register is supposed to be saved .
the word of meditation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a list box where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for the time of meditation .
with the buttons on the right on the side , you can delete spell check dic@@ tion@@ aries or export the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name in the input field and select the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of each words is determined simply by decl@@ aring of occurr@@ ence . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only right words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to assemble the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these weights are to be generated .
this option lets you specify a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words are automatically added to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary during the time .
the main part of the window to edit text messages is divided . in the upper part , the text messages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the passage passage or the associated ke@@ yp@@ t . if you have selected a text password register , you can only change its name .
actions like new text characters or books add or selected text password and books can either be accessed via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a switch @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text lines or password passages by pulling in the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if using the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage process is used .
the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if using the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the storage process is used .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used otherwise , otherwise , the selected sentences of the calculation .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by mouse click on the sh@@ ined left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place by default .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main character with indication via the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is blin@@ ded .
if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding l@@ ath is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is arranged directly under the tool@@ bar directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the narrow left side and drag , the tool bar can be moved to another place .
you probably have entered the instruction for the voice output not right or not fully entered . open settings to mouth ... , open the page general settings and enter the command for the speech output by the card speech . ( see setup dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
Festival is a voice @-@ voice system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ z are supported . the license allows to use Festival free and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival . the command is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS to use and spread without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language output , the Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / fre@@ eware folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched to default settings . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator with many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ akers in a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in Phon@@ eme to MB@@ RO@@ LA , stating that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA is installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to send the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be attached . the complete command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ sp@@ lay / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in line . this option must be turned on to default .
the speech @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further voice service , which is available to all &amp; K@@ DE . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
because the speaking of the language can only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to be possible to use fe@@ ed@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; mouth .
to setting up the page K@@ TT@@ SD , which is installed in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; it appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; K@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally store for the language generator ) , but it depends on each computer and its configuration .
&amp; K@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak to make text through the computer . there &apos;s a list already being saved , that the user can always be re@@ activated again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not contain any language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . one language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers must be installed on the computer .
detailed user documentation you can find with help : / k@@ mouth ( specify this URL to the address bar from &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or start a hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; t@@ ts ; - the speech system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is an modules of existing service that allows everyone to use text on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; t@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for speech output ( T@@ TS ) . it represents a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers prepared with which applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills . users also offer interesting opportunities .
read from texts ( or parts thereof ) in the Text Editor &amp; Kate ; , also if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications embedded .
the speech output is done via the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the different background programme such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows generation of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) over the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ relief program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech @-@ up languages like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech @-@ service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without the visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .

a module for the web browser &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts of it .
a module for the Text Editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read or partially read .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you start &amp; job ; you have to install the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set it right . see also
when the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer various languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those who set themselves in volume or speed . a so @-@ furnished combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is referred to as speaker . you should use at least one speaker before you start &amp; t@@ aut ; because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is used otherwise the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with multiple pressure reduc@@ ers for the same printer .
if you click on the card reader speaker in t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . this will appear automatically when you start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr and not yet a speaker .
all already furnished speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear at the top in the list . the top speaker is used for the voice output if there is no speaker .
to a mou@@ sec@@ lick , choose a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
to a mou@@ sec@@ lick , choose a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
to a mou@@ sec@@ lick , choose a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speaker in the list certainly defines its priority .
Click on one of these buttons to turn your changes to the running &amp; fix@@ ture ; -@@ system .
choose a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl @-@ voice to choose from .
when you click here , it appears on the new speaker on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; t@@ ts ; you can almost use it . go back to the card of General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so you can use &amp; t@@ ts ; use to read text templates . Click on the map orders to create and manage text messages . see .
if you have at least set up a speaker , you can start the voice arrangement of &amp; K@@ DE . Click on the card reader to open this map . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; t@@ aut ; it starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this is being successful , the card ticket orders will be displayed and you can create text messages , and you can read the marking , will keep K@@ TT@@ SD and de@@ activated the T@@ TS system by &amp; K@@ DE .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , running &amp; t@@ aut ; on , subject to activ@@ ating the field output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is crossed .
if this check box is marked and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically at the system area of the Control bar , it dis@@ appears once the presentation is completed .
with buttons in this series , you can start collecting records , cancel , stop and start recording again .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to advance . you can also switch the speaker for a contract .
Click on users or OK , then all changed settings on all sides are accepted .
the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card reader &apos;s general and cross the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or , in the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; please check the text of the displayed website . first check the text , which should be read before , and select in the main menu Tools Text . after a short time , the speech output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the required text of a web page . you can jump this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ load lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text editor earlier . then , check the text that is read before , and select the Text Editor &apos;s main menu . then select the language output .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you notify about you fixed events . you can read the text of this messages also from &amp; oc@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; K@@ DE ; for example , you can set up various types of messages ; for example , you can set up if in a IR@@ C channel a message appears where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; t@@ ts , you can read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program K@@ noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications to this program . the possible settings for K@@ noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filters for the string field replacement is a good way to correct &amp; oc@@ t@@ orial ; wrong or correct . the file k@@ em@@ .x@@ ml , which is sent to the delivery of &amp; oc@@ ts ; it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent to the mail , and in addition the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as required .
filter are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; oc@@ t ; . for normal work with &amp; oc@@ ts , filters are not required .
in filtering , text is processed before it is sent to the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful to replace the pron@@ unci@@ ation to select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the mode of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; t@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the issue of Screen Re@@ duction has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other contracts , and keeps these orders . if the edition of the Screen Reader is read , the orders received resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority , and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
News , the next second highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; add a long text on a web site , you can enter with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone welcome , who enters the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text@@ records . each order you encounter with the card orders , is a text contract . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have written assign@@ ments . texts are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular drum .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the issue of screen re@@ els . if an application reads the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; t@@ ts , just a such reads , this edition will stop and terminated .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of screen re@@ funds . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , news , and text orders as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filter editing the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three kinds of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future , it can still be more types of filters .
text file replacing parts of a text by other text . these parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions . it is provided with pre @-@ defined type text files , which make the release of chat emotions such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; by a format into another format . included in delivery of &amp; oc@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
with speaker @-@ related filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that send the text to &amp; oc@@ t . if you have set a female voice on the card speaker , you can read the text by K@@ DE @-@ News about it .
each of these different filters are set @-@ up rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter is fixed , its rules does not apply , he will continue the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ notification to &amp; oc@@ ts , it is processed by all activated filters , which were set down on the page below . the processing is done through the filter in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of non @-@ standard filters . if a filter is not activated , it is not activated and is not used . filters will be processed from top to bottom .
Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup dial@@ ogues .
enter a list of words or regular expressions then you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions . these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding spare text . large and small @-@ writing will not be respected in comparison .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose any name , it must be differenti@@ ated by the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column , and replaces it in accordance with the strings from the column setting . the list is modified in the order from above down@@ wards .
Click here to shift the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download or delete a list of words or regular expressions out of a file that delete the current list , or delete a list from the file to the existing list .
if the speaker is registered here , the filter is only used when the speaker for the text order is one of the languages supported here . you can also select several languages if you press the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs are available with the q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ ited . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID head @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you can only enter head .
the string filter system will only be applied to the text if all conditions are used with one entry in the box di@@ oc@@ eses filter if you match . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words , the code system uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ den@@ ces ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you cannot find detailed instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the k@@ ite &apos;s package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Speaker system , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or for a speaker with certain characteristics . you can set for example to read that text by k@@ mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before &amp; t@@ oned ; a text to the filter gives it a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics which the program is selected , sends the text to the board ; sends , and the features of the speaker can be selected on the card speaker .
if a value is listed here , the filter is applied if the text contains the registered regular expression . is on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions , you can call this button on the button to get help when entering the button .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression in the beginning of the string chain , i.e. , start the regular expression using &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the properties of your desired speaker . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . Click on the right to display the dialogue workshop .
use these buttons to store or upload or delete all settings .
the speaker @-@ optional filter is only used on the text if all conditions with one entry in the box di@@ oc@@ eses filter will apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programm@@ ers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications can communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which are added to the K@@ TT@@ SD card syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , allowing it to use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice delivery service via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program l@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
it is text of the text to read and select language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are still more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; windows ; -@@ window . just start t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ converting filters , but with the module &apos;s use for the festival will not be read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so S@@ able is not working . you must then do that if you do not use this voice to read of web pages . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation seem to cause trouble when syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sets of trans@@ forms or just cow@@ ard@@ stick shall be spent . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string qu@@ en@@ ce@@ asing filter . see .

the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the syn@@ thesizer into the supported languages . see also on the website of dict@@ at@@ ts , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; set ; for use of any other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you are using the Develop@@ er team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile it , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded source texts by &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ files or download each night at present tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; job , check first if the speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD conf .
&amp; in &amp; K@@ DE ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; t@@ ts ; used the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program dict@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is not needed and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual phr@@ ases . the user can go back or break down , repeat the output or break down .
if you have an application text on &amp; oc@@ ts , you can request an application for example a female English speaker . if you have a speaker introduced , whose language is English and whose sex is female , otherwise it will be chosen automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; t@@ aut ; a speaker cho@@ oses you will see in .
if you click on the card speaker to add or click a speaker into the list or click on Edit , the card speaker can be displayed . as an example , the module will be shown for festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only need to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text , which is handed over to the festival . in general , it is done automatically that western languages will use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 to use Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak languages , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the syn@@ the@@ tical language . if you cannot select a few controllers , and this grey display , the chosen voice is not allowed to be chosen by you .
some quotes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need multiple seconds to be loaded with their size . if you have to mark this check box , these are already being loaded with the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with higher memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box can &apos;t be selected , you don &apos;t have any spokes@@ man ( or do not forget to click on application ) . see .
if this check box is marked , the program panel is displayed by kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr the program windows . otherwise , after the start , only the icon m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and t@@ t@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t run , it appears in the system area where K@@ TT@@ SD is a text reads . therefore , you have the opportunity to stop reading or to control them .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID on the card speaker .
with buttons in this series , you can select a single @-@ sided on the order that is selected in the list below , pre @-@ going or back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
clicking OK with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ spre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
there are only records listed and administ@@ rated . issues of screen re@@ funds , war@@ nings and messages will not be displayed . more information on the message types of &amp; oc@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was rec@@ alled , either without the support for the respective audio module . it cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no power modules in the list are displayed , you need to install at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device . see also
put the speaking speed here . 50@@ N ; % equal to about half and 200@@ N ; % roughly the double normal speaker speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
Click on users to adopt the new att@@ itudes for running &amp; fix@@ ture ; -@@ system .
the list of the AL@@ SA equipment includes all PCM devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this map , you can set up special actions that will always be executed if the text contract is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; t@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language orders :
the edition of Screen Re@@ duction has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other contracts , and holds these orders . after the issue of the Screen Reader has been read , the orders received resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have priority priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the read of warning .
messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the messages . if you leave &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web site can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome , who enters the room .
if a text@@ contract is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , add &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e long one .
this audio file is always checked , when a normal text application is interrupted when a normal system is active as well , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are valid only for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings and spending by screen re@@ funds there are no particular actions , if they are interrupted by a higher priority .
to read with &amp; t@@ ts ; check note messages , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click on al@@ erts . the card information is published .
mark this check box to turn the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; alert emails . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and rec@@ alled ; reads no messages .
if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , of &amp; oc@@ ts ; do not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that &amp; conversation ; sent when someone menti@@ ons your nick@@ name in a IR@@ C message .
all events , which is nothing else indicated in the list , are ignored by &amp; t@@ ts .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; job ; if an event happens . you have the following selection :
if you selected custom text , enter the required text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard choose the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the card speaker than top entry . see also this too .
note that there are three levels for events . if there is a specific event of a particular application , this is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the specific application . as last option , the action to stret@@ chers , which has been specified under standard ( any other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list ) , you can define the notification messages like this :
use the button to store the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . the invited events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to begin with an empty list , click Clear . all entries will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for a voice output . also trademarks for controlling the voice of voice and pitch . also trademarks for controlling the voice of pron@@ unci@@ ation . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; fix@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partial and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone Voice ( British male ) because this is the default voice , using the SS@@ ML output .
if you do not adjust the settings for speed or pitch in the festival setup dialog , the SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous spoken .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , the first proposition may start syn@@ thes@@ ize , because only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also stop or stop or cancel , even if the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are not directly supported .
here you see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . when the first start of &amp; oc@@ ts , there will be automatically setup a pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . you can change the settings , or add additional pro@@ pul@@ lim@@ iting filters , but is de@@ ferred from it .
in the easiest way , learn the setup of the speaker choice . place the card selection and select text to read . place the speaker selection again and check out how the selection of the speaker is changed . you must , of course , have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; B ; then faster with the advance can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last for a long time ,
you can then hold text contracts to hold or cancel orders on the board card , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are not supported by this function .
for these reasons the normal set @-@ limit filter is automatically set up if you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filters compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab character ( tab @-@ code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set of proposition maintains the character of the character .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never used on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ news ( paper ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of Screen reag@@ ents .
if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , you can add this again by loading the embedded in &amp; t@@ ts ; contained in standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
in the card key selection , you can send the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the card speaker ) . in other words , there are no female speaker characteristics .
use of the matching speaker , which is all the characteristics of a furnished speaker . if you do not er@@ ase or edit the settings of the speaker , cho@@ oses it . otherwise , cho@@ oses the speaker ; otherwise it cho@@ oses the speaker ; the speaker is the most originally introduced properties .
select the method for entering the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box , if the property should be preferred before other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output , this property will always be treated as priority . the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute , is before , if you know that a certain application text in another language is sent to the environment .
to use all the properties in the subject of speaker , which matches the most common list , click on the select button , and then use on speaker , which corresponds to the following below .
in this case , 0 stands for the final text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .
kt@@ oria falls off immediately if it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get tra@@ ce@@ able .

the audio output of AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music on simultaneously with another application , free@@ zes &amp; fix@@ ture ; a message appears on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message that says : side@@ to open PCM .
on your system , the problem is that the conflicts currently occur in AL@@ SA , which will prevent the same time opening of multiple PCM devices . information for possible solutions you will find on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ pro@@ ject@@ .org .
I uploaded an additional voice on the Internet . I installed it and can use it in Festival , but kt@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
if you add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ach@@ d / fest@@ ival@@ int / vo@@ ices , add the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the card audio there is a set speed . this will be able to install the SO@@ X program and the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ s like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored if &amp; fix@@ ture ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reads that the HTML is switched to SS@@ ML ( see ) or if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by SS@@ ML wra@@ pping filter , and set the speech speed up .
I don &apos;t make it clear that websites with a female voice is read . I created a female festival speaker , but &amp; t@@ aut ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER seems to function not to work . this makes the X@@ SL file to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ but the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate file system filters and now I can go back in &amp; t@@ ts ; do not appear anymore or go back . on the cardboard box orders will be displayed , the order will order only out of a sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
inter@@ section marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ as and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for pro@@ positi@@ onal detection instead .

it is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer which revealed source code . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , voice speed and pitch with &amp; oc@@ t .
you need to install at least one language . help to find the instructions provided with the festival , you need to read the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the dis@@ closure .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; a module for the &amp; control center , which allows the management of network interfaces , the ro@@ uting and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . it can be called by K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to facilitate users the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; control network ; allow for the user a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the module Network Settings ( net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting from k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is shown at all and allows network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices for installing &amp; lin@@ ux ; installed and installed . network appliances later have to be added , the driver must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , accordingly the kernel version .
the Network Settings module is loaded when you select network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network , this platform is automatically recognis@@ able to detect the used platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be detected , the same selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release date is best . due to marking the setting non @-@ re @-@ question the ceremony can be permanently hit . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pres@@ et .
the change of network settings is possible only in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means settings can only be viewed , modi@@ fying changes mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password mode at the right bottom of the module .
in the system management mode , the module &apos;s total functionality is available . this is divided into three riders :
the network interface interfaces can be used to manage network appliances . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out :
select network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . Click to click the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection of automatic , the TCP / IP settings are collected by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address is required for each system start@@ up , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP should be selected according to the system .
selecting the manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP or the TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface in the bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated .
the values are displayed in this dialog as the features of the device in the device @-@ box .
it should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network . ping into the IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping into the &amp; Con@@ sole , you may determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network appliances may be activated or switched on , depending on demand . switching a marked network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
network appliances may be activated or switched on , depending on demand . dis@@ able a activated network device with selecting from the list and click the interface ...
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ stitution .
if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface must be connected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is required to DNS this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the name resolution allows for a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a contract and execution or rec@@ l@@ assi@@ fication in the list with buttons up or down in priority .
clicking button@@ 1 click the button calcul@@ ator to add a DNS server . it will be added to the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button adding . entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group machine to choose the nam@@ ing solution , select one entry and then click on the button Edit . it is displayed in the dialog Edit .
the list known as computer @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boat if no DNS servers are available . in small , enclosed network , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of well @-@ known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some specific IPv6 addresses . this is still in the current version of IP to replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known host and click on adding .... the dialog New alias is displayed .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add . if the famous hosts has several alias name , button adding repeatedly and the other alias names enter .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... The Con@@ tra@@ ded Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , you must set the following command in one &amp; Con@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE are installed and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm , how to install :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic surface such as a package , or the installation tool of its distribution .
the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient for this case , not , but in addition , the development packages begin with libraries and other things .
this is only recommended to use users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given over basic network technology , in the second all are discussed by &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; changed configuration files .
this segment can &apos;t replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is communic@@ ated .
IP networks are currently operating with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . 5 has never seen great spread . IPv6 is expected to prevail in the near future . therefore , this description focuses on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is to as@@ sign to a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; work@@ places is the network administrator to respond to a valid IP address , if available , the IP address can not be selected random@@ ly !
when putting an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address control with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so it &apos;s possible to use it .
of course , access to the Internet can be used for such machines through the setting of Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are commonly used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks to 250 machines .
additionally , the net@@ mask is usually fixed at 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for the IP transfer .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this section the configuration files are listed , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are dis@@ car@@ ded in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered at DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is any other content in the case of active DSL connections .

alternatively , you can click on the variable button on the variable and select copying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to insert an environment variable , first you need to cut out into the cli@@ p@@ board or copied . only then the option inser@@ tion is available at all . select the variables folder . then go to Edit .
to change a variable , select the editing variable . alternatively , you can edit the right mouse button on the variable and change ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It appears then the dialog edit variables , in which , as described above , you can edit the variable .
to delete an environment variable , select the variable first . then go to Edit delete .
to activate or activ@@ ating an environment variable , select it , and place the state with the menu Edit . if enabled , the variable appears down@@ gra@@ yed under description .
alternatively , you can also select the right mouse button on the variable and select the stock . make sure that the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you have to store the cr@@ on@@ tab . select the menu option Save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables will be then active .
it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ die @-@ dialog . if you choose out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog .
print the cr@@ on@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users who own extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ on@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; C@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was to provide a surface for tar containing the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar regarding fast , sel@@ ective explo@@ it@@ ers . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife said : how much longer does it take when you sec@@ ures ?
before a band can be used , it must be numbered from &amp; dated ; it can happen on three ways :
&amp; C@@ dat ; put the band back and reads the advance information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat , the pre@@ acher on the band doesn &apos;t , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat , the pre@@ acher , looking for the appropriate index on your disk . cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked whether the band@@ index should be created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape .
before dis@@ card the tape , the integration process must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; dat ; gives a change in symbol to the band that the binding for the tape was solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted from &amp; dated .
a band type must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use for saving data . this process does not correspond to form@@ atting with &amp; k@@ dat , it must be done before using the volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ atting flo@@ ppy disks are usually a form@@ atting of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives are not .
after entering the band name and capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat , with the form@@ atting of the ban@@ des . all data on the tape are lost ! after the conclusion of the form@@ atting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you &apos;ll need to select the files to be secured . it can happen on three ways :
select one file or a folder in the local file tree . it will only be backed up to this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in local file @-@ tree with a hem@@ or@@ se . only the selected files and / or under@@ min@@ ers are secured .
with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree , and select in the check @-@ out menu ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog can check settings for backup . in this dialogue you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark one file or a folder in one of the archives created in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in one of the archive with a bun@@ k@@ screw . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
right click on the right button in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the test process has been started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder to review .
if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears checking . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process , and the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can recover the re@@ produce , the files must be restored , which can be made in two ways :
select one file or a folder in one of the archives created for the tape drive . it is only restored to the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
select the required files from one of the archives created by one of the files . only the marked files and / or under@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialogue you can check your selection and change the work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialog appears rest@@ oring . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to create the band@@ ed file using the band content . this process involves all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types from the band :
this makes a backup profile with the just selected files and default settings . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
the current working folder , in which the f@@ use is to be made . the list of secured files is automatically updated according to the selected work@@ folder .
for all folders that are listed under the backup files , only the files are listed in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on the same file system , you can enter separately under safety files . each entry is viewed separately from tar regardless of the others .
conduct an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last actu@@ ator Backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files are backed that has since changed since .
the name of the file , which is used for determin@@ ing changes since the last actu@@ ality backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
the settings can be set up via the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be carried out :
the complete path to device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is integrated , the command is attached to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched ON , it is tried and un@@ lock it from the tape drive . possibly , this attitude will not work with all bandwidth drives .
if the option is switched on , the soldering is made of &amp; k@@ dat , automatically cast out the band . don &apos;t use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers .
if the option is switched ON , it is trying to change the hard@@ est block size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you need &amp; c@@ dat , in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; C@@ dat , a band format it is writing a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is audit@@ ory : seconds , whereby the name of the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds left since the period was form@@ at@@ ted in which the band was form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file using the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives who can operate directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar ad@@ minister . even other tar versions should work unless there is no inter@@ rup@@ tions f@@ use .
check the content of a backup association . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for a system protocols . the program is designed for in@@ experienced users where you can get information about your system or where the system can get the different protocol files . additionally , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users provides quick access to information on problems that arise on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . it is a simplified version of the protocol @-@ files of your own system . the program is designed for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users provides rapid access to information on problems that arise on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; hence attempts to provide some extended functions , using certain programs the protocol files can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log has a number of useful functions . among other things , these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included in addition to the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , log &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file can easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start to start &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - to open it . if you don &apos;t have a small news window , you &apos;ll see &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; very likely do not have a system ver@@ wal@@ ter@@ right . the protocol files are normally found in folder / var / log , for normal users normally not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar in order to filter out the filter bar according to a selected crit@@ eri@@ on . in the default setting , the list of the protocol list will be displayed next to the filter record . then , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns containing the filter search term .
you can also select another record , of course , select another record . select the text protocol , then select the column process , and you can also select it in the filter bar the name of a process , so you will show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default and helps to recognise the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of Level error are displayed with a remarkable colour as protocol lines of levels . the colour presentation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched on setup dialog .
if you want to show a certain process ( e.g. in system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can test the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines at the main window menu , in order to display all new addition of the new lines @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows viewing multiple protocol files in separate sign@@ posts . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ window . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has a website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also available in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; im &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it quickly developed as the standard for the control of the start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is why it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it either : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is why someone might try to setup a machine on system V in@@ it without installing a re@@ installing and re @-@ form@@ atting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there .
SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD input , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc , instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service , which you want to restart the system or change to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial / etc . these calls include according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie in part under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not have a lot of use for it . you can also create r@@ c.@@ co.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run out something , what to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can change to / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a bit passed through , then you will rep@@ airing it by restart the system and run the following :
but how does it start with all the correct scripts ? if you can -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? simply : each of the scripts is written so that it &apos;s an argument as start@@ up and stop . you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if that includes a K , the script will stop using the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will be called by the argument .
some people wish you a simple way to al@@ ign machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run @-@ level , that can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . moreover , I could have a user -@@ Run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it ( or stop ) .
you can shift scripts between Run@@ lev@@ elling or shift the position within one level by changing it elsewhere . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or his position ) . this happens only if they move an entry from the dispos@@ ition of available system services .
note : entries are moved , if you prefer this into a new area . to just copy it onto a new run@@ level , you must select explicitly copy from the menu Edit menu and in the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sorting number can sometimes be calculated sometimes . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle . be careful .
you can use the t@@ ulator button to enable the various working ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection below or below the previous .
to move an entry in another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change sorting number or the name of one entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . connect the dialog by ref@@ utes the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are re@@ produced by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ elling , and now the machine re@@ starts constantly . what can I do ?
put the li@@ lo Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the species , as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary components of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an expansion of the program for this approach .
in case you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are required ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without notice if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; to user ; 1.0 . you can manage the users and groups of your system using this program .
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have done any changes , you have to save this . either you are using the corresponding icon of tool@@ bar or the entry in the file .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , user and user group list . for Edit , select the desired user or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics .
some flash@@ cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you can make extended system settings . only if you can make custom constra@@ ints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will be able to make individual settings . further flash@@ cards appear if Shadow -@@ passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ forms .
the card passport control appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ forms .
this cartridge card is only activated and initi@@ alized for at least one @-@ inserted fil@@ esystem ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable in the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , each user can change parameters , with the limitation of information in KB are :
these parameters can be set separately for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field @-@ restriction field system .
the ant@@ it@@ ant@@ card groups inform@@ s about the group inher@@ itors of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , find in the binary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by mark this in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users to add a user to group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select the user or group or click on the appropriate Add button on the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group as anal@@ og@@ ous .
with this module you can add the li@@ lo @-@ boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , change and more .
