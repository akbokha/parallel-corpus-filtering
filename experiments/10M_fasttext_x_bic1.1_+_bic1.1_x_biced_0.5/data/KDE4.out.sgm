<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Conqueror; displays another view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various tooling and text-views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The specificity of & FSView; consists in it, screed folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the capacity of the size of subordinated objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a file or a folder represents the size of a file or a folder. in this way, large files can be easily identified if they can be seen far below in the file hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap depicts a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the right corner of meaningful use and labeling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched on display color mode, may be either deepening for the light detection of the screw depth, or the figure of other file size, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various features of the corresponding file or the folder. for each feature, you can define if enough space is available, or whether the surface of subordinated rectangles is present (whereby the values of subordination occur due to the character of the Treemap). in addition, you can designate the relative position of labelling in rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">Regarding lifting algorithms, the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always marked for setting up the entries must not be available, which is then square to the suborderly entries, when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the area of an entry for the subordinated entries, the implementation is left up. it is advisable for the labelling and avoidance of space losses through frames can be created, which are square as possible. the best methods of this regarding lines, columns or recursive confusion.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry view. instead, a voice pattern is drawn into the area of the above-level entry, to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub-designated entry.</seg>

<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & KDE; programs is also & digious; an open source project. this means, it is on supporting the enrollers. you should therefore report problems and improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digious; try to make the milking of problems or suggestions for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help Menu contains an entry problems or wishes. if you are using this link, your web browser doesn't open a page in error messages. all required information are already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digious; is a project supported by a community. i.e., users and developers are able to help each other. if you have a regular users of & digious; ask here questions to other users of & digious; ask yourself some questions to other users. in this mailinglist, however, you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digious site; please visit news about shared versions and other information about & digious; to know.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digious; registration is included in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digious;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you get & digious; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database. you can enter here a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter your name, or click the folder icon folder order to select folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here your data is stored. this path remains equal to any image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add so many folders such as you would like to add. & digious; additionally you will use as an Albenlibrary. settings digibox set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have an image collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, which contains images as base folder. & digious; viewed every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during the search of the folder you will get a progress indicator show how to see this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digious; durations come true for the librarian fad in its whole depth. you can't lock the subfolder, unless you take off & digious file; do you take a point in front of the name of the sub-folder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take a existing folder with photos as basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList will have no pictures as symbols. you can change this as a random photo from the album and this is used as an album icon. for more details, you will find in the albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you configured the base file, you can set up your digital camera. afterwards, you should learn how to use my albums and my sample box to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can handle it; possibly the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported resource cameras in the Help of RohkameraHelp.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to setup and work with raw files is described in the Sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh-Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera agency is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly into & digious; of course more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and any card reader, supported by your operating system, is supported by & digious; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are used by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera can then be realized via the Picture transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras can also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digious; the program gPhoto2 is used to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, further-able software collection for digital cameras, which has been constantly developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of pictures from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras are using the serial interface for their communication with the machine. as photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port, this connection is now obsolete. & digious; supports these cameras and runs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. you can find a complete list of supported cameras under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support. EXIF support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera drivers. if the EXIF support is not present in libcphoto2, you may seem to see any outward pictures or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things of & digious; is how easy the functionality should be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image Plugins Interface Project (Handbook) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digious;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg. and Gwena. goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digious; by writing a small module to complement one function, than the changes in & digious; themselves perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either change the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Pulling and dismantling pictures works everywhere: you can store an image in another part of the Albenbauma, above the horizontal separation line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture is not stored in keywords, date list, or search.</seg>

<seg id="89">Album- collections: are a method to mark your albums so you can select below a common name. if you're using the collection, you'll need to sort or delete records by collection. if you want to add new collections or want to extinguish you, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: used to sort your albums after date with view albums after date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons eldest, average, the latest: these set the date on the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. in this case, first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information, instead, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first enter an album in & digious; it will be selected the first picture in the album as a symbol for the & quot; my Albenlistequot; this is why the first photo in the album is not representative and you might then choose another photo as a symbol.</seg>

<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you need to setup your system structure in contrast to the data structure. you need to decide whether other access to your photos should be saved, whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. note that you need to switch it to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found fast about your location. if you were enough photos on the same place. if you're able to make enough photos, then you will use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a web site.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant access from pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% of work files will have and you will not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. disconnect new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata in the installation page of metadata in & digious; it ensures that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can restart the metadata from the database into the files by choosing the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? and, & digious, a metadata Editor for a number of selected attribute settings are available. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should select each photo keywords, inscriptions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all pictures, which need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keyword, key words, as you are running in other programs common, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import cataloged images from another source with embedded stitutes, then & digious; automatically insert the tree for you or attach the pictures to the correct place. the conversion of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply by removing a sub-tree to one another. the changed keywords will be followed by & digious; updated while the subtrees are traced.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is over. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to certificates or comments using the third most important tool for your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want most niers to see your photos easily, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your pictures arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then start some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this is the landing field of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachometer; in French Normandy: 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical time span is once again present, you may even hear the silence. so the lettering has changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others consider the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning to the viewer, to help Him about the motive that she has moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect when it is the strength only to work with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious; you can store any text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures simultaneously. KDE is even exported to your wishes for your wishes and / or the title of Web-gallery system. so, you have to tell the story for opening up any second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet on GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train learns the spatial presentation now with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolocation are already countless and become even deeper into the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future you can open your travels. you can also export the pictures at the recording location. you can also export the pictures on the recording location. you can also export the pictures as well as Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copyright to remove limitations on distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says which information in the setup page of & digious; as information stored should:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for narrator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer, for example, if it wasn't checked, the name of a company or organization can be used. after this value, it should not be changed. this field does not support Comma nor Semicolons as separating characters.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autotitel (Synonym for Constitutions): linked to the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples of this field contains the title as: employee photographer, Freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a mersion to the car field, this must be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the anbideterfeld to identify who you see. if the photographer has been listed here as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations cannot be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then here the group / Agency is listed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. each of which is a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calculator, it can only delete a digital water mark. for individuals and Halb professionals this protection is very important to it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is once unique. & digious; in the near future, it will provide a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, record power, power surges, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterevasion, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs on the road or a fire. this type of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics, which has a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs must be careful to fight this cautiously and you may not get more expensive than a few years. of course you can also hold CDs and DVDs in archive quality. there are offers about Gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 a piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you think it's in your surveying game.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discos and good recording sessions and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you can use much reliable. therefore, it is the right to choose the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you were just written. therefore, use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and control unit. despite this massive protection it requires chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a reasonable program called IsoBuster, which runs for Windows and Linux; but is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged floppies, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to be able to win the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus nearly six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was said to CDs and DVDs, of course, also applies to Blu-ray discs.</seg>
<seg id="185">Keep up slowly with a good recording device to high quality media in a non-propriated format. read the media with a description, date & author's mark and afterwards in a clean, dark dry and in animals protected place. don't forget to read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floats reserve their statistics for itself. their manufacturers warranty include a new disk, but not the data. Google puts on this subject a major field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives: dismissing detectors</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief, Disks keep the longest if you operate in the temperature range between 35 ° C and 45 ° C. at lower temperature control, the most common error of errors are the most frequently forthcoming failure. these are especially reprobable and publishing storytellers. the expected lifetime of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is a complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to an electricity loss before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be produced without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances do not make a lot of equipment, these anomalies can take these anomalies with computer chips and high speed processes. these anomalies can cause severe loss, hardware age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so, protect yourself from the inevitable that causes a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against blackspikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of energy saving. it is usually available in the form of a slot bar. however, remember that not any plug-bar also contains a power supply protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage safety, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum protection. you should also ensure that it offers protection against lightening strikes and thus protecting the right devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since you can use an overvoltage every cable to your computer, you should pay attention that all peripherals can also be connected to your system. some manufacturers are also able to provide a phone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable transition protection. a multitude of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore you are also very small and you also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection system protects your system before smaller fluctuations in power lines, it will not really help you in a complete loss. even a few seconds may lead to loss of intolerable data. therefore, it can be sensible to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides protection from overvoltage grips, these devices can automatically shut down battery energy when a power loss occurs. this gives you the possibility to keep your data back up to the current. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like a overvoltage safety. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in power disorders with the cost of avoidance of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think. finally, you should always remember all cables before going on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy Storage Service. with the right configuration you can use this as drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destinations for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offering to store any data stored.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. furthermore, you need to send data on comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable for a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a poor solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo community 23hq.com are available online storage services that are available on photos stored. your professional version is more available to you, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 a year you'll get unlimited memory, which should be checked into reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">Data protection from the point of view are the web solutions very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted for adjusting to the TCP protocol and included in the big companies offer a backup and a distributed memory. therewith, they are deserving.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system zfs and btrfs reflect at least the data integral between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says you if a transmission error occurred, not when it was destroyed in your hardware. all this disturbances remain undiscovered until you have no protection to your computer. nobody seems to have thought it in your computer. nobody seems ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly more secure data path than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable grid parts are a further source of transmission ratio because they generate intermediaries within the data streams. at normal filesystem, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not concerned about transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate failed and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope to see it for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that used and is also available for Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate these two factors! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook & 46% for worktop systems. Notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of the most. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; for long no longer sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, just the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if however, a file is not completely stored before the problem arises, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main cause of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continued to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and narcological characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deteriorating. even DSLR cameras have a 10-12 megapixel sensor. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk get you today for 100 & euro; so do not make any other responsible for data loss. thus, make your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you do anything more dangerous than the re-installation of your operating system, make the exchange of disks or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you are daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash, you will be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accident, fire, water, electricity, children and theft release are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desastervorous therefore means not a local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighbouring home, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a more common reason for a loss of data loss despite ensuring the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files are to be secured. it is a moment of history without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Prevention: a backup of files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete moment of moment at two time points: completion and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Increative backup: a backup of files that have been changed since the last backup. produced several moments. you can restore the original status at any time back to one such backup. this fuse comes to a versioning system next with the exception that it is only fasted and not continuously running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool which you can easily setup your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer Scripts rsync only the difference of files that really have been changed. this happens, and if you want to increase security about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD, or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover and restore us. at the same time, you come back for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of work files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment of time for at least one month and a moment of moment for every month. each other dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC information, equated XMP files, original memory, memory, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is about the time span in which you really interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider and reassess the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to let yourself as the current system backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered using the explanations in this document. use and switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then store it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, store and locking technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expert pressure for the opportunity to change a system in its size. this really means amplify.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go that you have set the scalability with the plans and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and lay it onto a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd f = / dev / SDB [#] of = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBLE; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can read it, then you can create this yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is loss-free, supported by XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata. PNG can require a relative amount of administration reports, but not as many as TIFF, but not as many as TIFF, and we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression level (Deflate). however, it is managed to store your pictures in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a license-free and open resource format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers is currently available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. file information is used with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers draw it in front of an original recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive the metadata is specified separately from the image file. it can also be noted on the link between the metadata and the image file and as mentioned above, you should think about whether you're using DNG as containers and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application purposes and business models. the activities of DCMI belongs to the activities of architecture and modelling, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds and connaissance efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata ards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures are based on the camera, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine processing, you can use external programs. if you come back with & digious, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off under any circumstances from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export it into Webgaleries, code in MPEG, please print in contact page, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digious. in the section adding a photos to an album you can add a description of how you have already installed on your hard drive, but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing photos to your album bench.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digious; connect these with the machine, turn on the camera to the display mode and turn on them. another description is available in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to last with your camera. if the connection is manufactured, a fermentation indicator appears at the bottom and show images of all photos on the camera. if this is the case, file names will appear, and a symbol for the file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information about every entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of a entry or his metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows the file properties and the photo information that are stored on the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer. note that there are not all information available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturing tooling, GPS etc of the image. this information is the same as the metadata page bar from the main window of & digious; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in & digious; for downloading the photos were not deleted, and we will be sure to retrieve the pictures directly into an album before you delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the default optional options of & KDE. once you select the pictures you can download and then selected the button. the button selected can be stretched out until you've selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new download option is available. these pictures have been downloaded from & digious; download. in this case, the new pictures are downloaded with a star in advance windows. if you choose this option, of course, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons all of you download or selected files, a dialogue with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are sorted. details of the existing albums are sorted, as usual folder you can follow in section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digious; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all the button once you want to delete all the button. if you want to delete only some, you must first select this first and then delete files.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to restore photos from the camera. so the photos will not be deleted in the trash & KDE; so they should be completely deleted. if you want to delete the camera system completely before you want to delete the camera limit, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful. this can run into a double filename if you upload photos of different recording criteria into the same album. therefore, it may be useful, the date and the time when the image was made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the picture and for data bases. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer opens three additional options to be performed before the photos on the record are stored on the record. if you select this, the corresponding entries of the EXIF information is copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to read another file format as the standard format, you can add the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. then turn the option to date and time. for more customizations you should read the command strautime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the possibility to change filenames in small case letters. or if you prefer, if you prefer this option.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digious file; for a photo is used underneath the name that the camera is available in the preview of the name. your settings can be stored and automatically, when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious; can use any information on the camera's orientation of the camera to perform automatic turning during the shut-up time. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has been embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turning is normally switched on, and if your camera does not provide this information, take the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn out the automatic rotation, use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the lower section of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera offers information on the date that the photo was made available, it can take & digious; this substrate is based on the image data. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same Subtitled. not all cameras are available in the same subalbum. in the section page sidebar meta data, you can follow what information about your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores & digious; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the Advanced button and select the date of date-based substrate at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their machine to your camera is the button to download. then select upload. the file extension dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files that are uploaded to you. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, asks & digious; you, where the pictures are to be uploaded. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload, and the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position that can be displayed in length and latitude. identifying the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional Photographers can link it an image with a precise geographical spot. not everyone uses an airplane to take an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot where the photo was done, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digious; users who want to localize the place of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to add to the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how come the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that exiv2 are supported many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card references. there are at least three ways to reach this. directly with the right hardware, via a reworking of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographic allocation (manual) and last about the manual input of well known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. however, there are a couple who work with GPS receivers together. either as a card module or transmitting the data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">The download of GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, however, this data must be stored in the GPX format as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from GPS. on the following page, you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exifl by Phil Harvey. it uses the signalling code that will be created for example maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains how shown below, the standardidentarity and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the corresponding IPTC data fields, even when the option is selected from the camera's camera system. this data is also written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autocitel is a synonym for the editor: this field should contain the name of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author, it must be filled also.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for suppliers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have the author, as such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here as this is the picture of any other & quot; or offers quot;. if the picture is a stock picture, then the group or agency should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC promotions will save the data into the appropriate IPTC market. this metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digious; this metadata is also available for other programs and can be imported in & digious; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you may add to your photos, with the images embedded in the pictures. this allows you to inscribed your inscriptions as well. warning: in pictures which already labeled messages are overwritten by the & digious; overwritten.</seg>

<seg id="291">& # 160; digious; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to determine which file types & digious; to be fixed, you can add the extension of this list and remove any file in a & digious; Albumfolder, which has no such extensions, ignored by & digious; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset, by pressing the button Refresh right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the ceiling of & digious; can be set on this page to the default values. however, if you can open the illuminated mode. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can only get any more stimulus. if you have one, then you can get a better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, editing takes a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this one here. you can adjust the toolbar when you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or light colour in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing can be set off with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, the pictures are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia to the higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG-compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation reduces the image quality because PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means a low and 9 means a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF-files option, you can switch the default value compression level for TIFF-pictures. this reduces the size of TIFF-pictures. it has no influence on the image quality because the default-level algorithm has been loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you have been written the loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata was not yet supported yet, but in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digious, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs. currently it is very fast to develop a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default imitate is that all green pixels are the same. if you use an odd-to-ultraviolet light when using this option, you solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option records this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option shows the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 gain with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the Weißer is using the camera. otherwise, if set, automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a fixed colour balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji super CCD SLR cameras. by using the second sensors, the effect has the effect that exposed photos in four steps more details in the tops. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the peak beam, so the parts of your pictures are burned to the peak of your camera, as long as going through to the inability of your camera. you can solve the setting in various Rosatönen. finally, you can try some parts of missing information from the shlichés.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible, as blue pixels could not be filled as quickly as green and red. & digious; and dcraw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how many color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">Selecting the option reconstruct, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise, and / should therefore be adapted for each image separately.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminous value to your taste. you probably have to put it somewhat higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of & digious; -image processing will be done. in order to keep the time for the demosgene, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-based algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial data image that will have many cameras and which is a matrix-colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digious; and Dcraw make you three alternatives to you: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. according to some tests, it was used as if AHD interpolation was used (for adaptive Homogeneity photographs), but it was used as if AHD interpolation was used (for adaptive homogeneity). however, it produces color photos to the edges. Bilinear is interesting, if you're looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour variance of your lenses, you can set the rotor and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for colouring correction, as it is carried out during the extraction.</seg>
<seg id="312">One profile translates the color information and returns as this again. there are also loCMS and & digious; information such as color information from a colour space in the other are to translate the colors as exactly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior issues, when a picture is opened in image processing / colour management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you all put up all your profiles. & digious; investigated this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard deposit; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. only your pictures are colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input file should fit to the camera equipment and model you can use. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain any colour mapping or gamemcorrection. this is currently corrected dcraw gamma not for conversions with 16 bit depth. this means you need to conduct the colour mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the soft profile profile, which you can emulate how your printer might be given back as your printer. this is very useful before you print picture, because your printer has a smaller colour range than your camera and some colours are therefore very satisfied, instead of switching to the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them for what is intended for. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this response is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon extension extension makes the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & KDE; image viewer and image editing; many modules support, which were written to cooperate with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules that you want to use, and these modules will be downloaded as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set up in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals for the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The diaschau settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusted the time between the image outputs, usually it is 4-5 seconds good. the other input fields turn the metadata a or out, which appears at the bottom end of the pictures during display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics are shown on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection that is connected to a camera that is connected to the computer. among them are the port settings. currently, here Serial, USB- and USB / FireWire-memory is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you select a USB- or FireWire-mass storage camera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / notice that you hang on your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digious, you need to connect to your computer with your computer to display and activate them in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digious; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option to confirm confirmation of &gt; images in the Mülleimer, you can set the conversation of & digious; in the deleting of a photos in an album you can find a photos and deletion of a album you find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes via the right side bar can be tactically sealed by & digious; if you use the option to use changes in the right sidebar, otherwise you will need to apply the changes with the button change.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also attach the display of the digious parasol of & digious; for starting subtypes, this accelerates the start process of & digious.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting of the Start After new photos are forcing & digious; the base file moved to new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the starting time of & digious; then, when something came from the base folder, asks & digious; you see if it should delete it out of the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various colorings can be placed in & digious; used to adapt the main window to your taste. you can select these settings from the tool bar. a preview of available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digious; to create, find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digious; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view and modify your photos and improve image processing can be launched by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by the context menu of the entry and selection of entry display / edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digious; therefore, you are not part of your distribution. more information on the KIPI modules are available in section Pictures.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the lower edge of the window, the filename, current data number, magnifying factor and the current picture size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top margin, including the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of picture editing will change your photos. however, there is no power to change the original photo before you save the file Save or the button stores from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have stored the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So, you should be able to setup a copy of your image before you change it. you can save you with file Save as possible.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't have stored the photo, you can restore the original picture by using the edit or button the button to restore the image processing, restore any changes that you have done on the photo since the last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every promotion of the image processing can be reversed or re-manufactured. the last promotion can be reversed by using editing editing and select editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make sure to restore the key combination file, Ctrl; z for backward and Ctrl; -Turn-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; you can press the backbone or re-button in the toolbar a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you've started image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture rbelow or the entries in the menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo in and out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse bike or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the sizing menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can also use this button in the toolbar: enlargement factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Picture displays the photo in full screen mode. you will come to the normal view, where you don't want to change the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can change this in the setup dialog box & digious; you can view this from the & digious window. see the section to set up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print images and get the default & KDE; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">Out of the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sets. you only need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album Export Manager. if you follow the wizard you will only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digious; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, the important information and actions available for the selected pictures. the same page bar is available, without the navigation tubes, also available in the image processing, and it will be displayed if one of the five riders will be clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Click multiple times on the same rider leaves the sidebar and disappear again in the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the lettering view, you can insert or add labelling with unlimited size. note: the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After speaking, you can use either the button on the user or simply switch to the next image, the inscriptions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. but you can also write the metadata in the files. this is always done when you select a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The assessment determines a score of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either by a single click on the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation from the page bar is always applied only to a picture. to evaluate more pictures at the same time, select this from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with previously mentioned in this & digious; session used.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword-tree is adjusted dynamically to the selected search word. you can easily limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief at the typing of the sample rate in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set through markings the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main window and select a keyword in the keyword, this only applies to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, If you want to have a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The lateral bars keyword is used to change the selection of displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their record, - file, keyword and search results. if in addition, one or more sample filter from the right side is used, only the chiding of these two is displayed. all displayed keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull and pull off. if the keyword already exists, you can simply move with reference. if the keyword already exists, you can easily put it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. subsequently, a dialogue that you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window indicates the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is based on three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right-word-tree is drawn into the selection and there, a dialogue asked if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be turned off using settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created it and notice that it should be a or must be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry I was looking for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can select a Advanced search via all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to type options, just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. see the options then as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited there to 1 GB and you will not want to save images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this job. I have mostly adapted to & digious; s more specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you set a color-administered workflow is that the colors of your camera or scanner can reach a predictable deviation from the really photographed or scanned colors. you can print out the colors on your monitor using your camera or scanner and the colours which you print out of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone should know what buttons he must press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial will make you provide sufficient background information about color management. additionally, you should make links with deeper information enabling you to make the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows are fulfilled every six below criteria, you do not need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by e-mail or web, where the RGB the de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So, if sRGB works so well and the life for everyone makes it easy, why should I use another colour space and have to worry about color breaks?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in contrast to the colors we can really see below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenshaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger farms, please visit Bruce Lindbloom excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I decided to work in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you work in the sRGB-color space or not, you have to install your monitor because it's RGB to sRGB, so you have to use your monitor to the RGB values of sRGB, then you have to use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that may improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before using a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The capabilities normalize, unequal, automation and contrast extend from the menu Correcise Automatical correction automatically try to make the best. you will be experimenting with these effects, to see which appears the best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled through the whole picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its colour shadows. this feature is often a magical correcting for pictures the dark or well-grown.</seg>
<seg id="391">Unequal: this method is adjusted to adjust the illuminant protection of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of intensity of the picture is as flat as possible. in this way, the result is very good results in the improvement of a picture, sometimes produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic control: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjustment of the red, green and blue channels across the entire history of histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extended: this method improves the contrast and the brightness of the RGB values of a picture by postpone the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible range and a rejib of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The Weißabequals from & digious; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white abbot of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance is something limited since about a colour space with 8-bit per colour is worked. if you are now too far from the original image, areas with oversupply can occur. if you work the white, in the 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction shall be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance of white, the copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you can launch it via the menu entry color white immediately of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original image as well as the preview of the target is adapted. if you want to see the original whitening immediately, it is enough to click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red markers. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right there will be a histogram that dynamically changes once you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in good illuminated images, most pixels are very small Luminous values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustments will enhance the shadow details of your photos or also dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Up with the controls mentioned above, you should use the colour temperature Pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use the color temperature of the white comparison. in this way, the temperature and green values are also set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator provides the colours when more than a colour channel of the Pixels is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance sheet. this will appear in a preview of pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons stores as and store exactly this. any setting of the cup you have set to store with a text file and re-charge later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings presets all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white cover. note that even neutral settings are displayed another photo than your original. if you save this save your original image.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code depth for each color channel of the processed picture. 8-bit coding is better for high quality images. this coding is also needed for high quality images, but this coding is also required for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles. colour tonmapping can be carried out by the subwindow for your helmets. a detailed manual for the use of colour profiles can draw you to the chapter of color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and therefore always need the same corrections. in the manual for sound value correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool to gradation that you will find gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious tool gives you four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, a effect of the picture was completed. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopapier from the extra light. this had the effect that the brighter areas of dark and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">Intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemically possible is possible. a further increase was created and finally a negative picture that does not produce photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar thermal effect. the original image is the (1), and that is edited (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation because he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an optimized colour film which is produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure. Veldas strongly managed to make him a film of choice for wildlife photographers. Velvias strongly offers a few photographs of which the little landscapes are given, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">Neon filters simulates neonlight to the contrasts. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeatings generate the strength of the neonlight. in large pictures, the filter can hold the entire CPU for one moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it's not unusual you want to fix the colour conjunctions and the brightness of the photos. you can see the different color effects of your photos with the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo at bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too big satiation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to increase your saturation instead. all changes you can carry out in the preview. if Him like this, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple candy strength / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve exposure time. even if the dialog becomes very complicated to improve the application, you need only the area of the slider. more specifically the three slides below the histograms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph there are three sliders in the inside and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move regulators and make sure how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, updated from the image of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scale: with this selection box can be adjusted whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram of a single pillar will contain the linear histogram of a single column. in this case, the logarithmic agreement is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for middle tones, frequently called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colorallets can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadow, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area. here, there are also two controllers can be used to evaluate the output values. for example, the compression of output values can be used as background, while doing something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set automatically depending on the picture value of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store as and store: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reloaded later. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted to all shadows, means and sun sets. enable the color value to set the histories of the histoprogram for red, green, blue and luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed sediator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is with (1) and the corrected figure with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview can be updated dynamically in depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification Channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel, which is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to change between a linear and logarithmic view. usually the linear mode of sensual mode is usually created. for pictures with large areas of constant colour the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a cventing to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright notes correspond with dark output stages, and the corresponding image size is darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking can be seen. if you want to change this marker on the curve, a fitting line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it to and off until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve can be created with this file system. file format is the Gimp Kurvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color boxes, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun-tones. enable the color pipette to use and click on the original pattern to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed sediator controls all color channels in order to display exposed pixels. if in more than one channel over exposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is a indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance canal. shadow and sun tones have been applied with the color pipette and applied to curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer der & digious; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels, or to change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix colour shades of images. you can edit it from the color-mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optional box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by correct the relative distribution and rash. the left section of the window indicates you a preview of: the original can be viewed as comparison of your own riders.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red markers. if you move this in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to display the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to keep this channels. if you do Luminance, the picture is particularly convenient if you are also able to activate the appropriate color components as the channel mixer then is the tool used to generate great black-and-white conversions. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour is coming to a visible space that occurs on the same spot in the color channel and whose colour sample looks different in each channel. if this is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion, which you can reduce the farbrauschen.</seg>
<seg id="447">Store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any sound mixer allows you to save and then load it. this used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed sediator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is adjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is below (1) and the processed picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, as color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film with a green lens filter. this looks great, with all the scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of heaven. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange film: simulates a black / white film with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. similar to like the 002 Cokin (TM) Oranter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red Filter: simulates a black / white film with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic effects of heaven and can simulate moon phases on the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour of color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium sounds as it adds a little cold in the shakes. this is very similar to the trial of a pressure and the restart in a septic goons. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digious tool; use texture texture. you can use decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your picture regardless of whether it's a color image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on canvas, the style of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the depth and depth of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textile effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digious tool box, a decorative frame can be added to a picture added.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an amount to keep in the boundaries of a photos is no easy task. it is a possibility to keep his attention to the image. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under the frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your picture. the image with a colored line, Niepce ascends it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and white images) with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button and decoratively adding an ornamental pattern with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of the frame in percent. the range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with the frame table will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the pressure of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple formatted text into a picture in any place. this also includes several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text format, orientation, color from the colour space and the character set with its properties, the bigger the picture, the bigger the character set must be. finally, simply select an frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any attitude you have chosen for your text may be changed until you hit the button "OK" and after the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digious tool; tool stencil to use a template about a painting.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image templates apply in image processing can be used to put templates over a painting.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there is no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should be adding with maximum compressing (9) to remove the file size. if you want to add your Templates of the & digious; template list digious-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">To use this tool for the first time you need to set your Template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder you have copied the template file. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the template has been given a tree view which reflects the folder structure of the template's folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the unmanners of the template.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview, three buttons are available with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button rotates the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Size reduction: this button reduced the lower image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to use the template on the whole image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Please use OK if you want to use the template on your image. the image will be adjusted automatically to the front size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious; presents three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces particularly in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">The sharper mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. indeed, it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokusus is probably the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. he is a bit more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalised pictures require an correction of the sharpness. thus, elements are smaller than the resolution, so that the sharp edges are made up to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more retrofitted than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures has often been used to have applied internal sharpening. images in the rough format must always be tightened in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn out an sharpening process already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will receive your control over your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening workload. you can sharpening it with the menu entry level sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful because the results are not very natural: sharpening raises the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the rushing. in general, the useful technique increases the sharpness of one image the tool Refokusus. you can find it via the menu entry emrigusus. you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw a little soft is much simpler than it. use the tool to soften using the menu entry corrosion, and experiment somewhat with settings. the show window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is sharp masked is a very good tool to remove the veil of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help you edit the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should first be tried out. an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the wrong mask to make strong, noise and impression of grats will create in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filters on each side of an edge through the filters. high resolution images allow larger radii. they should therefore sharpen pictures of the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignorant picture, which is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the reference amount. you can therefore define a minimum difference in order to define an edge of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft shift between tones are exempt and therefore the beauty errors in faces, heavens and water surface are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture the (2). unsharp masked was applied using radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious tool refocus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected Unloading filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocsierquot; this is better approach as only trying to sharpening the photo. it uses a technique to sharpening pictures is the use of a nonsharpness. Refokusus usually takes better results than inwarmed. you can start from the menu by shooting colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular patch works much better than the Gauge's folding, which leads far from the source pixies that are far from the original torpixel size. the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauge's Foot will even be influenced considerably by distant pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular plugs. it is the main parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value of 1 good results will result. you can set a higher value if your picture should be very unsharp, but then on halves.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0,1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value is still pliable to the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of transformational atrix. however, an increase in matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select big values for the circular sharpness or Gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select major values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any pitch parameters you have set will be stored for later and then can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity correction on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compress pictures, and eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module on the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masked better results than sharpening. this might be caused by which unsharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to create unsharp masked artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be removed the effect of the nonsharpness. for the Viennese filter you can show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practical is the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the rough mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters on a small focused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original color image that has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpening correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob level makes the sharpest part of the area, in order to create a naturally more natural pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The tinker allows a customized paint for the Pupille. if you want to keep blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool calculator is one of the most developed tools developed to remove non-specific artifacts with unprecedented velocity.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS label in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several default settings as Starpoints, to simplify the restoration. the settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can also use the riders smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass deposit over the image. a value of 0.9 should get more details so that no sharpening is needed. please note that the details should always be subordinated to the direction of direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Accuracy dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smooths evenly across all directions, while a value close to 1 can be observed in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise, a high value of walled samples will produce a high value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flattening [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor about alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, put this value to the degree of noise in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is related to larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it becomes more difficult, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm will pass through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">The anisotropic Alpha [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles do have a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length. you should lower the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never get bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">If you want to use linear interpolation: this option is only low. however, it doubles the duration. however, we recommend it to expose it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons store as and store make exactly this. correct setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Picture errors is comparatively very quick at work. however, it can last for a long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demolition.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how image errors can be removed from small artifacts. this module is applied on a photo that has been produced in Guatemala city with an analog camera. the original pattern is shown below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digious; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce frame exchange. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter tails.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable picture filters to remove patches and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects from encapped pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about the sensor noise cameras, you can read it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain-noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the bottom line advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checked the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. major values increase the time that filter per pixel requires and can be administered through the radius of the radius of the image and the colour in it is smoother and thus smaller mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets out the pixel pitch. if it is increased, noise tips are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details may not get more and noise or smelling occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it can be too strong, not the whole noise can be removed or rattachers can occur. put it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that will be controlled by details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we encourage you to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that will be controlled by details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of the dark areas, which are typically more stronger than to increase. he also wormated the shadow zones.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phasenjittering absorption. if it is increased, the edges of the adaptive filter radius will occur on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, rushing and phasenjitter appear along the edges. it can remove rougher and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the file system and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction may change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution is a bit soft to draw, fortunately much simpler than a picture. use the tooltip with the menu entry Correct softly and experiment with the glare. the picture window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation to your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digious; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo files.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts of your images. it is very well adapted to immerse Gauß's room, filmmakers, cratzer, compression file extensions and local errors associated with image contours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the texture of texture is performed with another tool, the algorithm for restoration. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS label in Caen / Franningham and is part of the CImg Project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts Reduce JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compression manure, it creates some compressions & quot; Artefakefquot; - small standards that are in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these issues.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons store as and store make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with a formal noise; the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded using a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie grain on the faces. the original image is below (1) and this corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below, you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo created with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that have been created by scanning lighting and the photo apier. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious, tool Hotpixel allows the hotpixel size of photos that have been made with a CCD camera, eight have to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels represent a problem at high quality raw mode photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; name Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtracing method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button darkening. the tool will detect automatic hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to connect the dark screen directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First described as described in the previous section, you should find the appropriate dark screen to the correct picture. note here that the wizard will notice the final dark screen and automatically recharges it in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and preview help you correct within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all stages.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the faulty pixels in the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpoll these pixel blocks. these are the available filters below:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: there is an average of the neighbouring pixel size. the resulting colour is assigned to all defects pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical lines.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels which have a distance from 1 pixel block, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (1-dim) or a group of linear bends (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel can be drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square bends (1-dim) which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a colour photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original picture was enlarged by 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. below corners to correct the image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially the in the medium and large photo format, can often do not evenly illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that the sensor can be reached there. teleobjects below circumstances also demonstrate this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the blending filter which means it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be able, also with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, since otherwise unsharpened effects arise through movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">Using the big exposure areas of today's filters and colour scanner and video scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a cate filter by simulating a equivalent transformation on a shell image that has been made without these filters. the tool of Vignetting correction is applied to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three additional exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light output absorption at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, or by chance to compensate a density of 2, despricht.Increase the density by a larger degree of Vignetting to compensate it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstrength, Contrast and Gamma -settings: the processing of a picture with the Vignetting correction reduces the illuminating thickness of the pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options. the controllers represent only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re adjustment of exposure of the target picture, let the values for brightness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use gradation from the & digious menu; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) to correct picture. a static and contrast ratio was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious; lenticular distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortion. color distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct concave or constripe form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar balance effect, but flap to the edges. this correcting is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the grader corrects the remote corners to the opposite vertices. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second grazing. with negative values can be corrected a ton-shaped distortion and detect positive values.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the distortion. this value affects more than in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameters has the reverse sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value, the image size is new and performs a correction first degree. negative values increase the size reduction in the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightly: this value adjustment brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values it increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview of distortion correct. the values that you use for your image will be stored and the next start is used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tanning and caustic correction should be carried out in front of all the cutting or size changes. the best way to cut this correction as all the first. if you have to cut a picture newly and then create a ton-shaped correction it would be the effect of the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction you can find a vertical and horizontal aid line to you. move it to an important place, such as the seashore, or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this place. in the following, you can correct the tonne / cold-shaped distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a correct distortion part, the resulting image will have black corners. you can easily remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformation or cross the control knob of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most of the pictures a ton-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as photos of front, frames and paintings are the perspective so to correct the all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a ton-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film, which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview of the window. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can simulate two parameters set up movie screens and filmensitivity (ISO). enable the option to simulate films from a highly sensitive film. the ISO controllers changes the amount of filmmaking and predominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filters color channels to produce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, because the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filming applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the illustrated image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the lace.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious; filter filmmaking is an easy-to-use tool for producing filmmaking on your images. this is known by classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, well known to increase the sensitivity of the movies.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filmmakers effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere loosened from daily life. if you want this special, gallery-like, photographic photographic, grained view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the body weight. the default value is, although rather higher levels need to use at ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of a film coating effect on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1), and that worked (2). the used hypersensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil paintings. natural images and style are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. top of the top chooses the pinpoint between one and five. thicker brush are better suitable for large pictures. flattening controls the glare or, from the other side view, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original pattern is marked with the (1) and this is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and Glare 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter charcoal drawing used color and intensity gradient to create a coal mine. images whose gradient could change slowly, therefore, if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch for you. this would be good pictures to begin with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of ranges from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin and the lower adjust the contrast (glare).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can still be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; filter engraving your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped on wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure, where color does not use the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monal landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering process. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: splits the image in cells, and lets it look as if it looks through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analog to the waved blocks 1 is distorted here with another version of glittering blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using a sharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Disharper: wipe the image along the circular lines that originate from a central point. this simulates the impose a zoomal camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial nonsharpness: wipe the picture by turning the pixels around a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: the picture shows the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion of motion: ignorant the picture by horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft subsharpness: ignorant the picture soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamer and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shooter: wipe the image by random shift of the pixels and simulates the deficiaries of an arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Dissharpness: finds the Farms in the image and wipe them out without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and then created by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time to calculate and cause high CPU load. you can thus break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice small tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your images a great look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of the drips. since the drop size doesn't grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number is changing the number and the density of drops. fishway changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digious; image processing a range free of shelves. do not use the option to select the range, e.g. a face that will remain free. if you then start the filter regulator, the area will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it mirroring or rotating into the right orientation. the tools can be mirroring in the marriages or transforms.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you find a picture bubbles and how you can find the missing information? how can you find the missing information here or guess? the Cimg algorithm is used here, making here a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformers size change in menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change requires a linear interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digious; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS label in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Adjust the aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the aspect ratio will be retained at the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is related to larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it becomes more difficult, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons stores as and loading will be used exactly. each entry for the photo can be stored as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and take a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below a sample for photo bubbles by using a small paint image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a frequent operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. in order to cut a photo simply the rectangle with the mouse, through the mouse button and drag the rectangle, create. you will then see this rectangle over while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you get rid of the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut out. by doing so, you can change a good overview as your photo after cutting. you can move the size of the cut area by drag the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle gives you up simply with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting machine, use the button The First-button in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save in the file to save the new clipped photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the screening area you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In case of aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the greater value of the height is assigned and in the cross-format width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio sets a relative aspect ratio. this means it is always equal, regardless of whether you are centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of dialogue there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in dialogue, you can set the Max. proportion to the range of cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio sets the settings depending on the aspect-orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you describe the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will be mirrored and not the original pattern.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the collations help enable help to put up your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-rule, harmonious triangles is a possibility to share a rectangle with similar triangles to the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division made on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the flowering leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things we can feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already by the old Egyptians and Greeks who used your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden graduation in all times when you put up your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is taken from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number is equal to 1 equal to 1: 1.618 the golden centre. a composition that is defined as a visual harmonic.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid assets available when you set up an image. these assist are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer results for your photos. compared to third-level, the golden spiral produces a liquid line of the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to lenose the golden spiral. this may be a line of line or different objects. this can easily be because of its eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangle also refers to the top of the golden spiral. its vertex points are the center points of the sides of golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles make no equinous triangles. a diagonal to these lines can be filmed more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you want to break gold triangles in order to break your frame, you create an effect of professional Photograph dynamic Symmetry. try your focus on one of the chives and other visual information about triangles. the result is a very attractive, which you can not reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious particle.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color, you can set the color of the help lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this type you can adapt the colour of lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera upset vertically and horizontal. this creates a picture in which the things can be rotated with the & digious; image processing and tool free rotation. select transformers Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button settings you can reset the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After reading a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to fix it is to use the function of transformation from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">A more elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option lets the image a bit after rotation. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspecular transformations are performed for a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you must use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right-hand side of the dialog, you will find some information which will help you change perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to right: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees to the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes somewhat slower. for individual adjustment is this effect small, but two adaptations create a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After receiving the perspective, you get irreplacable triangular holes at the corners. one way to transfer this, it is the picture with transformers trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in a direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no turning, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is distorted into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer.</seg>
<seg id="679">Set your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you press on default, the angle is set to zero. a preview of Effective will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed on the right of the show area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After completing the coating, the picture becomes a bit weird. this effect is mostly negligible, but two bills are twice as much more blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shot, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the image with transformers trimming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images from your system and, in some cases, by the way such libraries are computed. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digious; edit.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to localize pictures geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-seeing dialog appears then. in order to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains naturally data the same time recorded at the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation was performed by the coordinates in red. GPS traces data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the time zone will be carried out with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The deviation for the maximum time variance gives an upper deviation for GPS time and camera duration. if the deviation is lower, the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have any trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds then correlate every pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS is located, you can set these boundaries here and then press the button correlated to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have set a set of photos on the same location. since the dialogue itself the coordinates of a call to the next, you will only need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo.</seg>

<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums and HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages compliant to version 4.01. you can select the albums that can be exported to HTML pages. the character set will encoded UTF-8 to enable a best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four horsemen in which the settings can be adjusted to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the albums are not set up hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area, the Albenzoschau and the text of the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider also defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is created largely self-explained. if you then click on a picture a new page is displayed in the image below. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider record defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated pictures. select a folder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information is stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the standard color depth. naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are explained by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="828">The horsemen set allows you some of the settings from the album rider for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user on how far the action is. press abrupt to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module creates the pages the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program reports to see if mistakes appear during production. the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery. press closing around the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basis operations like rotation, zooming or sept. the viewer can use short commands and buttons. it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>

<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without blocking your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to store images in JPEG format, without the usual loss of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is it the file size increases since no compression of colour information takes place. this is also found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera clients is a tool that you can connect to your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera clients has not yet any documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of KIPI teams under KDE-Imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor is currently no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list KDE-Imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI teams.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the importing function of metadata module, you can copy the data from one image to another. select the image dialog box with which you want to copy the target program, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied to OK after clicking on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please look at exiv2 to view which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiator module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video like a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiator module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically generated on the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can create a background color for the slide. with this module, it is possible to create formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. you can finally use the K3b program to burn the media.</seg>
<seg id="845">First of all, you need to select the images that will be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. afterwards, you can launch the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected from you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting photos or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be chosen from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds which is shown below. the speed of the picture process is set to below. a lower value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background colour can be set as next. in doubt, you should make it black. you can set the name and the path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you add an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this is integrated into the film. after you have adapted all settings of your requirements, you can quickly drink a coffee at the speed of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer you can drink a coffee and drink the slide, if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adapt the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the right side down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistent allows multiple images to print on a sheet of paper in standard photo-sizes. this can also be done automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sensible, to improve you or print with the Gimp module to direct print.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import your images stored in RAW format stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that there are the same results as the software from your camera equipment. sometimes you'll get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted, and start the module. the Raw image converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button Preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values re-adjusted to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings can be adjusted for the white balance. the main parameters such as Gamma, Brightness and Red / Blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A 4-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contradiction information. if your camera works in RGB Mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and the conversion result is equal, and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lower-loss algorithm, and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">As well as image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your picture and use the lossless LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to edit your pictures often or otherwise you should not use the JPEG format, as it only makes a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG format, the metadata is included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start with the trigger button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking device mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. through testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual pictures. however, here you have the opportunity to write an existing file automatically. this is helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt. however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all pictures in an album. it uses the program to convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the image size from the ImageMagick package. you can change the image size (size) or enlarge. in addition, four types of image change are available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the picture is automatically chosen, depending on the orientation orientation, chosen. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your picture to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio will be changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressurized: prepares the image for photo pressures. the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo apsioner. the target picture, including background size, boundary size and background colour, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of additional images before. more pictures can draw on the list of visual images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having started the module, the pictures window with which you anticipate your pre-chosen images can be added. you can add some pictures above the button. for the last one-chosen image, you'll see a preview on the right page.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also extract images on the picture list and add the images to the list of visual images.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button images will be removed from the list of images that are removed from the list.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the New message -window of your e-mail clients. you'll need to add only the addresses and the subject. selected images are already attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many images on once. most E-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send multiple mails, if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and stored once again until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path to your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you need to install the Gmail agent on your computer before. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">Following the selection of comments in an attached file, comments are added to the images in a text file and attached the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the loss-free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files in the JPEG format, then the original extrudates will be added to the visual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is ready, the window will not automatically shut down, you can view the status message, looking for errors, but your e-mail program will be automatically opened at the end. with the button switching, you can shlie this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, you will see a window with questions such as you want to see your slide. you can choose between you selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation use very elegant image processes using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card since otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filename ensures that the filename of the pictures is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually break with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images accidentally choose that the pictures is shown in a random order, so the pictures of the pictures are used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Delay between the pictures can be set the temporal distance between each pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds, and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so, you should show this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly, you choose another effect between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the diaschau you can access a toolbar on the upper left screen. move the mouse into this corner around you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower screen, you can see the current filename, the position of the current picture and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI Module time & date adjustment hasn't currently made any documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of KIPI teams under KDE-Imaging @ kde.or. warning: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI Module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE workspace.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can talk to & on photoalbum; see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, now in each group, so in people, places and in group records are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the Browser window, you can see the categories that you have received information on your favorite pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current show images. in the following every one is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the pictures are displayed on which both people are visible. by this selection method, you can limit the number of photos displayed by a few thousand pictures to some individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view images with show images to view the images of your activity area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol before their name. you can store up with & on a photoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined. see this picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button that you want to choose right outside on the toolbar. in the video context menu you can choose which you can view the view for each category separately. it has the advantage that you can view symbols with pictures of people and simultaneously a list of sample words (if you don't have any suitable pictures).</seg>
<seg id="905">But you need to set up what image is to be displayed for each individual person. now, you'll need to display the image ansification window (in closer). now you can select the image for the corresponding category. in the sizing window, you can select the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are looking for searching in the main window, you will be displayed a dialog, which is very similar to the dialog for the purpose of the image. this dialog can see you on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the field labelling or description, you can also enter a date and descriptions of the pictures according to this text. if you want, you can also enter a date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, on the pictures, on which Jesper, however, not Anne Helene is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user guide book for & delicious albums;. if you don't like to read Handbooks, but rather like to try functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & Photo Album; and watch the fast-up, screen photos and entry videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & get on the first dialogue, and select the demo album; for the first time, or select the menu option for the first time, or select a few example pictures and you can try the features of & photoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you'll find it on the homepage of & Photo Album; as an interconnected HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main character of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this lath see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each vest is then a different unit. you can change between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used on the following ways: you can select the displayed entries look ahead from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is shown in preview) and in addition, the timeline is always displayed on the current date of the currently displayed pictures, if you navigate in the preview section.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of the timeline by pressing the mouse button, and the mouse via the ruler of the timeline, so the time data. if you select a range, you will only display pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kissing album; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is integrated into & photoalbum; integrated and the other than module available (see). in the following section of the user name, the integrated version is written, which you can create files via the HTML-file... button.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you have to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each area will be more precise.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the superscript and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photoalbum; HTML sample pages, you can see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & master album will be created; the export file is to be seen on the oversight page. more information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML page. thus, you can avoid that information displayed on the HTML page. for example, see that all pictures of a party are obvious. at present all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use these settings to hide certain pictures from certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most importation options are unique, which is why not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures. this allows those who have the view and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more pictures download, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewing of your site allows you to change the resolution at any time you have set. so, it can take your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if he'd like to see a picture larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folders and the URL, where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best choose all your HTML files a base folder, and for each subsequent set a new forefolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder, in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and next time you can choose the location. here you can choose either a folder or by KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check this really all for viewing. if you have created a URL, a web browser being created, the URL, which you specify here, should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files are not yet in the final target folder you need to manually copy them. thus, the import function, see, right, you need to specify the final destination of the files, but the base folder in which all sub-folders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described subordination options are related to all three basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you set the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">In case you are looking forward to a family party, meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kisson album; you can, of course, have a HTML page to look at the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & have a photoalbum; this work doesn't even make.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & delicious album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the pictures can be stored in the file or whether the pictures can be stored in the file, that you have all images together and to give this file so independent. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file directly from the menu Export... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, the pictures are not found in the folder of .kim file. if the images are not found, the pictures of the URL you are searching for creating the HTML files. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following example, the dialog for Export images are described, which you can export via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended for internal or external .kim files. these three selection options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual setting up to .kim file, you must copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied to the .kim file. copy & photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most images have been compressed with JPEG image and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to, just select the export file format.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limit the maximum image size. if you don't send your friends pictures, you would like to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would be very big. here you can say that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & cracked album; the exportalized database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to imports consists of four steps. first, you must select which pictures you would like to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are using the category of personalised file personer (if you are a Dane), while this category is asked to be imported in the third dialog box, which are to be imported into the third dialog box, which are to be imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can see the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is visible on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and look at: if you are looking at pictures, you want to view pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your boyfriend to discover, you may want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) fixed the information about your pictures, through (2) searching and see to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it has been extended and today also takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual may be talked about pictures, but frequently closes these videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Winter album; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup power tools, copying on a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& delicious album; remember the folder, in which your images are stored and use this in future starts automatically. if you wish to read another folder with pictures, you can start a different folder with pictures, so you can start a file -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry settings on photoalbum; set up... get to a window that allows you to change the settings of & photoalbum; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to you.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, which allows you to view a preview of and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call through a button on the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in you how you can designate different properties for each image, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">In view of the dialog, used to edit already existing groups. for each available group you can choose a labelling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialogue options, you can set up complete member groups, for example, all members of a group set up in a group instead of all groups of a panglider.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view, you can see the setup options available to you with the selection list. you can choose to configure the category. in the left window, you can see a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Winter album; its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiplug and gameview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & KDE; image Plugin Interface. nourishing information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & their photoalbum, but are not distributed separately. most modules, however, have a help-page that you can call about the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with the demo database before using the demo database before using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. don't say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI, are very different, making it possible to work some modules with & master album; this is the downside when you share features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & the photoalbum; and other applications that can also use KIPI, is that the album is simply a folder. even if & delicious album; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here simulates & kissing album; the current album, which corresponds to the current view, all pictures depicting you at the moment at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & photoalbum has to be handed over; the modules also handed over a list of albums. here & on a photoalbum, proceed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & have a photoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used the category that you have set up in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you are using the category of individuals, & do so, so if you selected persons to view and do this with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbums are not compatible, you can remove these from the list of modules. launch the setup dialog, and select modules that are loaded modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen, once you start & have a photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see at the top of a menu and one tool bar. at the moment, you can't see any information about your pictures. in this section, we will show no information about your pictures. in this section, we will see a glance at the pictures show that shows you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to view any image with notes. this includes information about the people who have recorded on the picture, etc. you can set every image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time. if shown on all pictures Jesper is illustrated and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in section. if you want, you can see these notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box, by clicking people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photoalbum, as you can always use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the moving images within the list: if you have a family celebration, and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5-10 people, you can, therefore, that the used names are moved up, the people can find faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an illiterated list, click on the icon for sorting according to the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes on each image individually, you might still need to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes. Click this case simply to the front and back buttons that are located under the picture of the picture right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have added multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all of these images and use the menu option more than once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to indicate that it is a transition, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment Yes, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also put an entry into a category and place there, in order to sort this entry into an subcategory of this entry. attention, this sets out that you are currently alphabetically sort your categories.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the Comment, by forming the bodies, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and postpone. you can also make a private window by drag him out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, click on the button choices, click on the button choices..., which provides you among other things the opportunity to save the current structure and the look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely squeeze out a frame. if you want to see this window later again, use the button... and here window an / out-out. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the entry pictures in your browser, you will get an overview of the current selected images, or all pictures if you do not have filters. you can see the size of the images, by simply down pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply times.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you make a picture on your desktop background, this image will be set up as background picture for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't open a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures from which you want to delete pictures from which you want to delete, and press either the removing button or select at the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& delicious album; provides you for this issue a solution to you. you can also use photos stored on the hard disk. of course, you can also have the pictures anywhere, so you can record the pictures anywhere in the database. in the picture you can see the view of & the photoalbum; if not all the required images of the hard drive can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right corner cut off right corner is not stored on the hard disk. this is, for example, see images 1-9, but for pictures 5-9, however, the show images are present, so that & the photoalbum you can view this pictures. however, you can't look at this pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function does not need to copy files from the folders and to copy it again. so, if you don't want to avoid having to avoid the one in question your pictures, please do not buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to remain a little more privacy, you can view the pictures that you want to do for others, and click on the pictures that you may see your little sister, taxes and menu entry. everything else you can unlock.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set which pictures in the case of the font are supposed to be hidden. if you lock the laptop to your little sister, simply dial the menu entry pictures, which you will be locked out. if you want to see the pictures once again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into unlock the pictures. to set up this password, select password change the menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this image protection is not very safe. for example, you can read or delete all pictures of the file index.xml. this type of password protection is used only to those who are not familiar with & photoalbum; not very familiar to reverb the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & delicious albums; manage and spend hours over hours so that you want to look at some point. this is why you have a photo _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you've got on the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the top part of the picture you want to see, so you can also configure them with the mouse, and you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">A few words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you would have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several pictures in the viewer, you can set between them and return by using the buttons below high and image below. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run this as diaschau. then you can reload a new picture after a few seconds. as often, a new picture can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus respectively Minus. started and stopped the slide through the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer's contemplative tool; it is possible to change in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. just use the input button to change in full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer you can easily get out and zoom out into the image. with the Minus button you can get out in the middle of the picture. showing how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equator, the zooms set the screen so that each pixel's pixel screen is equivalent to a pixel's screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations operate with videos that are in and out zooming with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turnout functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this doesn't work with videos. you can make comments on the current picture with the menu option comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can view pictures, you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view the check and configuration dialog box to enter these names. but you might prefer to draw the image only and look for more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and see them as well or bad, while you are looking for one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with traits, while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by doing so that you can press the corresponding letters. in case you see a picture in which features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you can see them in your browser. so you can see all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you've selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be shown in the preview of view. if you can view categories in Dre Preview preview, you can simply add features to the images by pressing the letter for the feature, after the image was chosen. you can see here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you will allow you to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The gemmess is not saved with the image, but in the database. on the way you can reverse your old-old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In case you can see a painting on the painted picture. in order to place the painting of & kphotoalbum; click on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting just click on the cross in the toolbar above on the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & cpovmodelers; you have to control the use of the program & Povray; not completely control, but documentation to & Povray; you should absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire modal view yellow are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an selected object, as all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object, click on the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple positions, the following open-down menu will be built, so you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With extinction either from the menu bar, edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on users to adopt these changes. if you have not checked the invalid values, you can report a message with a error message, then you can reset the input commands and reset the changes to abort.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL-user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you are editing a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview of your own-wide view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the self-economic view and a small example of the scene is looted with the selected texture. if you want to render a sublime item (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross it locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Screen photo shows the camera control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and turning as well as the position of shifting. you can change the shift in line with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has an visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relatively to visibility or higher level. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visible point of visible level of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window layout as default. the object-tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window layout, or if you need a different arrangement, you can also adjust it as well. you can also store multiple shutters and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To fix a window via or underneath a view, head to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle is then showing the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, go to the right or left side of a view. the new view will be anchored on the right or left side of this view, extending over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to classify several views in the middle of another view, you can then switch between the views by clicking on the maps world heading up in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window settings are clicked views: views which are not embedded in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring point, head to your desktop, or click on the small pointing left uphill path in the summary bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the summary bar. to prevent the lock, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be correctly installed. as this manual is written, it was & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the symbol rendering the symbol rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render-mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rench a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert many Render modes, from a quick preview up to full images in utmost quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you click on the symbol The Render, click on the toolbar or in the menu view Render Modi..., the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered picture. if you want to rendering only one small area of the image, select the check box bottom section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination quality, you can select the properties that use & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. an exhaustive description of the Render properties will be found in the user guide book & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image with only one ray varies depending on pixel, various errors can be created. these pictures often have a moirè pattern or step effects in bends and lines, and sometimes details do not appear if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique used anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general, pictures with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn off anti-aliasing, calculates and combines & Povray; more than one ray depending on pixel. this technique means super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. adaptive because the super-sampling is adaptive; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is further dissolved and adaptive because each pixel is dependent on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray will pursue a beam ever pixel. if the difference between the values at the neighboring pixel, then both pixels are processed by a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values of red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference is divided between the values given the default threshold, then the pixel's pixel can be examined individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates the diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust if the alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams does not have an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; -console edition. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; import, select the menu entry file importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>

<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler, import this source context between the two special comments / / * PMRawat and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object-tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds to the source code text in the Editor. to import objects into the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it to the object-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpovmodelers; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also add.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpoveder; a scene is rendered; usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>

<seg id="1062">The colour for the wireless models. the second color is used for the display of selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The colour for control points. the second color is used for display the selected inspection points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle stands for the visibility in the camera-view and in the window-type mark.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object-catch of points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can adjust the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a precise wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detail amplifier for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high details fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further broken when the camera uses a extended projection. this feature gives a better rapprochement for the projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is drawn behind the objects. the wall is shown in a checkerboard pattern in two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you indicate ground, a soil underneath the objects is rendered. the floor is shown in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate the wiring, the non-recursive antialiasing method for rendering the scenes is set. values for depth and swelling could adjust you. precise data to the parameters you can see in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing shutters or create new window orders. in the window section, it is explained how to create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination box standard window layout: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovModer; used the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window arrangements displays all existing window instructions. a new arrangement can add a button on the button and remove a select arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window layout. new views may add to the button adding and erase selected views using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you can create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with flaws, you can get a card postcard together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just installed & Povray; and & kpovModer; installed and now you would like to follow any more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this manual, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings, before you complain that as a result, you can only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D programme for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules for rendering is applied, as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you'll get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless installed, see the first Start of & kpovModer; the following pre-installed window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation, so that you can expect an adequate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object-tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry editing. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The open-screen view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model (right below). this is the view of the scene from the camera's point of view. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object properties, where the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation on & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything on the fundamental settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera can change the camera in view of the camera, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on the left mouse button on a control point and drag him to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button users or the input devices, the wire model views and the object-tree change immediately to these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the view of the camera here.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you might include a Quader (Insert Endless Body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an easy method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovModer; in fact, it offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object-tree, change the name and then press the button users or the surgery. in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The open-circuit diagram now shows the plane, though at the moment only as limited endable level. if you rendering the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you view the object-tree, you'll notice that you can see the entry for the bottom. in this case, you will see the various parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for any new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change also the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should shift the ground to the exercise a unit under the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shifting and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to insert its material characteristics. there are many different materials, but select something single in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue that you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the object of the object. you can change the name in the object-tree view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview can you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a strong black material because you can add settings for the pigment. therefore, remember to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the pigment. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the easiest way now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't look any color on Quader and ball, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, you are not the Farbenz. here you have to set two new attributes. in the list list, you have to select two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the box colour list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object-tree, select and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be easily done as you can already handle the basic functions of & kpovModer; the ball rotates just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the Settings or button use), so the ball would floating on the ground because you moved the ground around a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Naturally, the Rendering is now a strange result: as before, the ball-surface looks like a matte black material. put the next step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already on the floor, type the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the principle and change the name for example in ball pigment. Click on the pigment, select input and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interesting effects if you take time to insert some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection result already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: still not chosen:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should have a good impression of that which features you & kpovmodelers; hopefully, you have learned something so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayewing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracts a scene from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renews the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the Render is calculated, like this beam will be reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects like a fog can effect. so the scene is processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see any camera without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source, see also nothing, the image is simple black. obviously, every scene needs to be looted, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In common file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have created with & kpovmodelers;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. is it a new file, you have to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Shows the scene again stored in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage will be rejected.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the tool bar. you can add and remove the toolchain for & kpovmodelers; add commands and remove orders.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is an option to remove rough surfaces, without any hives to be modeled separately on the surface and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes, which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these principles. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, using an image file as a colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient picture viewing and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Pictures can be displayed in either a window in the size of the image or full screen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1462">When you record this entry, you can select the published dialog files to add to the project. this is the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog for the project. the only difference is the extra button burning, the & k3b. burning of burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make a lot of project related settings. any project type has different potential settings, most of them are described above what is this? -help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this is useful if you're using files for a multi-review CD. this is useful if you are using files for a multi-session CD. it is intended for you, even if this function is not used, so that you can see the files existing in the medium already existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only in an active data-CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature makes & k3b, imported files from the current project. this function removes no files from the medium, it only blends the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD copy dialog. this also allows copying a CD to any other medium. alternatively, you can also only create a copy of a CD instead of the normal copy. you should also prefer to copy cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copy dialog. this also allows copying a DVD to any other medium. alternatively, you can only do a copy of a DVD instead of normal copy. moreover, there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue is not yet supported, therefore the target medium must be big enough to record the entire (video) data of the source mediums in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Open the dialog to delete a CD-RW, so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW drive.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog to formatting a DVD. using this dialogue you can format a DVD ± R (W) whereby the content is completely deleted. & k3b, allows you to write the choice between writing modes and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously made CD image. the dialog can be burned after a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are not yet supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously invented DVD image. the dialog will prompt you after an * .iso file as a source of data, which can be burned instantly by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously sourced DVD video can be converted. this dialogue window usually appears after the reading of a DVD in the ingredients, but can also be used as listed below. it contains information about the exquisite video, code settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is presented in the content view and include properties of the media, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b;. if one entry is crossed, the tool bar is currently displayed in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is blinded.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Switches the folder view or off. the folder view is an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the content is activated, the content will appear in the content list. CD / DVD drives have also displayed a context menu with functions such as media information, blocking and unlock the drive or expeller of the media.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Switches the ingredients a or off. the content view allows selecting and pulling files into the projection screen. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The head bar in the projectile is a narrower area, which is only visible when the projectile is open to open projects. the headlamps has no real function, it looks pretty pretty and divides the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for modifying the key assignments for & k3b. after one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key to the key below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b, execution assistants. thus, the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrators need to be required. therefore, you must enter the password for the system administrators (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here you can make general programs settings. almost all functions of & k3b; you should work on Anhieb. this dialogue is designed for personalise and adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is how many other & KDE; -applications also, with one & DCOP; -interface equipped. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a switch script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; -functions to use, you can either use the command line dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical, therefore, rather your taste and the way of your task is crucial, which will give you the enclosed programs.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you are using the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; to use it, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then, enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Next to the general & DCOP; -functions, all & KDE; program common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatDVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createMedia Project () DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject () DCOPRef createDataProject (): copyref createDataProject (): copyref createModProject (), copyrightDvd (), burnCdimage (), burndimage (KURL).</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one can generate a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject Through using this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is applicable only to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">A createFolder (QString name), addureFolder (QString name, QString Quartu), addurl (KURL:: List URLs, QString Quartor, QString path), renameItem (QString path, QString newname) and setlist ID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple file, and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3b interface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT creamy Folder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT simply / home / truck.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& KaudioCreator; is an audio CD; choice for & KDE; with it can be easily read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder of the machine installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& KaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the output of & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and of many Kodiers who are using these WAV files (compression-free compression). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (loss-free compression) are still to be added (if you have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the Title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per titles) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the output of the & CD, it is used by & audioCreator; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coding are already present. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, but it is probably not necessary to compile yourself. however, if FLAC is not used, the installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What code readers / file format should be used? the Chapter World Water Kodiers provides a small introduction about coding, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying of protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, uses & audioCreator; cdparanoia is designed to read any copy protection. if not the firmware version of the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection; even not the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid simply the purchase of head-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), is explained after daily handling of a & CD. this leads to the hard disk approach of the user interface, which you will frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the FreeDB file or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog for programming notifications (like protocols, piepsen) for programming events (such as read the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different cards (such as encoder, for setting up the Encoders). here, you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding, compression rates, and helps you to choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG is the most common. OGG makes today a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrate (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate, the differences are less important since both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will nevertheless supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high quality sound quality (with high bitrate) but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a machine-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG cutting devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these tools usually support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters on the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This attitude gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This attitude should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 up to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good sound for music by adolescents, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting is exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are entered manually or by the program automatically retrieved from the FreeDB file, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudioCreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of programming settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or help to the code explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the sample rate (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch -tt &gt; lame and the title parameter of & kaudioah must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button identification in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the FreeDB is: a free database, in which people can download / enter the information, so that all others can download this information instead of itself in the computer. it is necessary to note that here only the text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of pieces & etc, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (anxfrance of the translation) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent from the & CD; there is no more or less valuable, so neither can neither the artist nor the music company damage. any information can be obtained at a Bummel by a & CD; business, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & KaudioCreator; for use of FreeDB can be attached to a check box. in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used when retrieving the data from server (This can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & check box; for use of FreeDB, the geographical closest to the next mirror server will be needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the burden between machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflections for the online retrieval of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created per month) only the updating of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which code program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; for those who want to know more precisely, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to be aware that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution first, if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the file format WAV files, the code can be selected and thus the desired file format. during the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) can be added to the address of the Kodierers. other encoders may be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution, before the code may be used. this is also necessary for the predefined Kodiers. further information on Kodiers are in the Chapter World Code.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers you can get more information about his switch through the input of a command such lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed coding.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device number of the & CD; / DVD drives, the write and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter by step example. even if you use different settings, you can give the tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but is somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all set up and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sample rate (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There have to be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as a compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not totally free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you own write permission (eg; by copying something into the cross-queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set of & kaudioCreator; something probably being done just once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the presentation of a & CD, which must be repeated for each reading & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the used code compression in compression (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the FreeDB to download and download the file from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with each reading of a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device model is given to the program code so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device number of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt to contain the existing entries of the device labels for the & CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card General Settings. here you can not do much. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is omitted / entered as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select that you will be informed when data are missing (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD automatically download the Internet from a FreeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: this calculator must be connected to the internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the FreeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selector is easier, is a & CD; entry is found immediately if you are dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filenames or tag entries, it can be easily changed. the directory and filename is changed using the directory entry and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from that example, if you want to manually type all manually in the offline mode, you can download the selection fields and FreeDB will not be used. however, if you are using FreeDB in off-line mode, you'll need to select whether you have to select FreeDB in off mode. if you want to select FreeDB in off mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following box card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us FreeDB. these are attitudes for the data enquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from the FreeDB server via the internet. how does the system which data should get the CD? read the section about FreeDB. put everything in as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we just want to work with remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the site free server and look to a mirror server in your vicinity. on this road the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">They both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls operate the protocol 8880 standardly, there may be more fortunate with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf in the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want & CD to transmit data to the FreeDB server. the first check box is to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen photo. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous tunes: apologies, there is a reason why more than one at the same time, using only a existing drive? parallel reading and encode? the author does not know, therefore, try to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, put this on around the & CD; to throw at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you cross it, then the path / folders can be stored in which the WAV files can be stored. this can't be fixed if only space on another drive is available. do not forget the files in private folder. don't forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything can be done as it is on the screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances, something must be floated to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already stated before, it is sufficient to offer a very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting rate of bitrate is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. this reached the compression factor 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be deleted as desired. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & KDE; in case of later changes of tags.% f and% are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous wav-files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic set of & audio. finished. this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of choice of the & CD. it is described in the previous section and furnished. first, a connection to the Internet is built, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the FreeDB can be arranged. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in FreeDB, see the screen photos a bit different from that for a & CD; with successfully completed FreeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually instead of retrieve them from the Internet. comments are pointing to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD now must be entered into the drive which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be found in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, search in section Questions and Answers after the assistance, or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Caution: if the & CD won't be picked up from the FreeDB, all tracks are already filled out and in addition, the artist's name and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for automatic query from FreeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually fix it by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, you can pick up the data from the internet, you will need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor, entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Type the data for your & CD; accordingly to the pattern on the next screen photo. title of the piece in the first line of the 'Updated title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'Update', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments. the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from the FreeDB is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen photo. however, it is always a good idea to review the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (for example, if all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to prove if there is any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Please note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you have ID3v2 tags, this option will be set up at the Kodierero Settings menu; take a look inside the 'Basic Settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later, with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodiers or file formats. see Help to Kodierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply dial one entry, which is obviously not important with the style of the perimeter CD; this example is not important since we do not transmit the & CD; for more information, please visit the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the selected data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece definitely will be any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way up to all the cover data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear if you have downloaded the data from the FreeDB. it is already sorted into one of these categories.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and album are displayed on the play list.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons who compile from source files, and not for users who use a compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for assistance, as the program can be adjusted to suit your needs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs, has many variations on settings. best read the step for step example to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of the different flashcards of the settings and also contains comments on options which are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1613">How about this? who reads this, has probably already started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author can't record this manual. it is meant as the first version for a manual and change. if you always want to add something useful or change, it may do. at least first after contact with the author. and if you read this section, it is misunderstood this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when you managed to get the source file from the & KDE; SVN, then you don't need this information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& Kmid; is the Midi- and Karaokespieler of & KDE; besides others, he has also some features that do not have some features, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& mid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS System, so on all systems with OSS - and & KDE; support the & Linux; an Ultrasound project driver supported for GUS cards. ALSA is included once it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& mid; displays the song text on the screen with changing colour, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel when using the pressing buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so you're in & KDE; every MIDI file from a & tapqueror; -window can put on KMid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (file events or textile events). Kmid is automatically calculated using the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you complete & KDE; during the departure of a song, Kmid will start again with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu, select the usual File dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also convert a file from a & tapqueror; window in the & cmid; windows drop. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and play the button shooting in the tool bar, select the entry to play from the menu piece or check out the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & cmid; a piece automatically starts when you move it to the & cmid; -window. (with several pieces, they will be added to a collection and then played one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece is playable, you can jump in any place by using the medium mouse button and drive with the knob and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click on the arrows left and right the speed display. to get the original tempo again, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the bar is acting as a pressure on the button, or the select menu entry in menu piece, thus interrupts playing. do the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text inclines, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & mid; you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically selected to enable a song manually, so you will automatically select the karaoke text. but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to adjust a type of event, select from the menu settings and the entries of the text messages or windows. the same function also have keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these will be played in the series, in this section as you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To set up a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the point organising.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the choosen in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When adding the application, this collection will not be stored. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you must add to the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button adding. it appears in turn to the file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatically to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If Automatically is activated for the collection, a piece is automatically added to the opening (using File Transfer or drag & drop) to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs can be played. if you select the row after the sub-menu of the menu collections, songs in the order will be played as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button "previous piece, the previous piece from the menu or press the button on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can't be extinguished. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & cmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizers that are not General-MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map general-MIDI events in events that understands the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright piano in the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus plays a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only a sound card, you don't need MIDI-map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file (with your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which stores all the necessary changes for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may seem as often as desired. premise for this is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the keymap"... End Define KEYMAP "A further keymap... End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can provide in future versions of & kmid; can provide support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all sounds that need this instrument on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not sufficient for example (e.g. with clay 60), you can see a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun. do not wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if so now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (vying), patch is 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound in the MIDI file stands.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which each note is a different percussionist instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one that means tone the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds can be displayed on a certain channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines are very important, so their presence. you must therefore create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keyholes for each channel and any instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds on the perimeter channel. look for example the provided Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, you simply make it simply at the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built following the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is here the channel that is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the corresponding key map needs to be defined on the front in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored if you try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example, to always use the permeable patch on the perkype channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitch Bender ratio can be multiplied by the ratio of Pitch-Bender events. if therefore, a MIDI file is converted to the value of n, this will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file does not decimal (decimal come).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch, a sound higher with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards can play up to one octave above. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & cmid; try a try.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu, Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole series of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these pires you see which sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the canalview to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can use an instrument, the button is no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to indicate the played sounds. view from the menu settings under the point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed at which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow down to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music is needed. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">OK, I can never force to use & cmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs about 50 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer get a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; they have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">That can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & cmid; it happens because & cmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to solve the problem you must download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a complete folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that supports & drop; drag & drop. open just the folder you want to add in & Conqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">To add previously the setup automation add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can select the arrow key to the left from Tempo- LCD to slow the play. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I've been on a & KDE; -Play a & Conqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this screen, I need to play a MIDI file or if I want to play a file, just into the & Conqueror; windows change and the desired file into the window of & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, turn the setting Automatically to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening of Files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.I.d. first you want to play the first file. so, set the setting Automatically at the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains then exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you disconnect, also B.mid and C.mid, and create a collection with all three files. how do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard shows me feel it on & mid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& Kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacute; but I'm trying to take a bit of time for my Hobbies, but I'm trying to collect a bit of time. as Hobbies I wanted to collect MIDI files, make music and prove things.</seg>

<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy. if you balance a record, his group and all his subgroups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>

<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you must be selected from the menu to playlist and select either the Edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during boot and end can be disabled by editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayf and modify (General Options] No intro = 0 obtaining option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the tool bar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition to the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayfully. here is an example of a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special field Embed for YouTube in playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To use the & kmplayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & kmplayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-Shockwave-flash needs to be specified in the setup dialog type KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is used in a consoles application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if no error occur here, the backend issue is within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So always a given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayfully. for example, phoneon must play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards either by using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs a kxvplayer) before TV can be configured to use the device and TV channels. for this purpose, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video Data Recorder) settings in the kmplayer is the dialog box below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XVideo port to use. there should be ports to be found. the correct code must be found (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably included a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo (probably this kind of playing of video devices amongst Linux is the only that works). this is also only available on the first screen (: 0.0). this is why the videoforlinux needs to be functioning for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must therefore be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1749">To learn more about & Kate; and his possibilities should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can begin with the editor's title with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; the right language: Lay-TECH is the right language: Lay-TECH. that is difficult to use, can also use a Laie (english.Lay) & latex; -macro. a less demanding but realistic interpretation is that it originates from Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In this case, only a good news look at & latex; it is not the ultimate book for it. for example, there is not the ultimate book. for example H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 daemon.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other pronunciation languages includes & latex; an introduction that will be defined with the general properties such as paper format, page numbering and text library with the text. the introduction must be closed with the command\\ issue {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Fast-entry assistant of & kile; is a major function for the quick creation of a document in & cile;. selecting the wizard (MenÃ ¼) offers some opportunities for creating the document. it can also be done some of the document related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document categories: this is hereby referred to the type of document document: articles (article), Book [book], Report [Report], Report (DIN) [scrungs], Report (DIN) [scrable], projector [Prosper], Foil [Prosper] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is set to set the character codes. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most widely used additional packages for & latex; for the integration they are only in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Review (DIN): the document categories of Coma-Script (to comply with German DIN standards). you should always find German text.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users are now not worried anymore. these are merely a brief description of the functions and further information in this section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& cile; provides - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unmatching). you should remember any mathematical environment that any mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it is possible through the highlighting time and Ã ¼ rator.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic adjustment of environments for entering a new command (for example\\ '{order}) of & cile; automatically creates a space (for entering the text) and the add-on line to be closed (e.g.\\ end {orders}). this function can be disabled in the menu settings; set up the LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into a few elements. & latex; provides the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most beautiful and subtracing element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When changing the document, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective piece.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; -files can be found very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file [rounded File)] has been created, jumps & cile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the format document and also other information such as font size and is also available in addition to PDF the available output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the rÃ ¼ rink search, the elements of the DVI; file is coupled with the editor and as soon as an element in DVI; -file has been clicked on the opposite section. once on a section in & latex; -source code is clicked, the relevant passage in DVI; -viewer is speckled.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this feature is used for work with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified using other embedded .tex files. in the use of a project can be set up to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick assembly: the & latex; -source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (provided no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode the DVI; file can be downloaded on paper. it takes no call of & eyepiece; it takes place after the rapid assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the processing tool bar, the three large selection criteria should be observed. the first selection box has been developed for the fast gain of document in parts, chapters, sections,... The negotiable & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box for further information is available for items such as Tags, fusions, notes or references. the available articles are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for one section, one image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a fixed name (selection of a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a list of selection is displayed with literary additions. for the editing of & BibTex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & BibTex; -files can also be written in & cile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ merit will be used for the establishment of the font. it can be specified for the main text, mersior notes, etc., the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & cile, two choices of selection are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document from selecting the document type and legend section. 2. the document can be written by reason.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ 'box contains the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font. if the font is not established, it can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; -source code must be compiled. the easiest way to this is to use the menu button or the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & cile; for storing automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If you missed the document, you should be searched for errors in the log. if you use fast-construction activity & eyepiece. if this is not the case, it should also be considered the logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text which is treated differently than the rest of the document. for example, a report with the text may have a different font. the command\\ may {wonder},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} may be enlightened.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be seen within the area (from\\ instances} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restrictions (number) for the changes within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many opportunities to be heard of the legibility and usability of the document. it can be changed, for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ {{emph}: this command is available for the cursive pressure and is open until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be rendered extensively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quantum: created a quote from the document. the quote begins with\\ '{ote} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In view of the background to the writing of the source code with the & latex; presentation language, now a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & cile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the wizard has been entered a bit of text, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be carried out. this should be a quote, a few positions in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem to application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor to the editor. in an external viewer, the window should be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript language; / PDF file. easy to try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a rounded file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers from the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi edition like printers, & PostScript; / PDF Converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps are available as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed out using the file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar requires the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file is created from the & latex; -source code was created, the conversion can begin using existing PFE in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-trial search illuminate the direct jump from the editor to the desired position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& hile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; -binding files. only modern must be able to set up with Settings... tools ballot.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the formidable search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in one line of the source code and will be clicked on a front-search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; viewer is then carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1795">This function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the appropriate & latex; -document of & kile; dimensions and to the corresponding line specs. to do & check; in & ocular; as text editor is specified (Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick construction of the & DVI; viewer can't find an error, it may be an error in the log file, or in the news window, or in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file extension refers to the source code in the source code. in the editor then the buttons can be used in error messages. the log file is always displayed on the error in which the error appears to be clicked on the error in the logging, navigating immediately to the error.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once upon the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window is available to select the presentation of the presentation for the document. the default values are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can be used either by reason for a new document or the assistant to the rapid creation of a new document. more information on this section are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates are made in & cile; prepared, stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you must either create an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be created or a new file. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document, and create a presentation of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables may set up in settings... settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entry in document design. typically, they will be used as follows:\\ 'Class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard, and that for the verbs of the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps has been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, then your own template instead of the standard size can be grown.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A presentation may be created from each & latex; -files are created. a simple way to create a template should be searched after one on the Internet and be drilled under steps under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers based on many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & BibTex;). lots of settings for & Kate; can be done directly in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his mom should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; click there directly with the reading of the title & Kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& cile; provides a very practical & latex; command referential which may be called for the menu help LaTeX reference. you can contains a description of virtually all commands, which can be found in & latex; use can use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with a press Ctrl key to exploit the & tex. this means that in this way clicking on\\ par from\\ par\\ bigskip is only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with groan linker moustaste, the selected text is automatically switched into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons, you can taste pieces of the source code in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& hurry; has the ability to browse the various types of source textures and emphasise this. for example, the & latex; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another colour.</seg>
<seg id="1815">A lot of assistants can be affected. this is an independent type of bookmarks within the text. the menu indicator can be emphasized within the text, or the corresponding key stamp is emphasized, so that they will automatically be emphasized in the first input of a character automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main problems when using a program like & cile;. although & Kate, offers great opportunities for writing a & latex; important functions for writing a & latex; important commands for their selection. under edit outputs, the following commands are contained to the text code:</seg>
<seg id="1817">A complete paragraph (group of lines containing on both sides have an empty line). this extended meaning does not include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive thing in & cile; is that the image is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word below the current cursor position. this selection has also an extended meaning as this command also has & latex; -commands with a yield (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For a part of a part of the document cannot be removed up and by pressing the button. & Kate; provides the key line Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with own instructions here for faster speeds. under edit removal, the following commands are included to the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & cile; is included in the description of edit equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It was already obvious that environments play a central role in & latex; for this reason, provides & cile; for further orders under Edit environment for a pleasant easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly before the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ '{environment} is, will be sprayed at the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many snowed environmental commands, quickly the sun view can be lost quickly. this command closes the last environment, so that the harsh ambient conditions is not demolished.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& cile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...} are determined. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that meet from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the reconditioned clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly behind the closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded clamp of a & tex; -group # is, the other end of the group is speckled (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many snowed groups-brackets can quickly be lost quickly. this command puts the last part, so that the lastly structure of the & tex; groups can not be broken.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple operation symbols will be used as a corporation. for the purpose of the purpose is used in & cile; the sign "for two simple beginnings is used. also for the end of the beginnings, the sign" is used. & cile; knows this case and makes for two complete beginnings for dosing & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry for double digits can be set up under Settings... LaTeX and can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in specific settings (e.g. wet or French) and therefore German or French beginnings. there are also many other languages available.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code completion was added, these in & cile; in order to extend special commands (mostly for & latex;). of these, three according as needed and the other two are suitable for automatic veritable. all these modes are used for different modes of settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment through the command\\ '{surroundings} is & cile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the click button, the last letter of input will be removed and you will see the complete list. on the other hand, the list may also shrink the list by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. the descriptions will become easier for selection of a command. alternatively, you can't allow to restrict to these positions via the Edit brand, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible with the Edit brand, and the resulting parameters can be changed.</seg>

<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner support grouping. someone who does not know my tool bar could believe that the & Conqueror, knob the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by proving all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after neweXML does not exist, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their tool bar is being loaded (s) when a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps to add the noted extension of & quantaplus; for normal users the possibility to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository, if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. then, you need to let the docrc file. we will need to handle the second part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc you = whad, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for this document, e.g. php42 / # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.2, # Sec2.3 Sections 1 = RI1.html-1 = RI1.html-2 = tag2.html-day = tag.html-day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of documentation in documentation. for example, see in the & PHP documentation; documentation here something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc thee = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = tx.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Reaction .html... Language Reference = Basic syntax = Modage.basic-synd.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it shows that it is about sub-folders in the tree with its own content. there is no known frontier for chess training depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the contents can be referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but make sure to & & lt; characters. this should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resourcendatfiles will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content of the ingredient is the area of the docrc file, which is to be displayed as a writing of a & PHP; script file for the mysql _ fetch _ array function can be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (Context List) and the file connections.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated context-based elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and go to $HOME / .kde / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc / apps / quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as specified as docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have been working with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantitilus, you are not alone. it is possible to divide the hernified resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD Package (DTEP) with email, tool-bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the scripts and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them and only do it when our team needs them as correct and usefull for the publication to make it a GPG / PGP key. this makes the source of resources guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload your passphrase for their private GPG-key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case you have several keys, you can check out the input fields (URL-preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the upload starts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can also be upload from the DTD DTD Package (DTEP), tool-like tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, we examine & quantitilus; the integrity of the resource by examining integrity and significance. if the integrity is given and the resource may be cancelled correctly, a message with the declaration of the originator is the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work with XML languages which is currently not yet produced by & quantaplus; however, it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files can be needed in the tag XML format. there's the easier way to convert DTD into a DTD package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD store and Convert to a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Name: the newly created & DTEP is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitions: the string which should appear in the DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus there are some key concepts. in order to understand these fundamental concepts and take advantage of this fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts, without their understanding & quantitilus; to bring little use to them.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantitilus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project. this distinction is concerned with a number of components in & quantitilus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; utilised. of toolbars about promotions is everything as global is marked in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this allows the group of administrators in different toolbars, actions and patterns of the global tree that are available to each in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are custom-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in user directory, so that they can only use such users.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns up to toolbars with special promotions specifically designed for the files of a specific project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are set out in the folder tree, and the joint use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project management.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some key areas: the Editorwindow, the building manners, the carteireside with information and the toolbars. please put in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the box with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all boxes, recharge, erase or upload of document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorde to another context menu regarding the processed documentation, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the word under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string is named under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors are the toolbars of the editor. at present & quantitilus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of tool bar is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantitilus; the toolbars will be adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bar is really easy. if they wish to insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the day. now, you can input the data for this straight day. if you want to add a day that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog box different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction sector (QIT;) enable it to navigate in the information & quantitilus; to navigate them to and through. in the representation with antlers stand for files, project, sample positions, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction materials are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitilus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project via the right mouse click. actions such as Add, Removing, High load or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out with the then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, programming, a whole website & etc; there are all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what it is used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more in templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information about a script. via the right mouse button you can start to edit, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-click of an element, the cursor position is set on the position of the element. by right-click of an element, a list of commands can be opened in terms of navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other buildings. with it, manfast attributes and namespace can change, which allows the change of all the available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for the web technology for your development. you can download the package documentation for & quantitilus; from the quantitilus; document documentation can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantitilus; two flashers at the bottom of the window, can be achieved above the useful information: the news window and the problem windows.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cartridge displays information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are indicated.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box-saver shows all errors in the check up of the current document. & quantitilus; scripts that are executed are all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The tool bars; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the toolbox of toolbar is the ability to define their own commands as an symbols in & quantitilus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with an email. & quantitilus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a tool bar in an email, they can secure them in & quantitilus; like any others secure and invite!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the & quantitilus; -files on your system. for this reason, autoconf might have a number of options to get the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. these options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at stake of & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that does not contain any older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantitilus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide range of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During an effort to create the best & coding, the developers of & quantitilus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, extendable Markup editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitilus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantitilus; for this is the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantitilus; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; development community is based on the outstanding efforts of free software, the idea of Why evolution is not only this possible, but allows users and developers, & quantitilus; so to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantitilus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can be increased productivity nearly every task. by the program Komíbles it can expand them & quantaplus; wield without any script language syntax. (more on this, they find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to an extended editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & quanta; connected. the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Conqueror; enter or run a helpcenter help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developing and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list from files that you have opened. this list changes every time, if you open a file that is not located on it, the eldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later usage. check in the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project presentation folder, will only be reported errors.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to insert from the clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; -write, so it is properly displayed and not used by the browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -write what the correct way to insert a special character and space character in & URL; s. first, add to the insertion of & URL; s into the anchor-day are used.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Automatically switches the option to or off. it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. an art grep or used word with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the news window, or not on. that's the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Discharge and enrollment of the problem reporters at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; the main window is activated once you replace the structure-tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol links left from the main window. this column allows you to set the bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in menu with entries predator or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu, according to the filenames of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantitilus; projects are saved with the file .webprj file.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presented a dialog to add files to the current project. the selected files are then copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that might be there. this allows for example to copy graphic files to your project file or a subfolder and add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Downloads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation options depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have further inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter and quantitilus projects, please refer to the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Downloads a project tool. these are kept in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your tool bar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by means of settings. toolbars are saved by means of toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removed a tool bar from the viewpoint. this does not delete it from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar still, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send their own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu option opens a new e-mail message with the tool bar than appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows high-load toolbars on the main server, where any other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; that you or someone else has done and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Unloading / uncover the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the departs are out of the & DTEP; if this is global, and write permissions in the global KDE file is not available, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a submenu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day-setup dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the menu, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or activates intelligent insertion tags. currently, this is only working with (X) HTML DTDs. smarter entry means that & quantitilus; add to the toolbar when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plug-ins under the above mentioned menu items are listed, click it. clicking on a activated plug-in disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Electing the syntaxies mode for the current file. the list of available articles schematics depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD document; by means of external use, tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate shutdown between different types of the user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switchover can sometimes need time or create unnice graphics. recommended is the card mode, which is also the default mode, or the bottom mode, which is the presentation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">Additionally, this menu contains one entry for each open subwindow. with a contract, the corresponding function will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar's status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main draw on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog can be used to use the KHTML part, including the & Conqueror; -Webbrowsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editors. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or which can change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">It should create a help according to the mouse's environment, but it is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitilus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free, but, as with any open source project, developers can always use aid. if they want to support the & quantitilus; developing in financial form, you will find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top of the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information can be completed later with Shift; F7 project Project Properties can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when typing of name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the expansion of webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine, which one wants to access, except for local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log can be used. depending on the remote controller, an adaptation must be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">That is the folder, in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">That is the folder, in which the tool bar will be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of the standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change. if scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Indicates if files located anywhere in the main file of the project are supposed to be included. if a project is started to rebuild, not touch.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of good-thin.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files located in the main folder. you can select the desired files due to anhaken or remove by removing the hamlet, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be upload or upload these settings in the menu with Project Properties in the menu-window, or with the shortcut Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders are possible), which will be reiterated in project-related operations like the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be reloaded with opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This enables you to select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. you can find more about Gubed. the debugger plug-in can be set with the button options. in this, the troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a supervision for the content of the server for each profile, which will restrict your own tree view to each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, one can add event actions and add these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed if a particular event occurs, such as the safest one file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior is currently not possible to influence.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool bar. the dialog project will open, and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantitilus; closed, the project file will automatically be stored. you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">There are free access to the files in the project. there, files can be administrated in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave just as well, however, entries are missing and opening up with... in conjunction with the right button of the context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile includes information about the location of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be hidden in order to prevent removing packages.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in memory and forget by program. this option is useful if common high uploading files is needed and the rather unsecure password on the plate is not stored in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue, when you change your opinion before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitilus; many upload profiles are created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded into different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialogue is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name that should copy the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for loading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and installed the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the Network administrator does not operate any service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them on the plate, so that it can't be read on the plate, but everyone with programmers can see it easily in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. by simply exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the project or project toolbar, accessible via settings of toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with whom one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows adjusting & quantitilus; to your own work mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantitilus; best above the toolbar's tool bar. use and add themselves. adding tool bar will be treated in the section adding of toolbars below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and the symbols on it can be set either by the context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which new action can remove, tool bar, rename or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog where actions can be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a promotion (icon) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and the promotion worked, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings of toolbars... and set the settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are made in essential documentation, code snip and files to link. & quantitilus; used templates as a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or each of the system available existing directory in the storage room. templates are set in & quantitilus; in about the restrictions you can set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantitilus; provided templates are conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be inserted any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually inserted in documents by linking (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples will be found in the storage room under global templates. more information about the templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. usually it makes a simple rumour for the purpose and organized the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in storage space under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is being included on a presentation but the same text area always included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the storage room under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are serving as templates. you are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantitilus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As Templates save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project-tree. look at the storage room under project conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on the File as Templates save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn simply with pulling and dismantling on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only copy in a template file. it can be used all file management functions for it, such as pulling and dismantling or inserting over the file-tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on the file tree or in the project file construction overview on a folder on the right and secure site template to secure a name for the presentation and secure. by default it is saved in the project file, but of course it can be saved as local or global presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project projects enable a very target-oriented approach. you can insert or attach dynamically to & PHP; design, insert files or link with them. in addition, you can put some things while using templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow Templates is based on the files generated in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder, click with the right mouse button on the folder and to select the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden as soon as indicated by the attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fit for everything except for the regular folders. if a regular folder would be disable unless they would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the Blah would appear with something like text-tree. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you to read or copy text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head lines / footer a full presentation already with matching head lines / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, we also have the context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantitilus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be accessed via the menu view. the first mode is replaced by the source editor by the VPL; Editor and the second mode: the source editor and the VPL; Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it downloads a document like normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor will appear. then you can edit and when needed for the source code editor, in which the changes contained in the VPL; editor is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with VPL; editor to a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandpresence of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor and PHP; there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first one, except for the changes both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously is running. with pressures of F9, this mode is already active, the button pressure transfer the active cursor over a window to suit, whereby the position is kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; Editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta; -view can be set between synchronisation after a click or automatically. if the selection is automatically switched on, the recommendation can be set to a quick host and a great span for slow computer.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to choose invisible tags in working with the VPL; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. it is intended to change the hacking code. so you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list allows change of the indescriped, e.g. key words on the column name and keyword key wort2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add css-rules with buttons below the list or delete. a change via the list is accurate as meta-elements is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and chooses the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used like in a word processing, through connection with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances, the cursor is peculiar. the marker works as usual. text can be inserted into typing and removed using the touch or distance paste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Insertion tags will be done in the same way as in the source editor, as in the source editor. it is to be aware that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. if an anchor-day, encircle with text, must be removed each other surrounding anchor.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables-assistant or the lists wizard are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; you'll have to work in this release the tables or lists toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the same. why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributions changed many changes and at the same time I had corrected the entry. another programmer had changed a lot in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">That from me the program showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what exactly had changed within this lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the entry had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; found differences in line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, just copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & cdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also, 3-way mergers will be fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently in one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the basis) helps to modify the correct result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screen photo shows three quantum files at merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you to merge the same and merge folder. this screen photo shows & cdiff3; with folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& Cdiff3; displays the precise differences and stimulates the possibilities of current color monitors. if you frequently need to check, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the summary at the left side on the left side. (no trouble if any one changes the entry notice).</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other differs in a row, the color indicates that file is different. red color means that both files distinguish.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder divider 2, folder safety 2 folder, folder 2 folder divider 2 folder divider 2 folder folder 3 -O target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The open dialogue allows the manual setting of filenames, the selection above the file browser (file...) or select a last open file from the back list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be introduced. if you select a file, for B and C but a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When Merging is crossed, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to determine an output file immediately. you can do this step later while saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set the options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare all the file but only parts of a text. & Cdiff3; allows you to pull text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in opening dialogue you must not select any files, you can simply connect the dialog to the breaking button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and dismantling: just draw a file from a file manager or selected text, and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains, for example, several similar functions. if you would like to figure out how to create these functions, this would be a relatively big effort. you would have to load two corresponding files, add them in & to diff3; now you can copy the relevant sections simply, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything & cover diff3; only the text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors will interpret the pulling and placing text in another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case your original data may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B, C, the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse to rest a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source codes are the letters A, B and C. a color blue, B and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one looks at the color, which file differs. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in settings). the colour scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding colour. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the processor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places, where the source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (under the comparators) also has a info line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [gechanges] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons to the next deleted / unrest conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, any difference is also a conflict of manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group's first line is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will appear. (this group will also be highlighted the current group in the background.) This group will appear at the background colour of background colour and on the left, a black beams appears on the left.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic mergers or by manual processing no further line remains in the group; then this text is displayed in the text; then you will change your mind, and perhaps a different source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marker you may copy and insert it elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; frame permits; however, appear in the clipboard if you copy the text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the sources, ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the picture-run and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are using in one of the window, you can also use the arrow keys, turn right, end, Strg-beginning and Ctrl-end, siw as you can also use of other programs. the overflow column next to the vertical image bar can also be used by clicking on the navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with insert key, you can switch between insert and overfishing mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A Click on the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the section) and the edit windows.</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference (Ctrl-down / Strg-picture), to the next / former conflict (Ctrl-Figure / Strg-picture) or to the next / former conflict. however, you do not automatically resolve the conflict as a conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unsolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you must automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this option is activated, the option is automatically copied and the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally file the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line-based devices are stored accordingly to the basis of the operating system. UNIX-based systems use a line-in-thrust-character\, and Win32-based systems use the line-driven C\\ r\. Kdiff3 retains the line-based source files, therefore you should use & cdiff3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of last used files are stored automatically and the next start is reproduced. (menu insert &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic writing. if the scripture is not supported, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be rendered. on these systems the button settings will automatically create an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the Tab key inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is activated, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. manual copying in the clipboard is then cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-type you prefer to save. the default value is the general choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all full-identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white signs are not ignored. even when merging, white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage drive '\' at the end of one line, others again store only one line-in '\' at the end of one line, but then you might save files with different sizes in the page-to-page comparison, but then you might have a white character. during the merging, this option must be disabled. this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis the numbers are ignored and associated signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default setting is disabled in default. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic start-up mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next unrest conflict is passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solve automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are used in many files. if you do not need to ignore the elects in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored, ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning the folders and execute a merge. check for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version is existing, then the original version is the Suffix .ore hung. if there is already such a backup file with the Suffix .original, it will be deleted without further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Matches the language of the interface. this option does not concern the current running program. you need to end & restart your current program. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set on the control centre in the KDE version.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if this option is enabled, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The code for the code appears a short indication of which the local code is. (this can't be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Watch the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted, because the coding for each file can be individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you have edited a file, you can specify which code should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they could not function with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing commands can only deal with 8-bit ASCII) By this option, you can define the encoding of output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress the changes in white characters in the text or overlooks. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a coded random column. but sometimes you would like to see only the differences between two of three files; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is indicated by the normal another one second transfer column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. get simply the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparative window to each other or above. this can also be useful for advertisements of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide unexpectedly to bring the files together. if you're using only two files. a simple click will start merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">In reading a file, it will be handed over to this external command. in & diff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor, which is exactly your requirements. for example, you can use this function, for example, to disconnect parts or to correct loading.</seg>
<seg id="2350">In reading a file, it is handed over to this external command. if a normal preparation command was specified (see above), then the command is used to write this preliminary processor. you can only write your own preprocessor, which corresponds to your requirements. each entry line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to enable users more flexibility when setting up the Diff's results. however, an external program requires, and most users don't want to program it even though. the Good news is that, in most cases, sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this process commands for line-off to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ U\\ 1\\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is a found expression on each string which refers to the found text in the first row couple.\\ U converts the found text in upper case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Using CVS and other version control systems, use some keywords to insert strings from the same pattern (info @ cvs / Keyword substitution). therefore, the\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with used, you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for further processing commands for Zeilenabequals suitable. sed "s / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hits is replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to perform several episodes at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate each other from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of used, you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -E's / REGEXP / Error / switch 'allergy is different at perl a few details. if used\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and merge. the further operations change only the data, which sees the line equal to algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the issue of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as in any function, the text changed or hidden, you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. from that reason you can compare with & cdiff3; complete folder reitalic and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a proposal to merge; you may adapt the proposal to the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without it really accomplish,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparisons and merge of individual files. you only need to open folder on command line or in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder is specified, use & diff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merging. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform you a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files are listed, that were compared to then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning is complete, shows & diffuse diff3; a catalog window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder was found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed manually by clicking on + / -, or double-click on the object, or by using the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory contains two functions, open all the subdirectories and valves, with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column Name reflects the file type in the first file (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane shown on the selected object. in such a case, the merhr operation can't be chosen automatically. if the merging is started, you will be informed about problems of this type once again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above image, in the columns A / B / C the colors Red, Green, Yellow and Black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is identical, even when the age of entries are different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be considered identical if all of its content is identical. then also folder the same color. with folders, the age is infinitely for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colours of a sheet that is only green, then yellow will and later when it is old, is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such corrupt objects, the merge can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such corrupt objects, the merge can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were given, and if the option is synchronized active. then choose & b diff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merging and the result in both folders. (the user looks like the visible field names for output file only B; directly after merging copies & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the option of new file instead of merging (unsure), then examines & kdiff3; the date files are different, but the same date feature appears, but the date is identical.. While such mistakes are not removed, the merge does not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is processed after the others. if the assembly has been successful, and correspondingly different messages, if something unexpected is completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is fine.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When described in the setup dialog, the file comparative Analysis is selected, KDiff3 will display other columns. these include the number of monasteries, solvent, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for solving conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either assemble either the selected entry (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all summarize actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have any target folder, then in three-folder merge mode C is used as target, while two-folder merge is B as the target and when synchronize, A and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options to avoid unlovable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring together all entries: select directories, proceed in the directory, or press F7 (the key shortcut). in order to bring together only the current record: choose Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If using contradictory data types are still incomplete, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you assemble all entries, a dialog window appears with the options, simulate and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">If you want to see what would happen, if you want to see what really changes will happen, you will get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& Cdiff3; then runs certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (together a single file), then a merging window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select again / proceed or press F7. if you are not yet saved, a proper dialog appears. then & kdiff3 will continue his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & cdiff3; on a mistake, a message and detailed status information is displayed. at the end of the list you will see some errors that will help you to try out the cause of the problem. thus, you have the opportunity to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries are individually summarised, please note & cdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not lead them together. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be done as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries are regenerated again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified patterns are displayed in the element tree. you can replace the pattern with a semicolon; valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separating characters. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separating characters. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatisch generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be specified with an .cvsignal file. (check out at info: / cvs / cvsignals.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem files, files are an attribute. in other filesystem selected files a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element-tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links are treated as normal folder and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions) would lead to an end loop and & cdiff3; crashes off.) This option is switched on default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file through and shows the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unelasteries, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower, if it is applied to files containing no text (specify an appropriate Anti-Pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders via a slow network, it's possibly faster than to compare the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security. please use with caution. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to Confidence the date of change. it is no real comparison. the files are considered equal when copying the date of alterations has been lost. please use caution with caution. this option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder. in this mode the proposals are identical. the results from merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as a promotion. (this will be considered uncertain as the other file has not been changed.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .origines already exists, so it will be deleted without another backup. this also applies to normal merging single files, not just the merging dfolder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge-merge tool remains visible to the merging single files; you can turn the divider divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can turn the main window in the window menu and switch through the switch between Directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file via double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory. once you can store the file, the status is set to be done, and the file will not again run together if you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status comes down if you re-read the directory: directory -menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undone or.. contain. it's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the server system on the server, sometimes by the used protocol, it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished, if a link is shown on a file or a folder. then, it will always be adopted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no option to edit permissions, or change of change. therefore, authorizations or change of change from the original. (note this option is confidentiality of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop will always start the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part advertisements from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part file, it decreases & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files needs to exist. then start & kdiff3; program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the convex file, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu in - Kdiff3Part. note that this does not work if not the original files exists. furthermore, it is unreliable when the original files have changed since creating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & cdiff3; as part performed, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or comparisons of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now are Compare) there are already. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge the diff3 program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and I've learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that have gone this way or go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script not the right PREFIX to KDE. at default, configure / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you can find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line will not be treated as the same as not identical. iF similar lines of next to Each other, this bleis: this shis often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers for any difference in the files where he starts and ends. this important information is necessary, however, if the result is easily stored as text file, and it is too much effort to design an extra own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far too big. you can restore a specific version of using a source A / B / C using selecting a source A / B / C. another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly fixed; no src lins; appeared and the text cannot extinguish. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& Cdiff3; already uses many colors to increase differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the game Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To utilize all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You will find a list of the latest changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the quota package.</seg>

<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automaker use you should not have problems with compiling. should still occur difficulties, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or reverse-removing) copies into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Umschalt paste) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position, or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure, and consequently, not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to read the folders with the function Update) to these options.</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed if the differences are correct. if the target folder will not already be copied to the target folder. if the target folder will not already be copied. (the behaviour will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is switched on default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Notice the buttons to choose from the source with the labelling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are already present), if the lines are already present, they will be returned to the button on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differentials in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual environments. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to change their size, to end them or move it. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual environments as well as the applications. applications can be selected and even be moved to desktop and other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & Kpager; it is possible to use both within a desktop and also on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked; if on the empty background of & Kpager; however, the context menu will only appear only the two entries of pager... and end. if however, on an application within & Kpager; it also appears the symbol and the name of the application and the entries minimize, maximize, on Desktop and Finish. these commands have the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of your desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & Kpager can appear: classic lets & Kpager; in a 2xn-grid appear, like pager applications in some other windows managers; horizontally, all virtual machines in a horizontal row shows all virtual machines in a vertical range, which is very good for the presentation at the side of desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with their content and move. moreover, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and followed by selecting the switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>

<seg id="2500">To get it clearer again: even if & kmousetool; pain means that when pressed with the mouse, it is against pains that are caused by the moving because of the mouse, useless. and, as it is applicable to all ergonomic tools, the result may be different for anyone.</seg>

<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can reduce the response time. go to sound & multimedia, select there sound system and click here the tab. there is a shift sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>

<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it's necessary to reduce the response times by & KDE.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should realize what places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral installation of windows or on places in the browser window, which does not display link, does not lead to unintentional reactions. you may use the mouse to such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is buck, you should make your mouse clean. that's usually quite simple. the trick is there that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that comes into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must take out the mouse ball. as it happens, mouse is different from mouse. it should be fast clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole, into which the ball was used. the threshing and dirt can easily scrape them with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system uses the design of & kmousetool; if you have just started a shift in this case, means that & kmousetool does not mean anything by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you're using & kmousetool; using a window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists that you can run a mouse click here. this is the status of & kmousetool; recalled and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & mmousetool; continue to execute clicks and set the cursor over another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop if you don't want to cause a keypresses. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey surfaces for the toolbars and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent compress, but I don't make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent compress is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you want to bypass it into the clipboard or to move, in which you want to move the mouse when pressed mouse button. but it will probably try to cause some problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent compress if you just start to use & kmousetool; instead of using a mouse button and hold the switch-pressing key, while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and restart the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this way, when & kmousetool; the mouse button is played a sound like a mouseclick. so, you know exactly when using intelligent compress the vershocking time begins. later, you can also use the intelligent compress without the audible mouseclick. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to use & mmousetool; use the XTest Add-in for & X Window; that should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouclicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker, and these are set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The issue of Screen Reduction has the highest priority. it will be drawn to all other contracts, and keeps these orders. if the edition of the Screen Reader is read, the orders received resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news as & eg; processor becomes too hot. a warning has priority, and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News, the next second highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example for an application to read the messages. while you & eg; add a long text on a web site, you can enter with & kmouth; someone welcome, who enters the room. & KDE; notifications are also news. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple textrecords. each order you encounter with the card orders, is a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that have written assignments. texts are intended for the issue longer texts that have no particular drum.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, with the exception of the issue of screen reels. if an application reads the output of a Screen Readers, while & tts, just a such reads, this edition will stop and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the issue of screen refunds. you will be applied to normal warnings, news, and text orders as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter editing the text and pass it to the next filter. currently there are three kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are done as modules. in the future, it can still be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Text file replacing parts of a text by other text. these parts can be delivered either as words or regular expressions. it is provided with pre-defined type text files, which make the release of chat emotions such as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & networkconf; a module for the & control center, which allows the management of network interfaces, the routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. it can be called by K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & networkconf; package has been developed to facilitate users the management of TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & control network; allow for the user a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be displayed; the module Network Settings (networkconf;) can be launched by selecting from kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & networkconf; the device is shown at all and allows network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices for installing & linux; installed and installed. network appliances later have to be added, the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files, accordingly the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is loaded when you select network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network, this platform is automatically recognisable to detect the used platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the same selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release date is best. due to marking the setting non-re-question the ceremony can be permanently hit. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings is possible only in system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means settings can only be viewed, modifying changes mode at the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password mode at the right bottom of the module.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the module's total functionality is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface interfaces can be used to manage network appliances. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Select network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. Click to click the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of automatic, the TCP / IP settings are collected by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP address is required for each system startup, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list either DHCP or BOOTP should be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Selecting the manual can be done without DHCP or BOOTP or the TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initiates the network interface in the booting. if the initialization is not allowed, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values are displayed in this dialog as the features of the device in the device-box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network. ping into the IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping into the & Console, you may determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network appliances may be activated or switched on, depending on demand. switching a marked network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network appliances may be activated or switched on, depending on demand. disable a activated network device with selecting from the list and click the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other substitution.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is available more than a network interface, the interface must be connected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org is required to DNS this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the name resolution part of the name resolution allows for a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a contract and execution or reclassification in the list with buttons up or down in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking button1 click the button calculator to add a DNS server. it will be added to the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button adding. entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group machine to choose the naming solution, select one entry and then click on the button Edit. it is displayed in the dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list known as computer-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily by boat if no DNS servers are available. in small, enclosed network, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of well-known computers contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some specific IPv6 addresses. this is still in the current version of IP to replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known host and click on adding.... the dialog New alias is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes, you must set the following command in one & Console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & networkconf; is http: / / knetworkwork.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE are installed and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one & Console; with rpm, how to install:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphic surface such as a package, or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">The installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient for this case, not, but in addition, the development packages begin with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to use users. however, it is not difficult to compile & networkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given over basic network technology, in the second all are discussed by & networkconf; changed configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This segment can't replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operating with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). 5 has never seen great spread. IPv6 is expected to prevail in the near future. therefore, this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is to assign to a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; workplaces is the network administrator to respond to a valid IP address, if available, the IP address can not be selected randomly!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When putting an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address control with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so it's possible to use it.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be used for such machines through the setting of Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are commonly used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is usually fixed at 255.255.255.0, so all the hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for the IP transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section the configuration files are listed, which are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are discarded in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered at DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is any other content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand is expected to occur.</seg>

<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, log & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the individual protocol-lines of a protocol-file can easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start to start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol-file of the system - to open it. if you don't have a small news window, you'll see & ksystemlog; very likely do not have a system verwalterright. the protocol files are normally found in folder / var / log, for normal users normally not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar in order to filter out the filter bar according to a selected criterion. in the default setting, the list of the protocol list will be displayed next to the filter record. then, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns containing the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another record, of course, select another record. select the text protocol, then select the column process, and you can also select it in the filter bar the name of a process, so you will show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default and helps to recognise the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of Level error are displayed with a remarkable colour as protocol lines of levels. the colour presentation of protocol-lines can be switched on setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show a certain process (e.g. in system protocol or in cron protocol), you can test the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can then be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines at the main window menu, in order to display all new addition of the new lines-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows viewing multiple protocol files in separate signposts. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindow. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find more current information about the sources of sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also available in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; im & KDE; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly developed as the standard for the control of the start-up of the system in the & Linux world. this is why it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it either: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is why someone might try to setup a machine on system V init without installing a reinstalling and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">SYSV Init also differs from BSD input, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc, instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service, which you want to restart the system or change to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial / etc. these calls include according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie in part under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it does not have a lot of use for it. you can also create rc.co.in / etc / rc.d if you want to run out something, what to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can change to / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a bit passed through, then you will repairing it by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start with all the correct scripts? if you can -l enter in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? simply: each of the scripts is written so that it's an argument as startup and stop. you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if that includes a K, the script will stop using the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will be called by the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish you a simple way to align machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server run-level, that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. moreover, I could have a user -Runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start it (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts between Runlevelling or shift the position within one level by changing it elsewhere. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or his position). this happens only if they move an entry from the disposition of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved, if you prefer this into a new area. to just copy it onto a new runlevel, you must select explicitly copy from the menu Edit menu and in the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number can sometimes be calculated sometimes. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tulator button to enable the various working ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection below or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry in another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change sorting number or the name of one entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. connect the dialog by refutes the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are reproduced by & ksysv; the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevelling, and now the machine restarts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Put the lilo Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The species, as system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for proprietary components of these distributions, but is unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an expansion of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In case you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are required (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply without notice if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & to user; 1.0. you can manage the users and groups of your system using this program.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have done any changes, you have to save this. either you are using the corresponding icon of toolbar or the entry in the file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, user and user group list. for Edit, select the desired user or the desired group with double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you can make extended system settings. only if you can make custom constraints (Quota) for users, you will be able to make individual settings. further flashcards appear if Shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card passport control appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This cartridge card is only activated and initialized for at least one-inserted filesystem (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable in the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, each user can change parameters, with the limitation of information in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set separately for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field-restriction field system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The antitantcard groups informs about the group inheritors of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, find in the binary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by mark this in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog features a list of all users to add a user to group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select the user or group or click on the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group as analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the lilo-boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to the boats of the standard operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, change and more.</seg>
