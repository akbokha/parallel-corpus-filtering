although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely large .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American authors have read and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist for an American film .
when the 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he was playing the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who discovered the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ um , who wanted to over@@ turn his interest in the Supreme Court of Justice , who wanted to occupy his interests .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people .
I even had a very swelling message about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump arrived .
much has been written about the tourist attraction and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops behind the mountain , as they say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he considers , as a former colleague put it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ mal@@ er and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republican Presi@@ dential elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ otto person , I asked ?
I was not able to know Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , people from all over the world , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Welt@@ anschau@@ ung also voted by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present author of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; published .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; on the game .
tr@@ um@@ ps In@@ toler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity due to Sandy B@@ ahr , which strug@@ gles with Sandy B@@ ahr , strug@@ gles for their lives for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with much patience and suffering from me and my colleagues helped to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then , there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise council helped me much in my career .
these people and those with them em@@ bodied values deep@@ ened my love toward America .
while Tr@@ ump moves his way to the nominated Republican Presi@@ dential candidate , they offered me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 there were over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the idea of the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it &apos;s un@@ fair the t@@ ump voters to be regarded as ro@@ assi@@ sts .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears of hec@@ tic changes are not taken into account in their communities .
could it be that those elec@@ tors , of which most white are , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe . maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commenting on the cru@@ el@@ ly decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( an@@ em@@ y . ) means : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities , &quot; Word match made white in playing on the White and W@@ hi@@ pl@@ ash , which means such as big Van Jones , has exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you like always have , America is always welcome .
for this country chose the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ man twice as his president , his story , as he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise to say : to Hell with vers@@ atility , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ru@@ d@@ der , say they .
in all this I have to think to K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who is in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , &quot; my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; bru@@ ises the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos offer a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called and their voices were loud .
&quot; would anyone not , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your United States . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was fallen , he sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , the news said .
and all the people like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and it breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
the music that is played at both places does not only change the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists - but worlds away from the nearby iconic ruins and its iconic cuisine .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ ker ) has been playing in the community : one of children and adults of existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which , with its musical instruments , has an opportunity to overcome them to overcome them .
a music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poo@@ rest provinces of Mexican , is known for their drugs abuse and the ban@@ kers .
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI compl@@ ains :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue its great passion .
they are always laugh@@ ing and playing with shining eyes and play in the action you learn day for trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from litter
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital of Paraguay , on instruments which are made of recovered waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments , which consist of local firm waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under management of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trumpet and percussion .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local wine c@@ ologist and music teacher , reminds of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time :
first of all , it was very difficult because we did not have a place to rehear@@ se and we worked at the same point where parents worked in the litter . children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact her parents , because many of them live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something , which he had never seen before : one out of waste produced violin .
today , there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments made of re@@ prepared material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary on &quot; Land@@ s Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage de@@ duct ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poo@@ rest - like people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .

these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can tackle the illegal fishing industry

this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted over international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication occurs in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on shared use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had been operated by illegal fishing fishing in Liberia before the other African coast travelled to Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly raised and til@@ ted slightly , to welcome a criminal crimin@@ als of this kind in their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobi@@ lized quickly against the ship . they refused to add one of their har@@ bors and refused to share a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch there fish .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , due to a pre@@ dation of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and conservation of resources was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal fishing ( underground fishing stop ) .
the members of this network , besides Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries , which then had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden , which is extremely difficult to track . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate contemp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain living spaces and types are protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can damage which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were imp@@ eded by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , with the information between different countries , the actions nowadays happen in real @-@ time , tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange programs existing lic@@ ences , news to susp@@ ect activities or details , which you noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive , when moving these on the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables the authorities to mark ships that fishing in banned areas - such as those who indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on other ships .
in the ideal case , such examinations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing licence , where they were on the way , and possibly even if they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing are based on this information then inform@@ ing such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot be sold their load . and that they could even be forced to pay a number of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an ex@@ ert company that sets up for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also includes F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales in order to lose the eight members of the network of H@@ ISH - each year due to the illegal f@@ ishers to penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing in all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
among other practices including actions , such as the sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying ph@@ antom so@@ res , fish @-@ protected species and fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &quot; . &quot; and just this legal conclusion is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks , which had distributed counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has pursued vol@@ atile ships and found .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Authority for Crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over big distances .
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations show us quite far in the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to provide susp@@ icious ships of precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , helps to hide the illegal vessels that are like to hide .
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , Head Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ge@@ ort@@ et by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence on this without doubt a global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oce@@ anic Organization : a platform that provides satellite data , and it can be shown worldwide with the position of each en@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , with which a global system permits the persecution of ships .
there is evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not just crimin@@ als but it can also deter them .
ships that were f@@ ished with no license earlier without license , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH compet@@ i now account for a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats gain more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the insp@@ ectors found there on board locks , whose use is forbidden .

other countries will be aware of these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa there disappear several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries joined the West Africa Task Force for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country in Somalia was able to report its first major triumph in October : in October , it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used with tow@@ ing nets , which are now prohibited .
the ship was also entered into prohibited waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the Acc@@ ept@@ ing of Meas@@ ures to Gre@@ ko 1 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that a special , collabor@@ ative approach to protection of the oceans really works throughout the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .

the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the low@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ centre of the federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , what makes it noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of fundamental change in the official launch of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises to the latest article in the context of government regulation :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate and ant@@ al@@ tr@@ ates are estimated to increase food and medicine , the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to conquer its institutional structures and to join a new government alliance .
the nom@@ ination of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Party ) , the demonstr@@ ators gathered to join the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , as well as a march to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ elan leader , planned on November 3rd , should continue to continue the blocking of the referendum on mandate .
the appeal was commented on Twitter , amongst others , as follows :
it is in Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national strike and on 3 November all flights to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The retreat of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , published in real time , bear witness of an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but disp@@ utes with police officers and supporters of the government .
one of the most common images shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the protective signs : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; she cri@@ es al@@ oud of the Vene@@ tians .

on Twitter , images which tell about disp@@ utes , as well as reports of supp@@ ression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news about police fires in the central @-@ north @-@ centre of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the protest@@ ers return to the local cathedral there , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police force , including this woman in the state of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira ;
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear RÃ¶@@ cke , because you could not see something many national parks !
meanwhile , a Inf@@ ographic is already making the round , which de@@ forms the extent of oppression per day :
so the dictatorship had supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counter@@ balance method - this was now demonstrated in the presence of many thousands of people on the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s &amp; Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sign@@ atures are fake .
here is your ten@@ tion !
on the road !
other analyze this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that made a little bit against the devastating depression and prefer@@ enti@@ ally occupied some critical voices :
they took us so much - but the fear !
the fair@@ yt@@ ale always take more frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media to participate in an hung@@ arian , in order to participate in a strike , instead of working or purchase .

this is a adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ x@@ ano , which was unveiled on 23 August 2016 to D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and was published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano was forced to attend the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean town of Cordoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ x@@ ano , in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in Cordoba came up against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were committed to crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano is not looking for his life .
starting with the office , the same name as His Father contribute to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , whom he observed at the age of 15 he has suffered enough .
for 34 years , he maintained family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realise that my father was a thief , a mur@@ derer , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ sen@@ e@@ officials . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ ano , the oppressed who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , in the course of the years , knew the extent of atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy , and who had said before a Bundes@@ geri@@ chtshof ) against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to join me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts .
all they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that they will not lead you one day , and I must save you .
the short ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
so he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father walked me .
on the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured &apos; .
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wra@@ pping piece in a blanket , and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down and stopped with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I went in and saw a Lie@@ ge which were tortured on people .
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later , I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was ti@@ led there .
they tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ threw him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ Ã³n Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the smell there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty sound .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same od@@ our came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father participated in the work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried to their eyel@@ ids .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , an civilians who also was indicted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people lay down on the face down - all were bound at hands and feet .
in the entrance of the squ@@ ashed people quietly on the matt@@ resses .
when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I thought &quot; Why have you ever brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and put down by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed one man .
( according to data from survi@@ vors ) Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was also indicted by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way , where you came in here , is also the way that came down here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of empt@@ ying a number .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be re@@ located .
this was the lie - the Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for shooting the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war troph@@ ies &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things to go home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war troph@@ ies &quot; - how they called it .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war troph@@ ies are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military de@@ marks , which one has fought against an enemy .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , it is not a war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I was always asked about how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crimin@@ als and I answered : and you , who put on the street in the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried :
when you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory to him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that , on which I wore a jacket and a sk@@ irt of wool . I had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time the defence asked me to have been a fellow at this crime . I rep@@ lied , no problem , they can lay hands on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ icious act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ented .
I have children . if one only has children , one knows the value of a lifetime .
one develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
so well , you ex@@ termin@@ ate men during the dictatorship , but for what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children bring children ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
but it would have been simply put to prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but for what is their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
were these people not also families who could not pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ical act that you can do for a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , which show my father , arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to be experienced for him .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
I felt advent@@ u@@ rous , and asked me why all the excessive patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
he only said , &quot; No , I show me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I posted the first indication .
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
no one can suggest that I am dre@@ ad@@ ful . I finally spoke against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano died in May 2015 , under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes : including heavier , un@@ lawful imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping one under 10 years of age .

the sentences in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the particle size of the judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process was completed because of crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 agents were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court sentenced to life sentences in 28 cases and sentenced in 28 cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ al .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape as well as officers . # Es@@ al@@ state terrorism
all def@@ endants were , during the dictatorship of the military , including former military operations , former police officers and civilian employees .
in June 1976 , Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death @-@ factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for justice for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentine organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , represents the children of people who were killed or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , Argentina &apos;s government issued the country on which La Per@@ la was located there , so that a memorial was built there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; dre@@ ad@@ able car &quot;
the sign with translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was distributed in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto &apos;s Kyoto &apos;s Kyoto , customers have been granted a newly opened centre in which to extend its driving license , last month witnesses a very special translation .
on a sign the Japanese word spread ( ko@@ rei@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older motor@@ ists , &quot; probably fal@@ sely - maybe - but also with mal@@ ign@@ ant backgrounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; .
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic advertis@@ ements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the mistake had been a translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was it too , who was attentive to the local newspaper .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n , Kyoto , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it be such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
the f@@ law@@ ed English translation has been removed first . the name &quot; Show@@ dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; horri@@ ble drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate if the gramm@@ atical name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) was replaced .
the Kyoto &apos;s police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text , which they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked on their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blog@@ ger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt due to in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on the other hand , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ fully &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents are due to concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors . this is equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , seniors took 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of deaths caused by seniors caused the same period in the same period .
the emin@@ ent not mentioned reporter delivered in the version of article comments to the light which show the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this the ( &quot; terri@@ fic motor@@ ist &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that it is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true mine for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
for transfer@@ ring , one requires two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and the active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is in native language . generally , the conviction is that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native languages .
for example , a French native speaker was translated into French by English - not from the French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese company employ no staff with English as a mother tongue , who could just@@ ify the translations into English . this may be a lack of understanding for the over@@ taking , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers , Japanese language .
some companies who even have no foreign employees , do not leave translations to just@@ ify themselves . then , the Japanese company , whose English knowledge is considered the best to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the dist@@ orted and myst@@ i@@ fying pro@@ positions that arise through machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the pec@@ uli@@ sts English gra@@ c@@ aries in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints , who often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for sty@@ list@@ ical reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable , acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by great companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translation .
the Kyoto &apos;s city will hopefully use a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : to take protests and ci@@ on measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezu@@ elan Internet user would have no access to the online station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet has no longer access to V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV as well .
other online broad@@ casts carried out recordings of the protest in Caracas that were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , opposed to the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April when the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tractor . he pointed out that the connection is on to use and receive users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ elan provider is imprisoned again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially at times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been set for protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened to report them with fin@@ es and closure , if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
ast@@ oun@@ ding that it is still cheaper than to buy two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two additional online broad@@ caster . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
previous research by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet providers inf@@ lic@@ ts up to the DNS . thereby , it is a technique that assi@@ sting the DNS servers of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website .
we confirm a DNS locking : @ el@@ lim@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who transmitted the protests in Caracas to Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in custody for custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV returned to broadcast .
although some channels still have access to YouTube , it has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : so that the Vene@@ tians will always be able to find access to multi @-@ media coverage about the current events in the country .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by the curator who will be published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly auth@@ orization of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ Å¡@@ que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , waste schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America and will be re@@ published .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not staying with the family that was living there .
shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly talked about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the one that has become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as Cri@@ ad@@ itas , one designated in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 girls and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money over their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head .
what does not mention , however , is that the children have to pay for many days of home@@ work that will never be paid or abuse of abuse and abuse , and all of that in the context of a contract you cannot raise .
this , as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go , practice in Paraguay is widespread in Paraguay due to its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating from her study , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are concerned by the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - gathered witness testim@@ oni@@ als , den@@ ounced and den@@ ounced .
she attempted to call the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated with cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is , on the one hand , the family , who exclu@@ de her daughter in the faith that they will improve their education , improve their position in society and &quot; something out of himself &quot; is over to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes care of itself and just@@ ifies the exploitation by faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
when the girl becomes mist@@ re@@ ated , his family will experience its family many years later .
sometimes they never experience them .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , received a vision .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came into the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body presented vest@@ iges of heavy stro@@ kes . shortly after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who , as an official at the residents of residents .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
on the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira reached a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered a fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girls .
a few days later the media reported about incident .
she emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the grave responsible for the death of the girl in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society . Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is responsible for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest meetings and told that there is &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay should be .
the name of the girl and photographs were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it &apos;s very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations demanding a generous investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had her Cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark , if the case of the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go ahead of judgment .
the Life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for workers , they are also isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to en@@ rol and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the work and began selling on the road or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , it had to be able to share the time that you still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
on Fri@@ days she cle@@ av@@ ed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and un@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at an end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was finished with learning , the more free time it had .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinners for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been star@@ ving , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the househ@@ older than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she remembers .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the bud@@ get@@ ary , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who belonged to power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some depart@@ ures of the bud@@ sman Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and Editorial from Opp@@ os@@ ities , such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; to read .
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
he kept it for intelligent , but did not say with her . &quot; the master of the house had someone to listen while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they were not often allowed to visit my family , because they believe that I would learn there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak to their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they were able to lose the education they would lose , explains them .
it was quite clear , however , that she had paid for everything they got paid with their hard work .
even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ik@@ anas which Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed if they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time , where friend@@ ships origin@@ ate , I felt particularly clearly that I was in any group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the society appro@@ v@@ ices the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share priority for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in As@@ unci@@ on district .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small companions for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please refer to you .
starting on Monday , if possible .
the display received five &quot; lif@@ es &quot; and many comments .
a woman in Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a f@@ th girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the inner inner that wants to work &quot; was written .
then the editor takes place once again :
dear girl@@ friends , I found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the shop was finished .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , as long as ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies , ex Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ada@@ z@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ( which the workers had to be considered as Hal@@ b slaves ) and the natives were willing to re@@ adily make that many girls and boys become aware of slavery , in which they become a slight sacrifice for abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show@@ case of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomena known as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go .
bill to register Egyptian users social media to register in the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian members of Parliament recently ordered a bill to &quot; regul@@ ating the regulations on the use and utility social networks . &quot;
if it is accepted by Parliament , users must register users to use social media in Egypt from a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
based on the law then a job would be established , which is t@@ asked to share a permit to share social media citizens .
within six months of acceptance of the law , user would have to register users and users on the site of the site with their right names and number of personnel numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , this could be a penalty of up to six months in jail or money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced , as it is believed to be imposed by the law , as the Egyptian authorities are to prove the user &apos;s users and users that are not to be registered in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the government regulation is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , par@@ liam@@ ents and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name and users received a user name and a password in order to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for all the Egyptians , Egyptians , to access their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now , that such plans consist .
experts and experts on @-@ site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Strategy &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion it is so consistent that , as they were able to control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
when I take it seriously , then it means that they will apply a strong monitoring system to un@@ lock citizenship , or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to bring it to a judicial process .
this is technically realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees , before the debate has to be deb@@ ated .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; is in harmony with a per @-@ military reas@@ oning in parliament , in whose senses the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no sof@@ ter Nar@@ ration is present on the surface area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
in the past year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ Hawai@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime against Cy@@ ber crime , which was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order , &quot; and &quot; to protest to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in nor@@ theastern Iraq , the shelter H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the NGO &apos;s non @-@ governmental organisation work to protect the spirits of Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the leop@@ ard family , native to Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to wild waste , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , as they always find less prey .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory food in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem , and the health and the mar@@ riages of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in fact is small and goes against zero . as the team is in the video , so that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera all , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
as an educated bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately like another side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and an educational programmes of Nature Iraq .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group , and is preparing to make shelter for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .

six years after the tsun@@ ami : the status of things in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate

Shi@@ zu@@ ga@@ wa was destroyed by the tsun@@ ami on 11 March 2011 and continues to re@@ build the region .

in early March 2017 , documented by the nor@@ theastern Japan , daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to re@@ construct the life of the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its seat in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tual pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring countries of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to leave , because the tsun@@ ami struck all the coastal towns of the map .
while Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture have experienced a nuclear accident , some of them had to leave its houses 160 000 inhabitants .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows a local view which progress has been reached six years later in order to re@@ construct the lives of local people .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ organization and the survey results of the affected themselves .
the construction situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that up to dec@@ ember 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( show@@ cases , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima at 70 percent provides the final light .
nevertheless , we always stri@@ ve to accomod@@ ate six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ el &apos;s accommodations ( mer@@ gers , Kaz@@ an su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to fin@@ alize the final substitute .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to endure .
in December 2016 , there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such comfort .
in 2011 , almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated , which have been replaced after the disaster in residential homes , have been moved to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of fish@@ eries in I@@ w@@ ates and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have returned its operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident damaged in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic failure , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed crops of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , the tourism has recovered far back , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima goes far off .
tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as in front of the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to obtain a complete picture , the newspaper conducted a number of surveys among the native people and among the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of reconstruction and even as their feeling has changed over the tsun@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami awareness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ amis .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of respondents think that still not enough used in disasters prevention .
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture
in her edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has intensi@@ fied its attention also on the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was a witness to the worst , disaster victims , atomic accident , Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were located in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , returned to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , a long @-@ term spare parts .
after the 2017 stand still live , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ es , most of the evacu@@ ation areas are more than 50 years old . it is known to rec@@ ir@@ ate , because efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ates and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive building projects . this is the projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be bigger than the common areas .
after a while , however , it is often noticeable that more than it seems to appear at first sight .
these global links are important since they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , extend our perspectives and recall that the world is however very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at all these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we will treat topics that often get fewer attention in reporting , than they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over speech and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa is thinking about how the love for music has worked on the lack of joint speech during a journey in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva are on a widespread photo .
this week , a Brazilian student at the age of 33 , was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer was defeated in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a strike against the head . nationwide millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the university of the university Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ul@@ ls of brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors oper@@ ded him on this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that rapidly spread in Brazil during a few days .
on the pictures , the face of police officers is also recogni@@ zable by a striking attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the preliminary investigation of the investigation of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer arrested a protest@@ ers and landing at the intensive care station , his face would be seen for six months in television and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a newspaper @-@ channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video from Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , to see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and subsequently sharing several San@@ itary forces .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet user has now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ lians in another state ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to provide a family in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor of Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violent attacks against activists in the Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence . here , the activist Irish was murdered by his father because he sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary School , and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who was attacked on an intensive care center after he has been attacked by police officers , who has sm@@ itten him on his face .
police Transfers
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it came to protest@@ ant police officers in the last Friday .
polic@@ emen were sitting on the protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against protest@@ ers in the number of speakers .
there is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again the Brazilian media scra@@ pped road protests by pushing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a window disk .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo was aimed specifically on a frag@@ ile glass windows to illustr@@ ate the illustr@@ ative pages .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title @-@ story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic foundation , more about a broken shut@@ down than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also recognize , if one is stri@@ ving against any form of damage .
even here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate significance , and the typical non@@ violence of the military police are made by head@@ lines with the title &quot; protest@@ ers on con@@ frontation with the police . &quot;
the ad@@ ditions of un@@ induc@@ ing villages in Cuba
by introducing the introduction of the Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Pop@@ ular Con@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of what there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were put in the sugar tube factory .
after replacing the sugar cane in the region stood still , and the factory lost to and after its plants , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete was left .
approximately 272 workers had to be re @-@ inv@@ ent .
some change the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ utes daily to the factories which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a solo env@@ y that ris@@ eth every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar tube industry doesn &apos;t smoke out of sleep .
he heard that there are sugar production factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time they were in operation , because they were preserved .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remembers hearing exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar tube industry has already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administration decisions , and climate change .
in 2016 production 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the production produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country in a few decades ago , but bad harvest@@ ers are no more .
why was the Cuban sugar cane disabled ?
the old train station of the village saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the shred@@ ding of the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar tube plants were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly more competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production deficit was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations , and the growth of sugar on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price grew before about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report issued in 2016 &quot; Agriculture Organization &quot; from the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
during the following years , a total of 98 million sugar production factories , more than 65 million people got their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , talking about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated the most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all those questioned agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
to obtain the place , they formed a full time - working group .
prior to the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written about documents that would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed , ad@@ ress@@ ate and the date .
all of them were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could prove every discharge .
from then on , the responsibility and letters came often more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ closed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still existing sugar factories , &quot; he as@@ sures us .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the dis@@ closure of the factory , whose construction he helped .
in each part , which he removed , he dis@@ counted one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and its main workplace was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases no alternatives were made for the work@@ places and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut of Mamm@@ ut of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed to have been in operation for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years .
the price of the population for closure of the sugar cane
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only by p@@ olls .

after two years , the popular community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always to the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane closed , or better said it , when they began to disman@@ tle them , they also listened to , the road to asph@@ alted , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they have been to spare parts .
apart from the future , many young people left the region at once .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for supplying the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility remains impressive .
in late 2016 , N@@ ene was back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years of retirement , not because it is lack of force , but because he is bit@@ tern@@ ed .

first Nations Youth you@@ ths use hip @-@ hop to express itself and preserve its own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
you@@ ths of first Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do them through hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of way@@ workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , mobile recording studios have been connected directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e @-@ communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The North@@ star .
the workshop thus increases with the fact that the young participants in talks topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever you will find in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , where the young people are the main actors .
since workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations @-@ communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ neb@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the Kit@@ sum@@ mer@@ um First Nation , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ can@@ ada , where almost two dozen mainly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video player to con@@ vey how important the preser@@ vation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences from glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people are unable to master the languages of First Nations .
in the following song the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation took up , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e .
the following adolescents received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is the verse in address , as well as translation into English , translated here into German :
sometimes I feel , no one would ever get interested in me
but I try to go on earth for my days
that is the day you will take away our scre@@ am
because we have lost our way in life ,
but I believe we will rise up one day ,
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and adv@@ ancing our youth
so , you can do this , for what she was appointed by the creator .
in the commentary , the reader and supp@@ orter of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution , adding the verse in sy@@ ll@@ s ( which is also published on his blog and re@@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( si@@ zel@@ nuts ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ y@@ u ( pen@@ dic@@ ts , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) served by every dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to making this plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small companies that produce plastic dishes , which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they do not even more stri@@ ve to them . however , a new trend turns them today in show@@ cases cell phones and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series published social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic shred@@ ded cell@@ phone bands such as they are shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ously foods have been turned into kit@@ es , such as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ d refriger@@ ators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the area of food is increasingly complex .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel dish with seafood ) has turned into a cell stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone support .
we also have made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple , who &apos;s holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the dresser .
some mobile support and cell phone designer allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon ro@@ che@@ ated , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can &apos;t beat my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise his colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest cell stand has the form of mel@@ odic ice cream .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand straps from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ill@@ ino@@ ile plastic dishes can be downloaded under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the expos@@ us@@ ement of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survi@@ vors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of all domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico the mis@@ chief and ge@@ aring regularly affect statistics in Mexico . however , this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle involves .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , head of the S@@ inal@@ oa cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victim of conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or on the communities who have learned to live with pain .
behind each body , behind every bone and in the centuries @-@ secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never heal .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Tri@@ Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug dealers , which is to give a voice and stories of people telling them in the struggle between en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to go many kilometres to buy something like that of milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ ge@@ que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly those stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that seeks secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father and her husband , her husband and her husband , only one day one day .
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we are ready to prepare ourselves for the task that we have asked to go and to graves , according to the people we have loved to seek . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he was supposed to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
right now , she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but they don &apos;t pay it out because they demand a death certificate .
where should we get this ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ a a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who fear the fear . we have to show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility , and government leaders .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post in Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter in which form it occurs :
I know disease and sensation in journ@@ alism for some years now .
I arrive every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it seems like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t have the same or normal .
she writes further :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old cousin would think that he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he &apos;s great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders , when they go through the streets .
for me , this is what they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they have something like that .
I see our weakness , when stories to block numbers in a statistic .
the in@@ action of men is unbelievable for me , when the death of six people and disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified , they have been &quot; infl@@ ated . &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade that they remain spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months collection at the main city district : how a family had been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats such as armed crime month for month money from their business until they were not only destroyed the business , but also torn their family apart .
you think everything you &apos;ve lost and remember how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
pain never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers as well .
we only contact us if it &apos;s absolutely necessary .
the more we are apart , the better .
she closed its report with words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kill you or kill you .
I was wonder@@ fully asked if I would dissolve my profound feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to weep . I must learn to live with pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the defined generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like the other boy of his age , whose parents take care of her .
Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells he himself had to teach himself how to make an egg cooked , potatoes , tortillas , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle containing water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life is from violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother is gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood lived already two years earlier , when he just saw a few blocks from his home , the bloody dead body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social issues in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone the public prosecutor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 murders per day . this equ@@ ates to 8.5 murders per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that op@@ pose the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the country &apos;s soul .
few stories live in view of a new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ un@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to represent the complex information behind the failed battle against drug dealers , who has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades , in compreh@@ en@@ sible manner .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , include pictures , on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lift up a rum@@ or or a fake .
but how is this the first time spotted ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to exist further .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it has been used to authenti@@ c@@ ate the trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this mis@@ coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - denied not the fact that there are cop@@ ious reporting on events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but ask questions about our desire for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange at the East of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
according to the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted and devast@@ ated by this . the streets in the region became dangerous varieties full of stro@@ kes , which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically on the road tan@@ ker fell victim to victims .
full@@ ness representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including one movie nearby , which was full of people who wanted to watch the football world championship .
houses dist@@ ressed and hol@@ low bodies were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it shows rows of a hol@@ low body that ins@@ ets on the ground while people look at them .
but this is not the end of her story .
over the years ago the same photo has been carried out several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but fortunately not to be attributed to the supporting trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the indigenous communities of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically by atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down , dead bodies were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a people on Human Rights Watch .
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up period was shown on the basis of satellite imag@@ ery .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the establishment point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture came out of the DR Congo , as it was fal@@ sely cited as proof of the fact and the potential scale of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
two days after Paris , a massacre of 2,000 people took place .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass redness .
another step further take your comments as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ sely explained the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange has also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who flee , ra@@ kes , rape and some dead , some through burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ sts like the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page , which was fal@@ sely declared that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an Being said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from DR Congo to clari@@ fy this information .
the original contribution , which was finally picked up on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations , who called AFP to their source , were also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ an Being that statement , but had not thus taken the image from the DR Congo .
the world &apos;s wide range of false information
tracks of this false coupling cuts up to 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; um@@ ped picture search &quot; you can see how far reaching borders can be exceeded .
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 pictures found below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo .
they origin@@ ate from a mixed leaf@@ let of private parties , platforms social media and communities as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as : English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some of them have passed wrong reports , occasionally have tried other attempts to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
we have introduced examples of the use of mis@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , on which side they had been published . as a result , we want to display the range more clearly than by the language alone .
several examples of ab@@ used use can come from the listed countries ( which in some cases linked also ) .
here are some cases that can now be completely split up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries are on pages or servers , with the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood are still available .
the countries in grey are examples which are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information about the Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed in Algeria and interested Arabs ) as a part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published a set of correc@@ tive news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , revealed a discussion among Muslims from the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 massacre and the connection to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were tent@@ atively in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was wit@@ ched as proof for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were linked with this were never taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre was put into circulation , translated discussions like this in Vietnam@@ ese , and declared it to fal@@ seh@@ ood .

in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture eventually bears a correct description , but the original piece is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( in@@ hib@@ itions ) that go through this posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photograph was used in terms of greater discussions regarding the silence in connection with the murdered Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassin@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is necessary to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give up longer faith in these images .
with social media , there are people who un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy .
suggested by this mood of the failure and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and decor@@ ates the actual horror of what is actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that it is rec@@ alled by pictures of ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and viewers are des@@ pic@@ t@@ ze and feel the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ise emp@@ athy ( such as this study that exam@@ ines such as non@@ violent media to help others ) .
while there are things to discuss non@@ violent ren@@ der@@ ings in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for current news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests anything , which is actually resolved from the context or to completely mis@@ used type .
one of the investigation of false senti@@ ment should however , however , should take into consideration how internationally they can .

the &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Simmons uses B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able ( for example , un@@ translated ) , language enth@@ used a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate .
such words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , Spanish so@@ ste@@ esa ) .
but everyone resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of an easy translation .
a word or expression is not sufficient , why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find some words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u VAT , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ented you for your parents in recognition of how you have ever stri@@ ving for yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ el language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; truck &quot; - The ease or sl@@ oth that you feel after being war@@ med in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they grin@@ d other cultures , reveal other thought sizes and raise our curiosity .
sometimes , as we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
Red@@ ner of &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are much appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite movies here .

the island nation Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .

according to a statement by the cat@@ astroph@@ ic centre of Sri Lanka , on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of floods and sl@@ um@@ ber@@ la@@ es .
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26th May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stays .
the rainf@@ alls were closed on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the waters in some places went slowly .
health and hygiene under the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood catastrophe :
high tide at Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water objects of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ant and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to high water supply .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .

this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded with the floods of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Luftwaffe re@@ signed five aircraft for rescue operations , and five of them will be completed for transportation of deliveries to the residents in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also been declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on high water supply and humanitarian aid .

the Muslims must not see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use of approved .@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girl@@ friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts her children , she is my rock in the industry .
in one minute we &apos;ll call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next step , we have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound with an American flag , other sk@@ ar@@ ches par@@ ol@@ es against Islam host@@ ility .
my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; These things are not related to you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already managed this entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who have been working for me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; that has built itself in their imagination .
they disp@@ mus@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims do not fit there , will be mus@@ cled .
det@@ ox@@ y will be shu@@ ff@@ led
I don &apos;t get alone .
this is even the poet that poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to one in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was just as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim Ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but religion is er@@ ased in the western performance , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduced images of Muslims , Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting view is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures will continue to stand up today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to ste@@ er them .
I &apos;ve worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I &apos;ve seen how this powerful , faulty s@@ cour@@ agement domin@@ ate our new@@ s@@ feeds .
this Nar@@ r@@ ativ overs@@ ha@@ dow the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential can@@ did@@ ature in 2016 .
this narr@@ ative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are being h@@ acked , their head scar@@ f in public buildings to cover and aci@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that both sides are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group practice its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong scar reson@@ ates Muslim women who lead movements to change .
it looks ahead , that the first Muslim prayers were pronounced on American ground of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , who were brought about this way with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this s@@ qui@@ eter has filled our collective pre@@ fabri@@ cation force such as deep and in@@ correct , that often Si@@ kh men and children become aimed at tim@@ us@@ sian attacks and decor@@ ations .
because of these stories , which we declare and due to the manner in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives , who help us to understand the world .
and my industry has strongly failed to capture the scar to 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise at the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
over one @-@ third of the whole Muslim population are an African @-@ ed@@ ged Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation that origin@@ ate from 77 countries .

use appro@@ ves .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American Stati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan himself thought the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were Muslims and Americans .
but I &apos;m a Muslim and American woman now ?
sometimes , if people wonder why I don &apos;t ask pork meat , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some t@@ ank@@ ers , all Muslims must bear with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa w@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ esting , we don &apos;t wear all t@@ ank@@ ers with us .
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected by almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to fight far @-@ widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with money , think tanks , and experts for the fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already f@@ law@@ ed image that is a Muslim ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of stories we declare and due to the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a stranger who runs the head cloth .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the United States , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bes in its ug@@ ly form attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so far reaching , so versatile and complex that it can fit into a drawer .

use appro@@ ves .
I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only when I was four years old when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of an pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe I would see my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , my rock in the bran@@ ce that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the Western rit@@ ual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms , and you saw the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Qur &apos;@@ s .
every one of them , I repeat three times .
I ask therefore , that they are protected from the evil one , the evil one , and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .

use appro@@ ves .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother &apos;s maternal side with her sisters ; as in decades ago , they can win a competition of the art of floral design in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their complete and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and one cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost be destroyed .
Muslim is to say the prayers that they had spoken to me when I had a bad day .
as for me , the Muslim Brotherhood , as they taught me to refer to God , Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who founded - over the centuries - by a &quot; Imperial Empire , &quot; which has founded a company dedicated to the name of a v@@ ener@@ able British East Indian company Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning of God to call my lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use appro@@ ves .
belonging means up to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time , my zu@@ cchini is weeping .
meanwhile , as he writes about the modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ asch@@ i , N@@ ana J@@ aan was ins@@ emin@@ ded about his family in the Indian family , K@@ ash@@ mir , family which he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , like my grandfather , were torn by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at stake .
Muslim &quot; means to know that , in the last two centuries , Europeans are all united to &quot; colonial countries &quot; among the last two centuries .
it means that the first fly her@@ ed@@ oms of history was being dropped before a century over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time , the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , washed away subject to the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he was the first mosque in England .
even before there were aircraft , he travelled to more parts of the world as I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed over every continent except for the Antarc@@ tica , were able to pursue mass destruction of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
a Muslim Brotherhood is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy is in the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is recorded four times more than a story of a white attacks .
it means to know that four@@ ten years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a freed black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X will call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life .
an American woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Punj@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our ab@@ normal@@ ities of all ident@@ ities , but to fail because they communicate to others .
the tri@@ pod of the 1.7 billion bir@@ dies is more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reduced rate &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
being a mother , meant to take care of my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that power@@ fully and privileged persons are er@@ ect on this two structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bes is constituted in the Muslim regi@@ stran@@ ts that began with President Bush and , under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in immigration li@@ aison officers , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that surro@@ unds its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which has largely Arab and Muslims into the visor .
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs we throw at the Muslim lands .
because of the stories we tell and due to those who we don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University showed a scientifically described picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding the evolution of evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation , which we have to lead
we are too deep to reveal Muslim &quot; Muslim &quot; or other &quot; other . &quot;
we are coming decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ts and dangerous letters that we ste@@ er in our news editor .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our varied identity and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say of Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Woo@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series beyond black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , prolifer@@ ate Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero , all this makes me hope .

coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global periods where we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion dollars .
there is a reason for that con@@ spir@@ ing the@@ or@@ ist that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , because they have made Muslims with &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , by offering the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years ago it had not yet been given ; now they have great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and the story that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is my daughter now , but those who have made me become an un@@ disputed Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
things that may perhaps wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions which makes our humanity , like a story , where someone is made to another &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than one hundred acade@@ m@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms , with which we usually throw in our schools around us , or who we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I tell it here at this T@@ ED@@ X Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who showed us how wars are led and killed by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , four decades ago became a researcher of Stan@@ ford .
we must present ourselves un@@ comfortable questions on the role of this , consci@@ ously and un@@ conscious , as it did my girl@@ friend and in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because we did not have a new future in which we had no pre@@ sidents , the chocolate cake is bombar@@ ded , while he already cap@@ tains countries and &quot; to others &quot; people , go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ative arts wants to preserve urban language diversity
for stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the licensing CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier to someone with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about an initiative by Steven Bird , the In@@ translated Blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite such little different languages are not handed over to the children born there .
for the makers of the project is :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world may be avoided , when we create cities , accept diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to include .
while &quot; listen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers make their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and representation are that the listen@@ er will indicate that .
they call laugh and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is being told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ates the opportunity to clari@@ fy the history of the narr@@ ative of the narr@@ ative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Be@@ ak of the H@@ asen and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
having explained the importance of his label , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in@@ sen he shares his sense of exclu@@ si@@ vity :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can organize with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ elling .
Puerto Rico requests from the United States to re @-@ consoli@@ date the sovereign debt
on 3 April 2017 , with the aim of a new review of the public debt of Puerto Rico , on the last 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ ory Capit@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ ori@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Code for the Neur@@ onal Assessment of the debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
we also submitted a pet@@ ition on the mutual debt of the White House of the White House on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies which are responsible for debts , for their corruption .
we call for a financial assessment and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , according to our working conditions , which re@@ mun@@ eration in favor of the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os ref@@ uses to pay a debt , which is not their own .
we will not choose between education and health .

photo from the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page by N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture that is focused in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the UK @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book cost books within three to five days , v@@ ases from the book cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ lie ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , published last year , is licensed here and licensed here , contains a number of par@@ agra@@ phs that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression .
it is an homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are linked to which this is associated .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researcher and authors who have been involved in the movements of free knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog , which is our new@@ s@@ feeds and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free P@@ asha Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted in the A@@ dra @-@ pris@@ ons directory , in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
we have since then no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title college memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
as Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us can begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer of open source and digital activist , since March 2012 , is detained in the Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra @-@ Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military institution , and transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer in N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken hold on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court in A@@ dra &apos;s cell . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was cont@@ acted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition remains unknown , but remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participated in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in it to expand access to the internet and to make knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the ladder of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes are more pro@@ ving than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here the Greek @-@ ro@@ man architectural styles of hi@@ lic traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not yet knowing that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this exp@@ editions into the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and conservation are created a time capsule created for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet shut up this project so far .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent all my life so that freedom from dre@@ aming and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name n@@ enne .
Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was in custody .
I have learned English to read , write and speak English .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other in@@ mates to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened me the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees , as they are using computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually considered one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of aud@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura worked together in the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ ed the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic English .
the book is licensed free .
book covers of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during every visit ,
that I sing in the world of ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the occupation in the moment we embrace it ,
that each of the dangers is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the crowd of prison
and I went in every detail of your voice and words .
which I carry with passion for me ,
when your eyes dar@@ ed ,
and I let another piece of my soul leave you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
in order to get all of the moments ,
and about your absence to weep and smile .
I bear witness to myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the Bass@@ el &apos;s detention , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote :
one year passes , my soul
while
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
Bass@@ els history is not unique in Syria .
since the protests against Bashar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , the Syrian network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5.000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime , were tortured or even executed .
since 2011 Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community announces the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we hope to repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : sentenced to pre@@ hen@@ ce@@ forth due to corruption .
Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption incident in which a member came back after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed .
this is where Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants , convicted of dis@@ rup@@ tions of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 euros ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from Mozambique , whose Council Executive Cam@@ b@@ aza was between 2005 and 2008 .
in 2016 , Cam@@ b@@ aza was released for a good tour and immediately called his re @-@ setting into the company , which was then on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic which endor@@ sed the application , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to its old position as the company did not complete a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ising procedure .
however , many residents do not mean the promotion .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integrated da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to establish the Director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and even a back@@ stage in relation to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we note is that the company should have become a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ming method against the conflic@@ ting .
however , the company remained silent but caused no reasonable legal steps for the application of appropriate functions .
the Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the ambi@@ ence of social media , does not re@@ jects this behavior , and considers the case as &quot; contradic@@ ted &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , he would be consultants after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had taken half of it .
he could keep speech@@ es and motiv@@ ating words , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has promised to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped harm .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
resi@@ due !
bitter Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political sciences in Brazil , says the director of any mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state because he was insul@@ ted it . I cannot believe someone has rewarded someone who has already insul@@ ted the state so much .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality and to serve the State , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead has operated themselves on the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as handy it has become a in@@ exhau@@ stible source of money and the state itself , this man has become tired , the pre@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this guy has been rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief was put into prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cut and - by the same : proph@@ et@@ ric speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is able to sell homeland for its amb@@ itions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from amb@@ itions .
an ambitious person is also criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and escaped free .
and today the company , with which he speaks of money , was again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Emer@@ gen@@ itor ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 . may 2017

Facebook blocked the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas and age @-@ like age .

according to information on Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or are generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook is focused on the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or fra@@ cture ( in bur@@ ial let@@ tering ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ orted con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word which is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as an author against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight the hate in Myanmar in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
even today , &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the Word itself is not calling automatically Hass@@ ler .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the Word , or doubts about their use , were cen@@ sored .
in addition , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same accounting sequences such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( age limit ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ca@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
one post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends on a spiritual way , if they had v@@ ented , how he could lie@@ ve his back pain as he made a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ er ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very but the context is completely different .
there are several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ es is that she will reduce hate language radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic before it extingu@@ ish all posts that are sus@@ pic@@ ion in sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write to Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post and check it out by checking the opposite words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spine ) .
the good thing is that this dirty nation@@ alists , the language of hate , will receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise your nation@@ alism .
while the promotion is a powerful signal to all , the hate language is spreading , the efficiency of these strategy can &apos;t stop long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship of stro@@ kes often have a cat and mouse game where users can simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing @-@ directed word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new gui@@ deline of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and share of content for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; promised the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of posts removed from people who have no negative inten@@ tions , or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his postal mail has been removed , which has nothing to do with Hass@@ ler :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the Post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for asking questions :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
writing such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
it seems , as if they started this without a local context or technical assistance , and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; peas cur@@ ry &quot; have banned .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they tried not to correct hard@@ wood .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit , that would give them a great turnover , it would be great .
remember@@ ing automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has su@@ cked for a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users can now write @-@ funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of Hass@@ ler to see if their posts will be taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language , but nevertheless :
used with permission .
the bur@@ ial text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see a pe@@ a cur@@ ry and see a Indian movie .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then will you cure people ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence .
among other things , an agreement in social networks should also pre@@ heat violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where the conflict between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been designed for his failure to bring out the out@@ dated Hass@@ elt to his bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
but rather , instead of scrat@@ ching the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better to read on context than code @-@ based initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end of the children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanimously decided a law to offer this practice , so that the marriage is now 18 .
prior to this change of adul@@ tery , a certain members of Muslim and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , gathered that the state must not interv@@ ene , as that was , at the age of maturity .
this happened , despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contrac@@ tual partner of the UN &apos;s rights , the min@@ ors of people under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal State &apos;s Stati@@ stical Office affir@@ med that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 .
online pet@@ iti@@ oning and social media movements that stri@@ ve to abol@@ ish laws with c@@ laws , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . no doubt , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for instance , had no concerns to say the criticism of children &apos;s criticism , they should not take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition ra@@ cked un@@ complicated cause for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated point , and eventually coinci@@ dentally , whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s toe - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would have him to the law .
now only the president of the country has to agree and proc@@ laim@@ s the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators announced a status update on Facebook which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle re@@ posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Lord Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the draft of the bill was voted for the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one of the two .
once he was elected in the Senate , the design can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws have been finally changed to the children &apos;s toe .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who used a Minister of Ministers at the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary tann@@ ins used to waste the kernel of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is almost worth every price .
while Abel in the opinion was that it took long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , outstanding news !
the marriage court has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil group , which is quite openly about how important the adoption of the law may be noted :
the married life in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft of marriage was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were in the vote .
all members who were opposed to have voted against the law .
the children &apos;s toe is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ let .
many thanks to all the activists who have cli@@ pped him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our ME@@ Ps .
however , a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma , Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
some months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to have his promise to be fulfilled .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it is quite law@@ fully when Mahar@@ aj tried to act against the law , most social media users wish to deal differently on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion as general , in a way that we can address the state into our bedroom , simply specifically that we may protect the state into our bedroom , that it may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ preserved men who are ab@@ used against them in the advantage , would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law , or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legally legally legally or continue the norm , although there are laws that they say .

with the mirror of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again .
the Wikipedia page was shown on January 18 , 2012 , with the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the USA , internationally ad@@ ver@@ ed internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has now been dis@@ closed the popular and based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle @-@ based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
every day , it &apos;s clear how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series defend against the lock .
although many technology experienced users are used to use converting tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most of the usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been issu@@ ing articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University have been held annually since the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world , when it comes to Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages containing the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform ham@@ mer@@ ed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( thus calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator ) which is not based on the system of domain names , thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ orship hard .
the content is also available in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a Blog@@ post reports IP@@ FS about its efforts :
after we heard the news ( via the lock of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to cut snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform , so the ability to de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed the contents into de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed .
this can help users to view all Wikipedia contents , even if they can &apos;t get the site www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ .org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to get around the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy , a Mir@@ ror Side of Mir@@ ror , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mir@@ ror@@ sides when the country is locked in Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a Mir@@ ror .
one can get to another URL , which is not the original . that is what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the servers lead the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself if these are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wild photographer uses his camera to take attention to the need for nature protection
there is a lying rhin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around and never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with bad positioned moti@@ fs and balanced colors .
the motivated him to carry a camera to yourself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to bring Nepal as animal world into the international stage .
and his home village just next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direc@@ ts attention to Nepal as animal world .
he described them on Facebook , as it helps him to perform this first @-@ class location in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested just at home when suddenly mist@@ aken ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was found , and I immediately started talking about pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves a collaboration with the authorities to obtain world @-@ wide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fur@@ ious how they look like .
and he should know it , for he was already ti@@ pped tig@@ ers from face to face :
a tiger lets itself do not distur@@ b by the belief of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was too , because of the darkness in the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately puts us up and hit me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared at Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ published here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
in many parts of India , there are women with greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands , or even from older males in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences should they dis@@ regard the norm , practice this practice .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convicted of the Indian state of O@@ ther@@ a by a pro@@ ver@@ ous court and ch@@ atter@@ ed by their family and the village community after she had addressed a secret relations with names .
the tradition of their wives also did not call her name , is also common among men . however , they have far less to fear or fear if at all , they shouldn &apos;t follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in Pun@@ e , on Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health staff and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became quickly became the main chat theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to discuss and discuss the qualities of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al campaign , operated by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and relies on for the breakdown of Patri@@ arch@@ ate &apos;s Patri@@ arch@@ ate community .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ige has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s position up to the ban of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and manages this club .
it reports how this club was created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made Bot@@ tom of the wall@@ ets at the same time .
the first video , which showed Roh@@ ini in their discussion round , did not know women who did not call her husbands at the name .
it has opted for this issue , because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem allowing women to easily identify themselves .
the names of their husbands did not speak according to pron@@ ounce , is a custom which they hold on all obligations and never questioned in question .
Roh@@ ini thinks :
this tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wishes for a long life .
a woman who does not hold this will be regarded as un@@ c@@ un@@ ning , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we never have made our discussion about this discussion then .
at the beginning I wanted to have Roh@@ ini who had never called her husband to the name , at home , to try out how it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at an end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me about and said that I should name him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage Roh@@ ini started their first discussion lu@@ b .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; yet . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected from all girls and women .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini requested each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us what they like , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of her husband on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ige from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ast@@ ra over the Bre@@ chen of a century @-@ old tradition in which married women who never married the name of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini told :
one woman was so shy that , during all the exercise , she was only afraid of him ; another chose to leave the full fru@@ stration against him and his family by taking him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ rush above , with an ancient fires broke out , the women decided that they would actually be able to make their husbands at home .
and they counted their word .
in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini to and asked what ideas they put the women in his head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ mother moved her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
the husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation was made in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as traction of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point at the fore@@ head , which shows the sp@@ status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the cin@@ ating red point if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it to wear him .
the other women have stopped working completely , but mean that they are now in a better position to choose , not to carry him on some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Pap@@ b is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we make a trip in every discussion lu@@ sion .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
I don &apos;t want to make sure the women make sure what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the past months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes , they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things about which they had never imag@@ ined before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working for so many years for such problems and yet I have also talked about some things , for example , as our ident@@ ities were knot@@ ted , never so hon@@ estly .
it feels great to say that certain things can be said , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is that okay , but some wanted to have a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a pants , wear ; they did not dar@@ nel .
after much contro@@ versy and discussion on the advantages of their own wardrobe , the mor@@ ality is associated with sar@@ is and much more , decor@@ ate Roh@@ ini their own pair of c@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could bear them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion lu@@ b has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slow to rolling :
we have done only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women carry now at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in discussion lu@@ bs know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like the line of more freedom of movement or the own wardrobe , at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club is everyone of us confidence that something will change .
and I know there will not only be limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which probably recently has been made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has moved attention to international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he has been hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the hospital .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( stat@@ ute ) , after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has declared Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a speaker told it as &quot; not needed to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
yet China continued to claim calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , to allow for a treatment abroad .
while some countries have crit@@ ici@@ zed the strict management of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are wi@@ thered away .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
hands R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met in late June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
a spokesperson , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Liu abroad a treatment .
Norway , Norway and Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ent have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway got into the impact after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government had ha@@ sten@@ ed that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon tours to China , as exports since 2010 were mostly blocked .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release , and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo .
thanks to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the European Union , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she ha@@ sten@@ ed in a statement on 30 June :
we at the same time , China expects all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they are to meet and receive all visits , they wish , and able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad shared with the fact that Americans thought &quot; him that he has the opportunity to treat the treatment abroad , unless it was to help him with his gen@@ ius . &quot;
a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message left the Chinese authorities not to release Liu , but also to free Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the claim of the US embassy moved from China to itself , with the outside of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to interv@@ ene and an ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as travel accessibility and access to medical care of its choice in which they are entitled to a Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to pushing the Chinese government to eliminate Liu and his wife condition@@ ally .
I demand China to release the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he would be in@@ correct medical treatment in proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
in July 3 , Berlin , the German government of Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu &quot; receives all the medical support which he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president X@@ i Jin@@ ping was issued on 7 @-@ 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency that China had great concerns , whether the Wir@@ bel could ha@@ dow its visit to Hamburg .
Canada , Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um , called for China to provide reasonable medical care and provide the opportunity to provide himself with his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told him that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not permitted to speak with someone else , including his lawyers , and contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada called for China to commit its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to preserve and dis@@ closed the rights of these rights .
France , France
France &apos;s Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family are to have contact with him .
although the broadcast France Info announced that the French government would welcome Liu in the Land , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France would eventually receive him .
Taiwan
the Council of land@@ land@@ affairs in Taiwan called China on June 27 to release Liu &apos;s release and for a larger tolerance towards those who demand peaceful funding to demand political reform and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Labor Party in China also called for the sick of intellectual Liu to treat Himself in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself in a statement on 28 June by Liu very concerned and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been punished for a harmon@@ ious , more stable , and weal@@ thy China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally very moving and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens insp@@ ires by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , liberty and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

Singapore is a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore .
but according to the Justice Minister , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore was to consider as a town .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the State Association of New York State Association , the Minister informed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party in Singapore , as compared with other countries in Singapore .
it supported that Singapore should be considered as a town .
... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , the most people go wrong .
I have tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifice , this valuable country is to be created , one can say that we ultimately will not be a land .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had an attempt to escape in the responsibilities , a must off@@ end .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore in other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which , he appeared un@@ objec@@ tively un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike cities that are led permanently from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itative mach@@ ites appears again to be prec@@ eded by the democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the final week , the answers from Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am was given answers to its American guests in regard to our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system really not answers .
appropriate issues can be clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers r@@ ational kind .
Rachel Z@@ eng demands Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country is our city ...
short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our advertising K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would go on the trouble to clari@@ fy this point if he paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing on the blog , he points out on the critics that one should start to read the entire co@@ dex from the conference , so that we could understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &apos;s statements better , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the script .
as he said , Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ acceptable , even if we are looking for free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
when he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore has said , very embar@@ r@@ assed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that awaits me - was I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he believes this really , right , and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review zer@@ es the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der &apos;s speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , there is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the Inter@@ governmental Conference , the statements made by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but only defend their city , but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink human identity ?
are we citizens of a country or the residents of a city ?
in fact , the Journey of a Dec@@ ade ten@@ ds to affir@@ mation , Singapore is and always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have off@@ ended many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear papers like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right .
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect at your home country or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , being exposed to rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ is Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most obvious to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; I am from Canada . since 1994 I live and again in Japan .
depending on the situation in which situation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his talk partner by providing personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication , then the default answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in mind when they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t hurt me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans have a Canadian flag right at their back@@ pack when they arrive .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans ... .
so it was , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons in us !
gay marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005 now !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
obviously we are obviously very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country in other ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
firstly , I have many American friends who I ad@@ mi@@ red very much .
there would be nothing to me , if one would switch me using Johnny from Dallas , for example .
Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly : when &quot; nice &quot; is called &quot; nice &quot; in essence , be sp@@ lic@@ ating - as such a good , gentle , but trag@@ ically , very significant figure , N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian double star ) .
if Canada really would have a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would actually be a step forward . but the actual problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can stum@@ ble .
be harmless , being in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and in@@ interesting to earn and make no attention .
that can be something good when you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , re@@ mot@@ ely from the things that pass around .
I would even come as far as to say that the desire to be free and only to be one of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what the existent as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans often don &apos;t talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we are missing the warm heart@@ ed , open friendliness , which I connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada sin@@ c@@ ably sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ ody by Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has published a music video which took power to the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite their promises to restore civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band tat@@ too describes a young man who tells of what his girl@@ friend does .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet uses for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
during the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook has been shared 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists stri@@ pped the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy , especially as it stands with the situation in the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand will have pursued in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 Rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , with the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the He@@ eres absolute decision making up important national topics .
11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of the &quot; deployment of journalists &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered to be a critic of the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law relating to computer crimin@@ ality , its v@@ age and un@@ clear provisions often used by the authorities to re@@ lie@@ ve activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , monitored by online content and persons who were accused of having s@@ lan@@ dered the monarchy , was prosec@@ uted .
Thailand is a strict conclusion against &quot; Maj@@ estic Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ estic reading ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the mar@@ tial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts warned them that the purchase should be un@@ necessarily , and an wast@@ age of tax ev@@ asion .
in the video , it &apos;s even shown how people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans before they bring it into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison , because they have allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and threat@@ ens Internet use long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band that had previously used the sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; that was already used by coup opponents during protests in 2014 .
life continues to ruins of the viol@@ ins in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post@@ war company re@@ covers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
there are now over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ ian War was officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , depreciation , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called viol@@ as towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today , there are only a few hundred people in these v@@ ulture cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ her@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16.000 people had barely increased after it had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five floor blocks from the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ and@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I speak ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which serve all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived at this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile .
about fifty inhabitants live in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ que , which still houses one or two families , is recognis@@ able on the balconies where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look from the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me in their hands , they withdraw it immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers on her girl@@ friend and suddenly leaving her destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
in winter , the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman passed away with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is named in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off abor@@ tion Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Central Asia , &quot; she tells her .
Gal@@ ina wants no financial help by her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither have a vegetable garden a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; gives it .
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells her that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is concerned with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; she calls her husband G@@ alya &apos;s her . &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes .
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ asha lived together with her husband and the five common children living in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day they rec@@ alls the village live before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia only broke off ) , they didn &apos;t have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we have recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but that will last a little , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha is receiving approximately $ 9 children for each child .
her husband works in the coal pit .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once found , they hold pigs , cows , h@@ eh@@ ne and chickens .
it tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but during the period she lost their fears .

&quot; we have no fear in front of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was little work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day that the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy l@@ acks us over us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy sc@@ ram@@ bled him .
he plays with the ball , which instruc@@ ts the hill .
a group of children now pursue the ball .
while they run , some of them throw rocks to the falling building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for imm@@ or@@ ality in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses the migrants in their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ anlage , the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org . it appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is managed by a 59@@ th year old Mexican , a small woman with a coral pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in the ted@@ dy bears form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are in transit .
the hotel has rather not a charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare clothes , removable walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants have come here .
sometimes Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , tells people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you m@@ um Africa ? &quot;
currently it is rather quiet , but in this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on board boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she helps them and bring them to the hospital when she is sick , she buys them medications which they can not pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhau@@ sti@@ ve them out of the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cks .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women .
very aff@@ ection@@ ately .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to re@@ locate her husband and his three children .
they already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , to make regular one first stop in South America and then go toward the north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans were often travelling together the circuit and that the Afri@@ cans speak on What@@ s@@ App of Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his responsibilities , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil , and worked as construction workers on building sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months : he sells the cards to save the necessary money to purchase the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he &apos;s answers to us . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us that their guests send their often text messages when they are continued to gr@@ ate them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez may be very popular here , but it is not the only hope for migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
on the other end of the city , a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family received migrants in their little house .
it is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ ch@@ ets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on ceilings along the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his workplace .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ anlage comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to press money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for a lodging and an unknown , an all @-@ pet@@ ual , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family lives still here and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the gears , passengers are quietly able to consult their phones .
a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , much of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ ma she leaves her album with numerous pictures .
there are one of her daughter with African hair stain@@ s that you made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and elderly .
she laughs sad@@ ly , while she briefly asks her .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; it is repeated every time . &quot; they have gone before . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
check @-@ Point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ Us@@ ers .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , ethnic minority groups in the west of China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 , mobile phone users received a mobile notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile notification where the district government shows a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
in the communication , it is said that the App is aimed to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot;
but the authorities emp@@ tied the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app after having installed the app messages with a private chat group .
in the police report it says that the app would determine and follow the terrorists &apos; sources and follow the terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive , how much time they spend online and to control the own home network .
these app with the filters for min@@ ors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can , of course , be used in various ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could manipul@@ ate public players or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures relating to control of digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications relating to digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme z@@ ens@@ ors and security measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet shut@@ downs .
on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( si@@ zel@@ nuts ) , a cen@@ sored news in China , photos of a check@@ point where the residents drew in@@ discrimin@@ ately , whether they were installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have comp@@ elled the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( brochures ) published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift up the key specifications of a Windows operating system and thus maintains un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the town council , to minim@@ ize spreading illegal contents .
all government agencies , authorities and the party connected institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of your computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree against all residents and entrepreneurs , up to 1 August , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; which viol@@ ates the right rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s rights of three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible inter@@ rup@@ tions , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death

this is the first of six reports in a series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look down and make sure you are all alone at a place where everything l@@ ately disappeared .
everything has been dissolved after and after dis@@ band@@ ed and a truth reveals clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one who makes their name all honor .
one that struck down in a list of feelings and expressions , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality is back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the perform@@ ers - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubt loose in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is going on on the axis of the monster , you know that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone were erected .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to be &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of security intelligence has form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he set his power over us , by destro@@ ying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were killed during a peaceful protests like the we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our Revolution .
it was enough to cut the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the quarters were cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands to a city that is stri@@ pped to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ce .
in the third night the things felt a bit worried after the power supply in the neighborhood had to work .
I broke through the st@@ illness , by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my home roof .
I heard my voice through the st@@ illness .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to cooperate .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we moved to a splendid picture that fully filled my expectations .
in such a moment , you are aware that you delivered the spirit out of the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the least .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to your voice , after you put them all the way up to the office of security from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk to : &quot; let me listen to what you are &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his h@@ ash filled eyes drew on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did , did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ishness , per@@ it@@ el@@ ty , perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure as I answered : &quot; I would not have thought that I had already forgotten my voice in yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to look in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I have said .
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father at the same time . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with this . &quot;
the smell of this cursed sat@@ in lies me up in the nose today .
he was sentenced to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a psychological torture which I was suspended for months .
I cry the yard .
in the first office I let everything go back with me .
then again by the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I preferred all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise , they probably never shared a larger cell in this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoner , and may not sit down immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I grab@@ bed his way to the proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my com@@ rade was an &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ain@@ ee . &quot;
after long hes@@ it@@ ments he gave me ultimately .
apparently in any of the surrounding cells there was a prestigious middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness itself can be seen in me no distinctive facial features , and doctors are not available here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers inter@@ fere with its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ ped me , they would leave him free if I stay .
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , in order to distribute all these crow@@ s , which l@@ acks the fruit in my head of my head .
from the distance , I still listened to &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; out of the distance .
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around the time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of per@@ dition was , until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; recording on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
with this , the secret had been ventil@@ ated : to protect the state of State and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ we@@ ath@@ ic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational re@@ pres@@ et card and ri@@ pped the close perspective of their world view .
this is no house here , that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ ential to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I ask the hearing room and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least it comes to me so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that withdraw to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin to join this day and to protest on demonstrations , which will soon come to an end anyway . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I &apos;m acc@@ ust@@ omed to answer , not to answer .
I can really say that when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication tool .
when and how this happened was in@@ significant .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to be punished , though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
at the punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to pl@@ uck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; confession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker has bl@@ ushed on your cri@@ es .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot return your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams did not bowed down to him , so that they cast off the tube through a cable .
in my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collection , or whether this was one of the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present ourselves , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in the series .
I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice , why I listened to scre@@ am .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , so it was a next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my bi@@ cker body , which lay stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two dre@@ ad@@ ful hours , he decided that he had satisfied his duty for that night .
it must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to lie down again . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed by , who came to me like minutes .
then the call to the dawn .
the door open and the morning light is fulfilled the room &quot; .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
I reply with the voice of a tired young people : &quot; my lord , my father must make himself fear@@ ful concerns . &quot;
&quot; be silent and quiet , you will be transferred . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free opinion of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smoke a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib spend the most of his time inside ; once he sl@@ ashed out to his screen , sometimes at his computer , and again to the couch .
but what one can depend on , is a cigarette between his fingers , or with nic@@ ot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ ib has been a passionate activist , who was transferred to the conservative majority , and their alt@@ re@@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music that is often dealt with topics like orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , it is also demanding the core of the whole Arab world . all these topics do not only find relevance in their hom@@ etown of Amman , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of San@@ aa in Yemen .
with 25 years of age , H@@ da@@ ib sees himself as someone who has not been restricted in his thinking , and he can ass@@ ure the consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it , he swe@@ eps out a special removal against US American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ ib looked at his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ ib doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in conflict areas , with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugee &apos;s second generation &quot; - so he describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life circumstances so &quot; st@@ resses h@@ da@@ ib .
then he adds : &quot; I think , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while he sol@@ dered the nest @-@ cafÃ© in two m@@ ug@@ s . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in that time it is fore@@ seen for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption is illegal by food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ da@@ ib has given a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ lick are warm coffee and the wa@@ xes of K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under free sk@@ ies , especially when you th@@ rows a view into the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it avo@@ ids easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to be unable to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has canc@@ eled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , for the second time .
some of the parliamentary sub@@ stitution that support the Islamic Emirate &apos;s Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that the sexual orientation of the country is contradic@@ ted in the country of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and the main reason for the concert table .
the Euro MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; was cancelled &quot; due to sexual orientation of the sword .
many argu@@ ed that the involvement of the volume in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , who authorized the official legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually an evident @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality reflected in Jordan which is clearly reflected in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib repeated traditional sex sounds to body by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had vo@@ re@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an evi@@ dently unknown woman , whose arms and legs will stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women , who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; Out@@ mor@@ row &apos; has risen in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch Group , according to its peak , reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still missing in order to support women , victims , victims , or domestic violence .
according to a law for inter@@ ruption in 1954 , women who are subjected to the danger of a family of family are exposed to un@@ specified time in prison , &quot; and for her release , often a year of bureaucr@@ atic expend@@ itu@@ res and the guarantee by the family is necessary that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to rep@@ orters from the themes in its land as tab@@ u .
H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies his work is political , however , dream of having his music , which is full of explic@@ it references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
as a result , politics was in@@ timi@@ dated , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed , H@@ da@@ ib took the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically politically , lets himself continue .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
in the further course of the songs H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can get into His words , &quot; That is what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gene@@ ity , or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still in 2014 were cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib took an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn from the context , and has been cen@@ sored in his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but only one processed version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ ib is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance of homosexu@@ als not dis@@ agree to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ s , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ ib is wonder@@ ing : if Abu Nu@@ s , who would like to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , in the eighth century , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do not ?
the actual problem , such as H@@ da@@ ib , didn &apos;t have anything to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the Swiss @-@ Sem@@ itic kingdom there is nothing new that the government has sanctions against the free opinion of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence .
even recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service accepted several ex @-@ government officials and members of the teachers &apos; grounds that said they were expressed in the issues related to the issues faced with the deeply ro@@ oted corruption in the country .
in view of what is the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to deal with structural changes in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is an independent casting and take out . Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is made of slow , reas@@ oned and inner changes . it is certain that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ ib were dre@@ aming , like millions of other Arabs , also from a Arab world without interventions .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region will be inspired by music , art and literature of a true and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not through bombs , spreading and arti@@ stes @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes this .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ ib is step@@ ping down and also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival that is usually celebrated in many areas in August . another theory states that the cars , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years , were invaded in the North east of Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a super view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a shared centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for a look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fe@@ ats are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care were so important as in this history , because they are helping to maintain per@@ u@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair of the hair@@ style .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street smoking and illegal drug dealers are all daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of this region &apos;s population will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services to men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to give up the more normal citizen into the experienced hands of hair@@ dress@@ ers who can re@@ build these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles .
the exceptional demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the outer edge of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the competition of hair@@ dress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts join each other to demonstrate who can create the ex@@ centr@@ ist L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who finds himself in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to exchange young people to share their weapons against hair@@ dress@@ ers and instead of bad advice a training in hair art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion .
the school was offered special training workshops prior to the beginning of March , and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only medical school in the community and the district where we are very proud because of the love of the children we have constructed this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the processed version of the &quot; love messages of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published in context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not much more important , people who feel well @-@ picked up , aff@@ ection to your aff@@ ection ?
this question was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os out of the Young Youth Foundation no longer and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconc@@ ile ) , the young people to encourage gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ or@@ la@@ ir F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) which forms the slaughter point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered as important to mark the signing of the peace agreement as the so important that Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of Colombia , there is a long way until one can talk of a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa absor@@ bers , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a rh@@ et@@ rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock its weapons contributed to themselves , to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , that had used to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hate against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now support them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ n@@ arians joined together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the campaign &apos;s objective are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - which will then be handed in personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian took the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people who love to write on the Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those forget who need much more .
he was going to plan , and he continued to share his love with people this year , which needed the most urgent need .
thus , the plan was created , letters full of hope and support for former fighter of the F@@ ARC , which now will have their place in society and create a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a history of war to a common history of peace . &quot;
until now , more than 2,000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would be forgiven me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19th March .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the town council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art re@@ ists to the camp to personally deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC beha@@ ved so much as they did earlier in order to accept the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub@@ sid@@ y from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different emotions you can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , &quot; told the political knowledge of Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a assistant of the Govern@@ ors of the Valle del Cau@@ ca Province described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter brought me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters are living ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
and I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he said , &quot; I reply to a letter which someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I reply . &quot; I suddenly caught my tears on the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him utterly , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , so I was sorry , all the years of the faithful companions of this struggle , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was not expected to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake .
but now I know there is a society out there , waiting with open arms on us .
until now , I have learned what to handle with weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new votes
for the pre@@ lu@@ de , students and a few leaders of the F@@ ARC together came together .
the students were all grown up already as a war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we experienced the possibility of developing the social in@@ justice by the State for the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making the company in this country .
it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people who have never heard heard and had no electoral law , and to recognize that the people I had often seen as a monster , and even hate people with beautiful feelings , which were turned through their life circumstances and their environment was painful for me .
the reality , in which the country lives , hurt me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have done and caused much damage to give us a bit and give a sm@@ iles and a hug .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ n@@ ai@@ ds were prophesied that after the dis@@ armament of peace would rule peace .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment possibilities , there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
at the F@@ ARC we now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ide@@ ology belong - to all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . among those who defend the lives as foundation of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homos@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Caucas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
terr@@ ors have experienced activists of the last months beyond persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ man over the dor@@ ff LGB@@ T@@ Q assembly is not only about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a tran@@ ss@@ exual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us what is happening in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines before several months after reports were published , causing torture and killing qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took susp@@ ect que@@ ens and a@@ woke them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they were grown , her mind became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safer place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced by the gender equality of their country wife , the hunting was opened in Sabrina .
for fear of her life , she moved to the United States last entry .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
this was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ woman who st@@ aked in difficulties .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone made some of my documents , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture from me . &quot; then there aren &apos;t men to eliminate any more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the turn on What@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was right there was a few shopping bag from the seat of my car , I heard a male singer saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
then I heard another sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honour the family , you regret ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know the person .
I only know there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up last du@@ ck in the hospital .
apparently , some women had taken everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two papers in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances were you laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor got up and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him , that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I got threats of threats last February .
they called me , and wrote to me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some are completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the slow@@ ed , to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie .
they created absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it that I run up without through the streets ; others wanted I had not changed in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have bas@@ kets of grain size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the entire republic .
we can &apos;t touch you because you &apos;re a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she placed a rope around his neck .
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car was covered with dark@@ ened window wheels and a license plate with a 95 .
after it came to the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends checked the numer@@ m@@ ern@@ es - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ realistic .
I can still understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without paying me without identity , without identity .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived at and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a foreig@@ ner .
I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you won &apos;t believe you , you were in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you st@@ ems . you even know your bra@@ dy number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
in fact , it really was my grief .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the sexes , however , that is a tab@@ ular theme .
some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements I still bear in me .
as much as I wish it , this se@@ atic barrier cannot overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I give myself a trouble to look like the person who reminds them from their past - so on my male form .
but it is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed d@@ ort@@ on ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
in the process , I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who was eating one and a half months in gun .
he told that while Ram@@ ad@@ an was not arrested and tortured in Ram@@ ad@@ an , but also that all could hardly wait until the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an , and he did not shut a new wave .
most likely , they will now focus on family and relatives .
thus , I mean , they probably invite their relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; received through blood .
OC Media : do men still survive in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives , or those who were left from their relatives , to present the Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they might be able to present them later than terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base .
you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were di@@ pped to radic@@ alise in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for a one and a half months .
he says that many people have gone in prison , after their be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new from them since then .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was involved , when these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there were no reports . however , we susp@@ ect such actions are possible .
why else could it not allow these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore a hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in a Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I had never had any problems .
seriously ! in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was supposed , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
Russia tried to bring us originally to the &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lization &quot; but ultimately rejected us in the stone time .
OC Media : what is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted , I had coloured eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has never faced me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phr@@ ase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ are not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children , if they are funny about sick people .
OC Media : so they just shut up her eyes before you because they believed , you were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten me .
OC Media : how long did these gifts start ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row came into the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on mor@@ als on mor@@ als .
he spoke not about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people were beginning in the city to change .
he who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m working as a wa@@ iter .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I was still working as a activist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I joined them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , summar@@ ies , I understand her to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny a cent .
I discovered these people themselves , being sha@@ ken along the variety .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ ign .
so the nature , that has pure nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same like Ch@@ ech@@ ens who would make you know with foam in front of the mouth that there are no sw@@ ings in them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ ar@@ din@@ ers who have Russians also ; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is so un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims who go to the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live with men .
know many think about Tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ sion .
these are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be exact , different habit@@ ats .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;ll be so personally so personally , but my last time relationship is now last longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong increase of suicide since the past few months .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the suicide of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ azi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ el@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression and he sh@@ utt@@ led himself for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to come up for his family , Ah@@ mad@@ azi human rights groups who are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
on YouTube , a video shared the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people made it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ger hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors couldn &apos;t do anything more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ azi minority , and activists warned against it that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - H@@ amid Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ver Tam@@ er , have been hanged on this month .
their stories have a matter in common : they were all family members , who were able to feed on their families by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess , and unable to pursue their families .
Arab Ah@@ mad@@ azi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is based , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes the native Arab population hard to deny their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
before a century , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and took power in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran , the oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most sophisticated and valuable agricultural areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy still develops only slowly , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and alien@@ ation .
the Iranian regime refused to systematically dis@@ miss Ah@@ w@@ azi Arab@@ ians to work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large variety of twi@@ light , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and gh@@ om are lying .
these strains have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region , and the local agriculture , as well as the local and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian adolescents has now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , completed the primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad@@ azi activist leader with residence in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; by the young Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ men .
Ken@@ ji Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become even worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since Func@@ tional and Institu@@ tions do not pre@@ fers Arabic labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi calls access to work opportunities in all sectors .
that is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside of their home Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their sur@@ name and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ mad@@ azi , as even the Arab names will not be toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speech of Arab language or the wearing of Arab dress .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ azi must stand , the human rights activist alarm before the situation will explo@@ sively .
it remains to wait if the world aw@@ akes and knowledge of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ici@@ able is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I do not uni@@ fy myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ist &quot;
detail of a photos . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions emerged .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react , especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they were wonder@@ ing why I am not part of the movement .
they even thought well , scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist , and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men .
that women are still standing under strict observation , when it comes to what they may make with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later stum@@ ble in various fields of life to a gl@@ ac@@ ne veil , and that discrimination are still moving across through the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is conscious and familiar .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I &apos;m talking to skin color , rac@@ ism , black C@@ is @-@ women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I choose whom we have already been mis@@ sive , se@@ lic@@ ally and verb@@ al women , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to raise &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , to reach the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is a institutional form of rac@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or above that black women and women other eth@@ nic@@ ities and origin of origin less earn as white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ her@@ es and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women .
on the other hand , I want all the women to have all the men and not all men any skin color ; on the other hand , I can not connect to a black woman to consider the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider ine@@ quities in their thinking that relate to both the gender as well as to the skin color of one person .
I &apos;m exhausted and will no longer struggle to fight my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always denied me and countless other black women and always rejected .
1851 . in her speech , 1851 said in her speech : &quot; am I not a wife ? &quot; and I also myself refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is an un@@ ic@@ uous and mar@@ g@@ inal nature .
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , which can also be found in order to drive their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
I will not try to change white women the importance of the over@@ taking of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to dis@@ close the significance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to revi@@ ve them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women in different income and boundaries between white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to dissolve me completely and completely from femin@@ ism and set me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman , instead of me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly , that interfer@@ ter@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever , that we will define black women in our own ideas and give us into the sp@@ her@@ es that are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : recall O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism ) saying that we can defend ourselves on our own way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call policies and exclusion , after having read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can emp@@ t black women and women other cultures because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognised as part of my dark skin and as part of my life as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life has neither cur@@ ated , nor ignored , nor rejected .

Paraguay women and her difficult fight against violence
a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; The crying women &quot; to express their pain across the women &apos;s mor@@ ons in the country and in the region to show its re@@ jection .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by c@@ tur@@ ally . this article is part of the # Por@@ Ser@@ m@@ j@@ er ( # Ref@@ lich@@ en@@ ef@@ rau@@ am ) , which reports about the Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of affected people .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner who had become violent over violent crime .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would not be laid , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , the respon@@ sive display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not use anything .
a few days later , the second woman retired her ad@@ vert .
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women should refund ever , they do not receive any support from the stadium in general .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who have to admit victims of violence themselves at all in law en@@ forcement authorities .
content 1 hits and statistical analysis and a legal system that do nothing of any under@@ mining 3 of the laws : good approach , defective contro@@ versy , and statistics
it is difficult to see how many women are really har@@ assed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a research scientist at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are several data and reports which , however , do not once appear to the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the figures below are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District Office of the Prosecutor dropped 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went around violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police arrived from women .
more than 5000 displays because of domestic violence among the peace @-@ judicial power . here , 86 % of the read@@ ings of women came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true depth of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s minist@@ erial minister , only few of these off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women will not do this .
for every woman ref@@ unded because of physical failure , two women come , who do not do this , &quot; she explained in late 2014 .
as the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ences , law en@@ forcement agencies can not be adequ@@ ately documented , how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
up to August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible ab@@ uses and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all their former friends .
in the beginning they didn &apos;t want to do that , but then , however , they should repent .
today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer deal with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the dead@@ liest :
I have never thought of being victim to mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it earlier , I thought that only women seem to be sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they seem to be fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the ab@@ uses by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people answered her contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric if he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users questioned Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen that so long from Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least some inno@@ c@@ ence .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had abuse them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( I believe you ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as , everything started with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as ads were in the authorities without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against her former partner who developed an in@@ consistent legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland , where it was mainly concerned with money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , lacking implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applicable .
the ad of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , sees major problems with the use of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill of bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) is part of a campaign that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law is able to explain Fem@@ iz@@ d to a stand @-@ standing trial and pun@@ ish the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature was altered in some points to also win the MPs to the Law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions that currently banned in Paraguay is basically banned and sentenced to five years &quot; imprisonment .
the original bill was fore@@ seen , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) of the process that need to bear the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to refund and receive a safe accommodations , to state the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective when the legisl@@ ature cannot provide sufficient financial resources .
in Paraguay , abuse are seen as part inter@@ human relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place , violence is not taken more than anything normal .
whoever remains silent in the face of these facts , is inde@@ b@@ ted and bearing the perpet@@ r@@ ator of the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
we must restore so long ad@@ re@@ ments to ab@@ uses no more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , one passage was kn@@ itted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes are apart .
the debate on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ressor , to attack his victims .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as great set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and working version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by c@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christmas in@@ ef@@ smoking ) that reports about the Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay .

independent Media in Oman a year under the prohibition of a newspaper continue to b@@ ade assault
&quot; this website has been closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information , &quot; is on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the om@@ ani authorities closed an independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before the court but later returned .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Sa@@ Ã¯@@ d , who came to power after he had left his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , who had prevailed over the country .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Chief of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , particularly civil liberties , including freedom of freedom , and human rights , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and further activists on tortured , in@@ timi@@ date and imprisoned .
the authorities emphas@@ ized peac@@ efully and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , even activists , about their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online as well as offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 over corruption in Oman ( a absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ High Parties to the Justice of Justice . &quot; it was about corruption in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , was charged to the special department and arrested at his arrival by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS Deputy Chief Editor in the You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had been chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed at an in@@ definite period after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , will be prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the court in Mas@@ cat took place the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to jail and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both found among others because of the disorder of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the State of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and the s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three @-@ year prison terms and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . furthermore , a one @-@ year ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of &quot; an information gri@@ ds for the distribution of material which could be a risk for public order &quot; was found guilty .
on 22 August 2016 , Al @-@ Abr@@ i &apos;s deposit was set up on 22 August 2016 and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i &apos;s appeal hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the prison of his six @-@ month jail sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues in prison , where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appeals Court also emphas@@ ised the decision of the Ministry of Culture to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus issued a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court , announced the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases where freedom of press was injured in Oman at the youngest time .
for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , will include their operation .
due to the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression of the om@@ ani authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1. You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2 . a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country , and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights and journalists in Oman had imp@@ eded their righ@@ t@@ ful human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including geri@@ at@@ orial shots .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit organization and non @-@ governmental organization that support human rights activists ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf area and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and safegu@@ arding them peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his agreement
medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area , one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for example , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have more gra@@ ven effects in the poo@@ rest countries of Africa than anywhere else , and lack investment to research these illnesses caused by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research that is carried out by African scientists itself will help establish its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be instrumental in the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for Expl@@ oration of Inf@@ ection Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself for@@ ged himself to the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Zam@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private owner ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the emphasis on my work is on the application of research results . I support the Zam@@ bian National Program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just launch a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific themes in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always keep the recipient instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to utili@@ ze it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs lots of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and Internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special scientific training , starting at every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of the world , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries , based on your experiences ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the default approach to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the United States to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been working on the salad for the United States since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA @-@ ast@@ ron@@ aut in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only placed by his own accident and the question , how many types of salads can get there limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more salads was patented and that he could not continue to be used for bre@@ eder .
the patents are not only suitable for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereals , or cartridges . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security concerns the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still hides his salad , however , he now needs longer , because his work is still growing steadily .
&quot; it is as if a rock should lie in a river , in order to p@@ addle me .
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents are going to go far too far .
and if they stand before a court , no one can breed more of a new Sal@@ ad variety , because all features are already patented . &quot; he is doing so good as possible and tried to breed those features that he wants .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ avo@@ red to use any material which is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is always greater in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; bre@@ eders ) .
ast@@ ron@@ aut of the international space station ISS have bred red redness of the variety of red@@ red@@ na in the &quot; greenhouse . &quot; the station is cultivated and eaten . there it is tested if plants can be grown into space .

it is not a coincidence that this name sounds like that , as the motion would come from the IT sector and not from the plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to inspire the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was set up in life to ensure that some plant species and gene must not be protected as intellectual property and are used for plant bre@@ eders permanently .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eder can under@@ go that others can freely use seed crops .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to breed it to breeding so own varieties , and not immediately out@@ going out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant designs .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
in the emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger connections , such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter , or only little by making seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg insi@@ sts that the &quot; open source &quot; movement can &apos;t work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not to buy from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who is a good , locally and sustainable product development , as it is offered on farms in August and September 2016 should also know that the way of growing crops such as this vegetables is being far@@ med .
dietary sovereign &apos;s sovereign debt without seed sovereign debt is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to provide others to keep seed maintenance free of charge . in contrast , your pre@@ ference is to patented seeds and plant features .

O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Supp@@ orters argue that the future of food supplies are at risk , since the natural pool is available , due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights to plant materials that is therefore always restricted , ru@@ rupt@@ edly shr@@ ink .
Claire Lu@@ by , the Director of O@@ ss@@ i , worked in her doctoral thesis with the genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ els features as intellectual property is protected , so it is not even usable for plant bre@@ eders either .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet , but experts , like Lu@@ by , are susp@@ ici@@ ously patented plants such as wheat in even higher style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants become so rare that they may have targeted characteristics - from such that their tastes or their colour improves up to such because , due to them in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents in plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is increasing by more patents . however , genetic diversity is now more necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gender banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural department of the United States , the company set up the preser@@ vation of genetic diversity .
she contradic@@ ts that intellectual property restric@@ ts other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is expired .
often , these instructions help others to get the same result as the same result .
such protection does not in@@ hib@@ its innovation , but it encour@@ ages how to make public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees what is different : 20 years for waiting until a patent may be done , certainly does not favor@@ ably any innovations .
and if we have to wait for such a long time to breed in plants , which are adapted to the environmental conditions , one would have already lost the struggle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general well and still should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incenti@@ ves are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
that is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ on with the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics .
the plants , they form themselves , and as bre@@ eders , ultimately , have no idea how plants do this .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who em@@ powers a variety , also interpre@@ ters its own values in them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are required for their growing her@@ b@@ icides , bre@@ aching in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is precisely overwhel@@ med . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized businesses ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , it is the most smaller seed companies , even without having to survive - either they reject this patented or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
in his breeding garden , the independent plant builder Frank Mort@@ on looks like salads .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders through avoiding plant patented innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented .
I always need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years ahead of competition , with which in my opinion it makes quite nice easy . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept spread rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) is characterised by itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources that collabor@@ ates in the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties , which satisfy certain requirements .
it also supports her to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed @-@ seeds and to sell its own .
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l operates at an open source &apos; licence which ultimately defines a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for bre@@ eders differ from land to land , so if the O@@ ss@@ i obligation is not simply to be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conventional cul@@ tured plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it is directed against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents for conventional cul@@ tured plants .
however , a statement is not a law yet ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch Organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed companies and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from whole East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards the orientation of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems declared that the organization will currently build a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for scheduled next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development aid groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid agency US@@ C Canada , and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map , to publish .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - represent the opinion that farmers have to come to seed , to exchange and improve the seed policy and ensure a stable supply of food safety .
in this report the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will be seen .
&quot; the movement of regional and ecological foods has been respected in particular , where and how much is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Princip@@ al Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt , as well as the Arab world and reported over .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Princip@@ al Network for Human Rights Information remains bt@@ ful - despite this attack and mo@@ cking of the Egyptian right and the constitution in the Arab world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all the technical possibilities had to be exhausted , and not to admit the blocking . we hope to continue our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cen@@ sored page of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic language edition of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of side lock to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabian language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I there is no access in Egypt &apos;s blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he did not access in Egypt &apos;s accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he set up in order to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ gery of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blog@@ ger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video as police officers put on physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada was expressed in the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the to lock blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be more important to the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) We managed to con@@ vey the feeling of an uprising ; an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I didn &apos;t write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , after having locked him , and that they are afraid of words , I can always change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ ch go the way to an end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this revealed technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ ate .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers to be made using internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we realized how the locking of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s , started .
such practice suggests the intention of government to block content and filtering content , which might have access to Egyptian users .
the situation will also exac@@ erb@@ ated that the c@@ ens@@ ors decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction , by which they can act on trial against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
fight the inhabitants .
the Brazilian army was used in the fav@@ ela housing in N@@ iter@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day for day , newspapers in Brazil have made head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro will be killed , &quot; President Tem@@ ers sends 8500 soldiers of the army , navy and air missiles to Rio . &quot;
the violence in the middle of the economic crisis and in a close @-@ ten@@ tion financial situation reached the highest status in 2017 in Rio the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organisation Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .

extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual off@@ ence , etc . everything , however , is published by the civi@@ lized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that as journalists do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Chief Editor of the Newspaper , declared that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war @-@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist noted that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas , there are some of which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the Editorial the newspaper writes further :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and her partner .
is the name &quot; War &quot; more than it is profitable ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed against the violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is because of their opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to discuss responsibilities at the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra is shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio themselves - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ ing neglec@@ t of public service .
reminder : the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent site in Brazil , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , is wrong : &quot; 22 out of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are in the north and North east of the country . these are the latest information available .
no such cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we have to view the murders per Federal state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , emphas@@ ised as C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly been repe@@ ating its security policy for years .
in addition to this security policy measures , the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit formed by the state of Rio in 2003 , aims to conquer a major police officers to conquer a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this did actually lead to a decrease of non@@ violent deaths . since a couple of years ago , the U@@ PP took part over Sch@@ ik@@ anas and repression against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the term &quot; civil war &quot; by the Geneva Convention .
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for people .
for this calls for the state to use funds and ways which are typical for a war . the entry into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp spot in the countryside and an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ ment &quot; and &quot; sp@@ her@@ ed balls . &quot;
war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ ela housing in Rio will continue to suffer .
a week it is now that the police reach the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho cl@@ om@@ m to prevent death of a police officer .
in the midst of all these violence also this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit smo@@ ker died due to shots , which had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : learn to plant terra@@ ced Syrians , to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , located in Damascus and surrounding , Homs , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ li@@ b currently around a million Syrians in a state of the siege .
particularly strong is the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack involving chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 resulted in the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , those of the rebels controlled territories outside of Damascus had stood under siege , which led to citizens to be taken on local or through tun@@ nels and control points .
by the years of block@@ age , traditional food agents such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and acade@@ m@@ ics represent the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and lead the project together with the Al Ad@@ ala &apos;s NGO .
fung@@ i does not belong to the traditional , in Syria , and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes its food to an attractive food source for many people in the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the right of the project , Maikel Nabil , said to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; we opted for cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because it can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to declare this project and squee@@ zed his relief , that there is now more and more &quot; awareness . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to plant 125 families of plants to grow mushrooms , so Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have reached over 100 % of the expected target of around 12,@@ 700 million , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do by Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel short@@ age , the fuel will be used in plastic , to supply the generators to supply the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they started working with the &quot; Produktion from the regions of Medjugorje , &quot; before they tested their quality , and they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this result , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , it is distributed anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free .
Dr. L@@ eila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach human fung@@ us from different reasons &quot; : fraction of siege .
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self catering , by re@@ lics ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) to profit new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , who are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible .
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas , and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 financial crisis
several hundred people protest@@ ated on 21 October in many regional capit@@ als in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires that ramp@@ aged in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the fact that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the G@@ ali@@ zi@@ en region of Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bur@@ sts that spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande was a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to European forest management system , the forest areas were supervised by satellite photos alone in Portugal only 500,000 hectares of forest have been burnt down in Portugal - an area of the magn@@ itude of Lisbon .
to make you a better picture of Ernst the situation you can : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread themselves in the network and show images that allow better insights into the food :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting forces by the State .
people wondered why the civil protection was not capable of com@@ bing the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did this Sunday , somewhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would happen again in June , because the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits are in@@ jo@@ yed in o@@ int@@ ar@@ ities with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a wide proposal on the Wal@@ lo@@ form , which the government had brought after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the municipalities that the new rules saw as obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the construction activity of the case , if the applicant could be an open door , so that everything could be built , &quot; by JoÃ£o Sor@@ val is continuing in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it clear that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of light fire@@ able wood , as far as in a v@@ icious circle , as far as in a v@@ icious circle .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal is on 15 and 16 October , when residents were seeking information or attempted to contact the nationals .
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : it used its own civil protection data using the F@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so decisive for this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users , which followed fires , did not exceed the site more than half a million .

the road from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneurs

during a night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a devastating war broke out between the different mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
just at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in G@@ haz@@ ni province in Central Afghan for the last time with his family at supper .
even though his mother did not say so then , she knew her son would not see her son a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and kill him .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat leaders were murdered just by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulner@@ able .
the Taliban is getting closer to the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
several days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish@@ ly sacks with mort@@ ars , who were heavier than he himself to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we worked as well .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung a nylon in front of the open windows that we can &apos;t afford at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
after the dangerous journey along the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek government had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day to food in needy .
it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers in Italy . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find asylum seek@@ ers in the country .
the civil society of Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special admission centers . it is an impro@@ vised equipment in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a recording centre , when they officially filed an application for asylum - which can be sent after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers .
by then there are people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it succe@@ eds also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his self @-@ handed life helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
after several years working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af mo@@ cked his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel , and a sn@@ ug@@ s .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is Succ@@ ess Story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wah@@ i@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , for the 24 time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , 20.000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution to other European countries .
in recent years , some of our companies were created , including cutting sites , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of the Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is nar@@ rated by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes - the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Padua and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghanistan .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to reach far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail sector and aim to get back to the country , which he had to leave less than teenage boys .
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country , and I can not be happy if I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of the society and must get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also ten@@ ded plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , which can learn the men &apos;s packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest@@ ing effects on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey herself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .

the Egyptian Parliament also checks a bill to bill , which suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency .
users would have to be able to use the social networks , within six months after the most successful legislative decree on the website of the authority , stating their full name as well as their identification number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the En@@ tri@@ bution of a criminal payment .
the law , which was applied by sixty member members , is currently on legislative and the Parliament &apos;s constitutional committee and should deb@@ ated there .
in May , another deputy was a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the accus@@ ation of President or high officials .
Egyptian law is the popularity of the President as well as state @-@ of @-@ government agencies . under the law proposition a such thing would be imposed with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ take a political climate , where the right to free expression of expression and assembly freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud plan Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , demonstr@@ ating violence against protest@@ ers who had led to the alleged president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as much as 700 members of protest@@ ors were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a court date .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on the 20th of May because the prison line of human rights groups failed to put the def@@ endants from prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are united , spot@@ lights , etc . weapons ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case a pen@@ al court in G@@ iza welcomes the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage for pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentence of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists trained to pass through documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , which expressly also supports a controversial bill of the plan , the business@@ men and during the former regime due to dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption . official Am@@ nesty would guarantee that this will return all un@@ legitim@@ ate seren@@ ity .
on April 21 , the document published by Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , poses a light on how the distinctive plans to look for the legisl@@ ature &apos;s support .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia , the nam@@ ing of his sources stating from article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press co@@ de@@ xes , which journalists protects the right to protecting their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China im@@ pose the users of social media to make their identification ?
according to new rules of the information offices of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a approval before they write messages in social media .
in the prec@@ ep@@ ts there is also indicated that registration will be necessary with full real name .
analy@@ st assume that this is supposed to be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments in the social networks . it is un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese officials proposed in social media to submit these regulations just to sel@@ ective , in order to protect the journ@@ alism and independence .
then we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may locked up the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia &apos;s access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat should register in the state government as an &quot; organ@@ izer of the dissemin@@ ation . &quot;
this designation is part of an Act of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organize a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law allows the government to make responsible for the removal of contents , and to force them on request to exp@@ iring user data .

it is the first time that Turkey blocks the website completely . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
