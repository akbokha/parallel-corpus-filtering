<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American authors have read and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist for an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he was playing the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who discovered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnum, who wanted to overturn his interest in the Supreme Court of Justice, who wanted to occupy his interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>

<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very swelling message about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the tourist attraction and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as they say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he considers, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afromaler and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican Presidential elections was the highest number ever reached by the party nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigotto person, I asked?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was not able to know Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, people from all over the world, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung also voted by Peter Bhatia, the present author of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," published.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" on the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity due to Sandy Bahr, which struggles with Sandy Bahr, struggles for their lives for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with much patience and suffering from me and my colleagues helped to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise council helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those with them embodied values deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump moves his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 there were over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The idea of the idea that people voted for Trump, because they shared his racism and fanatism, because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it's unfair the tump voters to be regarded as roassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears of hectic changes are not taken into account in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those electors, of which most white are, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruelly decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (anemy.) means: as much as "Rejection of the White against all other ethnicities," Word match made white in playing on the White and Whiplash, which means such as big Van Jones, has exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you like always have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose the son of a Kenianman twice as his president, his story, as he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise to say: to Hell with versatility, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the rudder, say they.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think to Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who is in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump," my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America? "Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" bruises the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos offer a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called and their voices were loud.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone not, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your United States." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen, he sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, the news said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both places does not only change the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists - but worlds away from the nearby iconic ruins and its iconic cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La Banda de Música (music banker) has been playing in the community: one of children and adults of existing symphony orchestra, which, with its musical instruments, has an opportunity to overcome them to overcome them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexican, is known for their drugs abuse and the bankers.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI complains:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue its great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They are always laughing and playing with shining eyes and play in the action you learn day for trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from litter</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital of Paraguay, on instruments which are made of recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments, which consist of local firm waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under management of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpets, trumpet and percussion.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local wine cologist and music teacher, reminds of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First of all, it was very difficult because we did not have a place to rehearse and we worked at the same point where parents worked in the litter. children knew not music and it was very difficult to contact her parents, because many of them live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something, which he had never seen before: one out of waste produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments made of reprepared material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary on "Lands Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage deduct) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational scene from litter-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had been operated by illegal fishing fishing in Liberia before the other African coast travelled to Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and tilted slightly, to welcome a criminal criminals of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Komors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to add one of their harbors and refused to share a fishing permit.</seg>

<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch there fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, due to a predation of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative to cross the criminal practices and conservation of resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal fishing (underground fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, besides Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries, which then had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegal fishing. this project offers FISH technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden, which is extremely difficult to track. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate contempt of existing laws, through which certain living spaces and types are protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can damage which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles, with the information between different countries, the actions nowadays happen in real-time, traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange programs existing licences, news to suspect activities or details, which you noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive, when moving these on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to mark ships that fishing in banned areas - such as those who indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such examinations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing licence, where they were on the way, and possibly even if they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing are based on this information then informing such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot be sold their load. and that they could even be forced to pay a number of penalties, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>

<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an exert company that sets up for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also includes FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD to lost sales in order to lose the eight members of the network of HISH - each year due to the illegal fishers to penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region's commercial fishing in all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices including actions, such as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying phantom sores, fish-protected species and fish in nature areas.</seg>

<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me "." and just this legal conclusion is trying to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks, which had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued volatile ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the International Authority for Crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over big distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations show us quite far in the networks of organised crime "," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to provide suspicious ships of precise ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, helps to hide the illegal vessels that are like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. "" "" Duncan Copeland, Head Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be geortet by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that combines different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence on this without doubt a global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oceanic Organization: a platform that provides satellite data, and it can be shown worldwide with the position of each enceable ship worldwide.</seg>

<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run, with which a global system permits the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities are not just criminals but it can also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were fished with no license earlier without license, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH competi now account for a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats gain more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board locks, whose use is forbidden.</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela appears to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, what makes it noticeable in everyday life of the Venetians by a acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of fundamental change in the official launch of Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately, the posture of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises to the latest article in the context of government regulation:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate and antaltrates are estimated to increase food and medicine, the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to conquer its institutional structures and to join a new government alliance.</seg>

<seg id="165">The appeal was commented on Twitter, amongst others, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and was published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quixano was forced to attend the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quixano, in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in Cordoba came up against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were committed to crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quixano is not looking for his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the office, the same name as His Father contribute to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, whom he observed at the age of 15 he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he maintained family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, you don't realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realise that my father was a thief, a murderer, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quixano was Gendarseneofficials. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quixano, the oppressed who was accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quianos son, a man who, in the course of the years, knew the extent of atrocities which he had experienced as a boy, and who had said before a Bundesgerichtshof) against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent about his child, and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to join me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had been friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All they called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you are friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they will not lead you one day, and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The short ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the Military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">So he forbade me to go back into the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would be a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father walked me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured '.</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small wrapping piece in a blanket, and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut down and stopped with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in and saw a Liege which were tortured on people.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later, I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tiled there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They tied a man with handcuffs on the bed, overthrew him with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts in the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The smell there was horrific... like a dirty sound.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same odour came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father participated in the work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and carried to their eyelids.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, an civilians who also was indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people lay down on the face down - all were bound at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the entrance of the squashed people quietly on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners, he said, "Why do you look so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I thought "Why have you ever brought me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and put down by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told her home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed one man.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to data from survivors) Jorge Romero, who also was indicted in the La Perla Ribera process, was also indicted by the students Raúl Mateo Molina.</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla memorial, leads through the former torture chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The way, where you came in here, is also the way that came down here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of emptying a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came to be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the Euphemism - for shooting the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war trophies'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible stolen things to go home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "war trophies" - how they called it.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it was clear to me that war trophies are a bayonet or perhaps military demarks, which one has fought against an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if one walks into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... steals, it is not a war yield but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I was always asked about how my father, the leader of security forces, could join this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals and I answered: and you, who put on the street in the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded with rage, struck me and cried:</seg>
<seg id="282">When you go so far, I will find you and kill you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else!</seg>
<seg id="284">That was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory to him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process, I showed a photo of that, on which I wore a jacket and a skirt of wool. I had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time the defence asked me to have been a fellow at this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay hands on what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to say.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abicious act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I feel repented.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if one only has children, one knows the value of a lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognizes that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went to say so far:</seg>
<seg id="295">So well, you exterminate men during the dictatorship, but for what the corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children bring children?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl with home, whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">It was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">But it would have been simply put to prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but for what is their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Were these people not also families who could not pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhorical act that you can do for a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were crushed and disposed somewhere - no idea where. "you will never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But anything remains of course.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i've seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clear it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, which show my father, arose during a conversation, when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made him accusations because of all the atrocities that I had to be experienced for him.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said, "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt adventurous, and asked me why all the excessive patriotism and the "western and Christian feelings," which they allegedly defended, were actually good.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you have compelled me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only said, "No, I show me."</seg>
<seg id="320">This is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010, I posted the first indication.</seg>
<seg id="322">I was finally recognized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can suggest that I am dreadful. I finally spoke against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="330">After four years, in which more than 581 witnesses were heard, the historical La Perla Ribera process was completed because of crimes against 716 victims in August 1975 and December 1978.</seg>
<seg id="331">43 agents were found guilty of crimes against humanity. the court sentenced to life sentences in 28 cases and sentenced in 28 cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years. in six cases there were acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="347">In Kyoto's Kyoto's Kyoto, customers have been granted a newly opened centre in which to extend its driving license, last month witnesses a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word spread (koreiuntensha), which means "older motorists," probably falsely - maybe - but also with malignant backgrounds & # 8212; as "awful motorists".</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September in electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Elaboration of the original photos of Joshua Levine, which was divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake had been a translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was it too, who was attentive to the local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun, Kyoto, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it be such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The flawed English translation has been removed first. the name "Showdrivers" (German: "horrible drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate if the grammatical name "Elder Drivers" (German: "older drivers") was replaced.</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto's police apologized for the translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text, which they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked on their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt due to inadequate correction (the translation) on the other hand," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News set a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awfully" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are involved in accidents are due to concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this is equivalent to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors took 1.803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Their share increased to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of deaths caused by seniors caused the same period in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The eminent not mentioned reporter delivered in the version of article comments to the light which show the prejudices some Japanese seemingly against older motorists:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For transferring, one requires two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and the active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is in native language. generally, the conviction is that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native languages.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker was translated into French by English - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese company employ no staff with English as a mother tongue, who could justify the translations into English. this may be a lack of understanding for the overtaking, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers, Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who even have no foreign employees, do not leave translations to justify themselves. then, the Japanese company, whose English knowledge is considered the best to be a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The distorted and mystifying propositions that arise through machine translation, show that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the peculists English gracaries in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, who often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistical reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable, acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by great companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translation.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto's city will hopefully use a serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">Friday morning, April 7, the Venezuelan Internet user would have no access to the online station Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet has no longer access to VPITV and El Capitolio TV as well.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasts carried out recordings of the protest in Caracas that were organized by oppositional groups, opposed to the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April when the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a tractor. he pointed out that the connection is on to use and receive users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan provider is imprisoned again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular with Internet access, especially at times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been set for protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened to report them with fines and closure, if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I have registered with @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Astounding that it is still cheaper than to buy two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinintro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a blocking of the domain name system (DNS), but also two additional online broadcaster. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that the local Internet providers inflicts up to the DNS. thereby, it is a technique that assisting the DNS servers of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds or refuses the request to call such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS locking: @ ellimoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transmitted the protests in Caracas to Caracas.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody for custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV returned to broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels still have access to YouTube, it has also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: so that the Venetians will always be able to find access to multi-media coverage about the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a child of Criadita. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina fights for the rights of children and collects witness to other Criaditas who were just like her victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report by the curator who will be published by Global Voices with friendly authorization of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escušque Caen" ("flying cows, waste schools"), edited by Global Voices in Latin America and will be republished.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not staying with the family that was living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from the university, she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house proudly talked about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">The one that has become something, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one designated in Paraguay the more than 46.000 girls and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a big family with little money over their underage son or her underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What does not mention, however, is that the children have to pay for many days of homework that will never be paid or abuse of abuse and abuse, and all of that in the context of a contract you cannot raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This, as Criadazgo, practice in Paraguay is widespread in Paraguay due to its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating from her study, Alvarenga worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are concerned by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered witness testimonials, denounced and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She attempted to call the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated with criaditas, guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," says Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the one hand, the family, who exclude her daughter in the faith that they will improve their education, improve their position in society and "something out of himself" is over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes care of itself and justifies the exploitation by faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and might even be starving.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl becomes mistreated, his family will experience its family many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience them.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secret in paraguayan households, received a vision.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came into the hospital in Caaguazú, her body presented vestiges of heavy strokes. shortly after that she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who, as an official at the residents of residents.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">On the end of January 2016, Ferreira reached a stick to Marín until they suffered a fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of young girls.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">She emphasized that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the grave responsible for the death of the girl in the paraguayischen society. Criadazgo is responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest meetings and told that there is "no other Carolina" in Paraguay should be.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photographs were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it's very difficult to control, among which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couples and almost 60 civil society organisations demanding a generous investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who had her Criadita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes from court, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark, if the case of the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo ahead of judgment.</seg>
<seg id="454">The Life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited for workers, they are also isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to enrol and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the work and began selling on the road or on the market sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita into the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, it had to be able to share the time that you still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays she cleaved the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and uninfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at an end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="466">But this time was limited, because they had to make dinners for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had never been starving, but did not get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the householder than eating out of the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the budgetary, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who belonged to power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He kept it for intelligent, but did not say with her. "the master of the house had someone to listen while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they were not often allowed to visit my family, because they believe that I would learn there again" bad habits. "so they thought that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would speak to their native language Guaraní.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they were able to lose the education they would lose, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="474">It was quite clear, however, that she had paid for everything they got paid with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Even in school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about, are mobbing and the ikanas which Criaditas are exposed if they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents, is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite anyone home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time, where friendships originate, I felt particularly clearly that I was in any group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of everything, "says Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="499">Bill to register Egyptian users social media to register in the government</seg>
<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian members of Parliament recently ordered a bill to "regulating the regulations on the use and utility social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If it is accepted by Parliament, users must register users to use social media in Egypt from a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">Based on the law then a job would be established, which is tasked to share a permit to share social media citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of acceptance of the law, user would have to register users and users on the site of the site with their right names and number of personnel numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, this could be a penalty of up to six months in jail or money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that is running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced, as it is believed to be imposed by the law, as the Egyptian authorities are to prove the user's users and users that are not to be registered in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the government regulation is not able to ensure the regulation at level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliaments and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user name and users received a user name and a password in order to come through the firewall, the Facebook blocked. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for all the Egyptians, Egyptians, to access their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now, that such plans consist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on-site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "Senior Research Strategy") of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion it is so consistent that, as they were able to control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take it seriously, then it means that they will apply a strong monitoring system to unlock citizenship, or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of human beings and also to bring it to a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed during the legislative elections and the Constitutional Committees, before the debate has to be debated.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft "is in harmony with a per-military reasoning in parliament, in whose senses the control is maximized and ensured that no softer Narration is present on the surface area," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the past year, Tamer El-ShaHawaiy proposed a bill of law against cyber crime against Cyber crime, which was found guilty of life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threatening "public order," and "to protest to protest."</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the leopard family, native to Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to wild waste, loss and fragmentation of their habitat, as they always find less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza in the video shows, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predatory food in the Kurdish ecosystem, and the health and the marriages of the ecosystem depends on that a large predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in fact is small and goes against zero. as the team is in the video, so that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera all, breaks Raza in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, documented by the northeastern Japan, daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to reconstruct the life of the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its seat in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a prefectual prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring countries of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to leave, because the tsunami struck all the coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">While Fukushima Prefecture have experienced a nuclear accident, some of them had to leave its houses 160 000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows a local view which progress has been reached six years later in order to reconstruct the lives of local people.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese reorganization and the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The construction situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to december 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (showcases, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to list the greatest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes, while Fukushima at 70 percent provides the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, we always strive to accomodate six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behel's accommodations (mergers, Kazan su juutaku) to finalize the final substitute.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to endure.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such comfort.</seg>
<seg id="557">In 2011, almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated, which have been replaced after the disaster in residential homes, have been moved to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected Prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of fisheries in Iwates and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have returned its operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and nuclear accident damaged in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic failure, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed crops of Fukushima, are in the nuclear zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, the tourism has recovered far back, but also here Fukushima goes far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as in front of the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain a complete picture, the newspaper conducted a number of surveys among the native people and among the evacuated by. she asked them about the state of reconstruction and even as their feeling has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 per cent of respondents think that still not enough used in disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention also on the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima still had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was a witness to the worst, disaster victims, atomic accident, Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were located in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people, returned to Fukushima, a long-term spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still live, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes, most of the evacuation areas are more than 50 years old. it is known to recirate, because efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwates and Fukushima with massive building projects. this is the projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come from other countries that speak another language, the differences seem to be bigger than the common areas.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, it is often noticeable that more than it seems to appear at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important since they demand our prejudices, extend our perspectives and recall that the world is however very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at all these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast we will treat topics that often get fewer attention in reporting, than they earn.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over speech and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Toreta Camarasa is thinking about how the love for music has worked on the lack of joint speech during a journey in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back to his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">This week, a Brazilian student at the age of 33, was delivered to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer was defeated in Goiânia with a strike against the head. nationwide millions of protesters participated in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the university of the university Goiás, has suffered a skulls of brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operded him on this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus that rapidly spread in Brazil during a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the face of police officers is also recognizable by a striking attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio had been suspended until the preliminary investigation of the investigation of the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers as he proposes in Goiânia with his impact on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (Photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer arrested a protesters and landing at the intensive care station, his face would be seen for six months in television and the whole oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a newspaper-channel of media activists from Goiânia, divided the video from Luiz da Luz, divided by Luiz da Luz, to see how Mateus is attacked by police officers and subsequently sharing several Sanitary forces.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also dipped in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the shown below, one sees the attack on Mateus down from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet user has now donated 10,000 Brazilians in another state (about 2,700 euros) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to provide a family in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor of Pablo Ortellado calls for further violent attacks against activists in the Goiás memory:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence. here, the activist Irish was murdered by his father because he sabotaged the Occupy Movement in Secondary School, and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who was attacked on an intensive care center after he has been attacked by police officers, who has smitten him on his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Transfers</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to protestant police officers in the last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen were sitting on the protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for Redner, Gummigeschke and Tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Euro MP Flavio Serafini, social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against protesters in the number of speakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">There is also a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again the Brazilian media scrapped road protests by pushing the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disk.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo was aimed specifically on a fragile glass windows to illustrate the illustrative pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo preferred a title-story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic foundation, more about a broken shutdown than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also recognize, if one is striving against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Even here, the term "Vandalism" receives a absurd, disproportionate significance, and the typical nonviolence of the military police are made by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The additions of uninducing villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">By introducing the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Popular Congregation Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of what there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were put in the sugar tube factory.</seg>
<seg id="629">After replacing the sugar cane in the region stood still, and the factory lost to and after its plants, until only the smells of steel and concrete was left.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to be re-invent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some change the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commutes daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo envy that riseth every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar tube industry doesn't smoke out of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar production factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time they were in operation, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers hearing exactly that in Mañal I would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar tube industry has already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the poor administration decisions, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the production produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country in a few decades ago, but bad harvesters are no more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane disabled?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train station of the village saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The shredding of the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar tube plants were technically obsolete, and hardly more competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production deficit was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories, which can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar cane plantations, and the growth of sugar on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price grew before about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report issued in 2016 "Agriculture Organization" from the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the following years, a total of 98 million sugar production factories, more than 65 million people got their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, talking about the closure of the factory, the word that he is repeated the most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">To obtain the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Prior to the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written about documents that would only be removed in terms of parts that would be removed, adressate and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could prove every discharge.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility and letters came often more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the disclosed factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still existing sugar factories," he assures us.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in his will at the disclosure of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">In each part, which he removed, he discounted one of his 31 work years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area developed by Cuba and its main workplace was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases no alternatives were made for the workplaces and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut of Mammut of October 21, 2002, the former president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed to have been in operation for the areas whose factories were not in operation for five years.</seg>
<seg id="671">The price of the population for closure of the sugar cane</seg>
<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted only by polls.</seg>
<seg id="673">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="674">After two years, the popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always to the better if a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane closed, or better said it, when they began to dismantle them, they also listened to, the road to asphalted, this disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search for other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They have been to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Apart from the future, many young people left the region at once.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created, whose production serves not even for supplying the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new facility remains impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">In late 2016, Nene was back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>

<seg id="684">They torment him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene goes with 65 years of retirement, not because it is lack of force, but because he is bitterned.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youths of first Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do them through hip-hop, thanks to a number of wayworkshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, mobile recording studios have been connected directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in Nord-Quebec with ten cree-communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The Northstar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases with the fact that the young participants in talks topics such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever you will find in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos, where the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Since workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations-communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the Kitsummerum First Nation, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Westcanada, where almost two dozen mainly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite influences from globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although young people are unable to master the languages of First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation took up, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The following adolescents received some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan is the verse in address, as well as translation into English, translated here into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel, no one would ever get interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will take away our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life,</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise up one day,</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and advancing our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So, you can do this, for what she was appointed by the creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary, the reader and supporter of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution, adding the verse in sylls (which is also published on his blog and republished here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanyu (pendicts, "plastic models of the dishes") served by every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to making this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of these small companies that produce plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">Most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they do not even more strive to them. however, a new trend turns them today in showcases cell phones and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series published social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic shredded cellphone bands such as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificiously foods have been turned into kites, such as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokud refrigerators for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the area of food is increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular travel dish with seafood) has turned into a cell stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, who's holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the dresser.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and cell phone designer allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon rocheated, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can't beat my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appetizing form to surprise his colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell stand has the form of melodic ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and hand straps from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skillinoile plastic dishes can be downloaded under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to hashtag # 1.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is dedicated to the exposusement of the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="745">A Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime</seg>
<seg id="746">"for the victims of struggle against drug dealers."</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of all domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug dealers" in Mexico the mischief and gearing regularly affect statistics in Mexico. however, this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle involves.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the victim of conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or on the communities who have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each body, behind every bone and in the centuries-secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal TriPolítico has launched the digital project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug dealers, which is to give a voice and stories of people telling them in the struggle between enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many municipalities have to go many kilometres to buy something like that of milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vigeque cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear lives") tells exactly those stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father that seeks secret tombs after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father and her husband, her husband and her husband, only one day one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">Priest: "as every Sunday we are ready to prepare ourselves for the task that we have asked to go and to graves, according to the people we have loved to seek."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28, when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13 he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he was supposed to be back again, but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">Right now, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but they don't pay it out because they demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get this? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Apra a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who fear the fear. we have to show the international community the conflicts, fragility, and government leaders.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post in Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I know disease and sensation in journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I arrive every day at newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it seems like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't have the same or normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes further:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin would think that he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) when he's great. and it's not normal that people listen to the "heroic" of the offenders, when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, this is what they would have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they have something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories to block numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of men is unbelievable for me, when the death of six people and disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified, they have been "inflated."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade that they remain spared of such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months collection at the main city district: how a family had been plundered with threats such as armed crime month for month money from their business until they were not only destroyed the business, but also torn their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think everything you've lost and remember how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">Pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers as well.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it's absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are apart, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed its report with words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kill you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I was wonderfully asked if I would dissolve my profound feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the defined generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like the other boy of his age, whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells he himself had to teach himself how to make an egg cooked, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle containing water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life is from violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother is gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood lived already two years earlier, when he just saw a few blocks from his home, the bloody dead body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social issues in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 murders per day. this equates to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that oppose the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories live in view of a new headlines. this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apruna Vivir Con El Narco" has launched the journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to represent the complex information behind the failed battle against drug dealers, who has tormented the country in the past four decades, in comprehensible manner.</seg>

<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" by Flickr users Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this post and the pages to which it links, include pictures, on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lift up a rumor or a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is this the first time spotted? content in social media, no matter if true or untrue, tends to exist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been used to authenticate the tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This miscoupling of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - denied not the fact that there are copious reporting on events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But ask questions about our desire for pictures.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange at the East of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">According to the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated by this. the streets in the region became dangerous varieties full of strokes, which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically on the road tanker fell victim to victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">Fullness representatives described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including one movie nearby, which was full of people who wanted to watch the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses distressed and hollow bodies were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of a hollow body that insets on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But this is not the end of her story.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years ago the same photo has been carried out several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but fortunately not to be attributed to the supporting tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the indigenous communities of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically by atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down, dead bodies were burned in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count bodies," said a people on Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up period was shown on the basis of satellite imagery.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unexplained, but the establishment point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture came out of the DR Congo, as it was falsely cited as proof of the fact and the potential scale of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">Two days after Paris, a massacre of 2,000 people took place.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof for mass redness.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further take your comments as this example falsely falsely explained the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange has also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who flee, rakes, rape and some dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following that brought these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from a Saudi Arabian news page, which was falsely declared that President Myanmars Than Being said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image from DR Congo to clarify this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was finally picked up on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations, who called AFP to their source, were also falsely attributed to Than Being that statement, but had not thus taken the image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world's wide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Tracks of this false coupling cuts up to 2011 and 2012, and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "umped picture search" you can see how far reaching borders can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures found below 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the mentioned image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They originate from a mixed leaflet of private parties, platforms social media and communities as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as: English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some of them have passed wrong reports, occasionally have tried other attempts to unmask the counterfeits.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have introduced examples of the use of misused use and associated with the respective countries, on which side they had been published. as a result, we want to display the range more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of abused use can come from the listed countries (which in some cases linked also).</seg>

<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page claims that the President of Myanmar Than will have agreed in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims, and brought together the story together with the picture from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release, the picture continues to include.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article by 2014 concerning students who were murdered by Boko Haram, published by the catholic near the news page Análisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the image was not taken by the killings, but it claims it is a "similar dwindle attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture later, in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorfertilizer" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo, provided with this twitterhashtag, revealed a discussion among Muslims from the Boko Haram 2015 massacre and the connection to Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities found these events that were tentatively in the name of Islam, a greater attention.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was witched as proof for the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times), but the messages that were linked with this were never taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre was put into circulation, translated discussions like this in Vietnamese, and declared it to falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">The organization of the Claretiner Missionaries and Pater Juan Carlos Martos, from the Embassy in which the picture contained in the DRC.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey) shows the TinEye but are not fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamp do exist on the web crawler and occasionally they have imaginations in relation to Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture eventually bears a correct description, but the original piece is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (inhibitions) that go through this posts. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in terms of greater discussions regarding the silence in connection with the murdered Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is necessary to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give up longer faith in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are people who unintended to share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested by this mood of the failure and falsehood that actual atrocities are untrue and decorates the actual horror of what is actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of nonviolent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that it is recalled by pictures of refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images readers and viewers are despictze and feel the ability to empathise empathy (such as this study that examines such as nonviolent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are things to discuss nonviolent renderings in the news media, fact is fact that they are indispensable for current news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests anything, which is actually resolved from the context or to completely misused type.</seg>
<seg id="940">One of the investigation of false sentiment should however, however, should take into consideration how internationally they can.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranlatable (for example, untranslated), language enthused a selection of words from all over the world, which are difficult or not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these untranslated words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are rooted in a special culture (for example, Spanish sosteesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resists stubbornly every attempt of an easy translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not sufficient, why a full explanation and sometimes a bit of context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a full time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist of "Untranlatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find some words from the Vanuatu VAT, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemented you for your parents in recognition of how you have ever striving for yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsel language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"truck" - The ease or sloth that you feel after being warmed in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They grind other cultures, reveal other thought sizes and raise our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "untranslated" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Redner of "Treasure Languages," which are much appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite movies here.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They dispmused me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different kind. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims do not fit there, will be muscled.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Detoxy will be shuffled</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't get alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This is even the poet that poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was just as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim Ecclesiastical and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died, the centre of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But religion is erased in the western performance, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the reduced images of Muslims, Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting view is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The groundbreaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said destroyed the story behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures will continue to stand up today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continued to steer them.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I've worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I've seen how this powerful, faulty scouragement dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This Narrativ overshadow the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades, while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidature in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are being hacked, their head scarf in public buildings to cover and acidi-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that both sides are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group practice its "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong scar resonates Muslim women who lead movements to change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It looks ahead, that the first Muslim prayers were pronounced on American ground of Afrikaners, who were brought about this way with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer-Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This squieter has filled our collective prefabrication force such as deep and incorrect, that often Sikh men and children become aimed at timussian attacks and decorations.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we declare and due to the manner in which we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Among the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than just stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create Narratives, who help us to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has strongly failed to capture the scar to 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we have failed here, where seven million Muslims comprise at the highest degree "diverse" religious group in America. "</seg>
<seg id="1040">Over one-third of the whole Muslim population are an African-edged Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1044">Four decades ago, my immigrated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream.</seg>
<seg id="1045">My mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim, American Statiker from Bangladesh with the name Fazlur Rahman Khan.</seg>
<seg id="1046">Back then, when Khan himself thought the world's Skylines, my parents were Muslims and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1047">But I'm a Muslim and American woman now?</seg>
<seg id="1048">Sometimes, if people wonder why I don't ask pork meat, I say - instead of my Muslim recipes or my handsome tankers, all Muslims must bear with themselves - "from respect to Peppa wutz."</seg>
<seg id="1049">I jesting, we don't wear all tankers with us.</seg>
<seg id="1050">We also have to be no theological experts to be "Muslim" or to be selected by almost always for additional security checks at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="1051">There are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars, Muslim activists and interreligious activists who make an effort to fight far-widespread lies on Islam.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These lies are produced on the current volume of a well lubricated Islamophobia with money, think tanks, and experts for the falsehood, which is our already flawed image that is a Muslim; or what Islam is manipulated.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Because of stories we declare and due to the way we tell them, Islamophobia lies in more than just a stranger who runs the head cloth.</seg>

<seg id="1062">When social scientists describe religious life, they attack the following terms: believe, behaviour and affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1063">My Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible, but they are there.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Maybe I would see my girlfriend, my neighbor, my rock in the brance that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses.</seg>
<seg id="1065">She would see the Western ritual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms, and you saw the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Qur's.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Every one of them, I repeat three times.</seg>
<seg id="1067">I ask therefore, that they are protected from the evil one, the evil one, and the evil one cannot see.</seg>

<seg id="1073">Muslim is to say the prayers that they had spoken to me when I had a bad day.</seg>
<seg id="1074">As for me, the Muslim Brotherhood, as they taught me to refer to God, Allah Mian what God means, my only Lord.</seg>
<seg id="1075">For a people who founded - over the centuries - by a "Imperial Empire," which has founded a company dedicated to the name of a venerable British East Indian company Kompanie, it has a deep meaning of God to call my lord.</seg>

<seg id="1083">It means to know that at the same time, the grandfather of my grandmother, an Indian, washed away subject to the British Empire, was called "dangerous" by the newspapers of his time as he was the first mosque in England.</seg>

<seg id="1090">It means that more than half a million Iraqis buried under the ruins of war.</seg>
<seg id="1091">A Muslim Brotherhood is to know that the suicide rate among veterans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001.</seg>

<seg id="1106">It is the wars that we carry and the bombs we throw at the Muslim lands.</seg>

<seg id="1112">We are coming decades to recognise the roots of our fears, and the faults and dangerous letters that we steer in our news editor.</seg>
<seg id="1113">At least, there is a growing movement, led by American Muslims within the media industry, which tries to capture our varied identity and forgotten history.</seg>
<seg id="1114">The podcast Lake Something, Say of Something of Buzzfeed; the podcast # GoodWooBadMuslim; the viral video series beyond black, American Muslims; Simon & amp; Schusters Salam Reads, an initiative, proliferate Muslim authors, and Ms Marvel, the Pakistani, Muslim, American Superhero, all this makes me hope.</seg>

<seg id="1119">There is a reason for that conspiring theorist that existed in the dark corners of the internet, now the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1120">They are exponentially grown, because they have made Muslims with "others."</seg>
<seg id="1121">There is another group that has grown exponentially, by offering the "other" created.</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years ago it had not yet been given; now they have great areas in Syria and Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Things I have left here like a breadcrumb in my speech.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why do I tell it here at this TEDX Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and killed by the work of the "other" in the public performance, four decades ago became a researcher of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We must present ourselves uncomfortable questions on the role of this, consciously and unconscious, as it did my girlfriend and in the rain during the Women's March, because we did not have a new future in which we had no presidents, the chocolate cake is bombarded, while he already captains countries and "to others" people, go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It starts with all of us.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative arts wants to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">For stories, by Flickr-users Daniele Rossi, using the licensing CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now, despite a language barrier to someone with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about an initiative by Steven Bird, the Intranslated Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite such little different languages are not handed over to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project is:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world may be avoided, when we create cities, accept diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to include.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listen," "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers make their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storytellers, their dedication and representation are that the listener will indicate that.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laugh and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is being told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou conates the opportunity to clarify the history of the narrative of the narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the Beak of the Hasen and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having explained the importance of his label, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad grinsen he shares his sense of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can organize with TLS in contact to organize their own storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico requests from the United States to re-consolidate the sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">On 3 April 2017, with the aim of a new review of the public debt of Puerto Rico, on the last 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puertory Capitol, the capital of the capital, and ran until the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoriía de la Deuda" (Civil Code for the Neuronal Assessment of the debt) and the Ökomenian Church of Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">We also submitted a petition on the mutual debt of the White House of the White House on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people Puerto Ricos calls for the politicians, bankers and government agencies which are responsible for debts, for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial assessment and an Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, according to our working conditions, which remuneration in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt, which is not their own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be deducted with retirement pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the state alliance of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organisation with a focus on socio-economic development, a law relating to state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state of State.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed on the outside measures, excluding the participation, conviction of the citizens, to be dismissed from the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration wore the name "night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1181">Photo from the Facebookpage by Noura Ghazi Safadi.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives filed the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is focused in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the UK-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher of the book cost books within three to five days, vases from the book cost of Freedom: a Collective Inlie (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year, is licensed here and licensed here, contains a number of paragraphs that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are linked to which this is associated.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researcher and authors who have been involved in the movements of free knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog, which is our newsfeeds and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Pasha Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, which has been imprisoned since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted in the Adra-prisons directory, in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have since then no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title college memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">As Bassel pays a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us can begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of open source and digital activist, since March 2012, is detained in the Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra-Prison, a non-military institution, and transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer in Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel" had taken hold on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court in Adra's cell. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remains unknown, but remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively participated in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the internet and to make knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes are more proving than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct ancient ruins Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crosswise of numerous civilizations and here the Greek-roman architectural styles of hilic traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not yet knowing that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expeditions into the digital archeology and conservation are created a time capsule created for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not yet shut up this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent all my life so that freedom from dreaming and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name nenne.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned English to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other inmates to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees, as they are using computers, at least theoretically, without having actually considered one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of auditing (waiting), a prosabuch that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuged the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is licensed free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book covers of Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here's an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It happens during every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sing in the world of enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the occupation in the moment we embrace it,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers is no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, shackles and watchmen</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the crowd of prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I went in every detail of your voice and words.</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I carry with passion for me,</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes dared,</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I let another piece of my soul leave you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">In order to get all of the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence to weep and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the Bassel's detention, Ghazi wrote:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year passes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you're still in the cage of monsters</seg>
<seg id="1247">Bassels history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the protests against Bashar al-Assad regime in 2011, the Syrian network for Human Rights (Syrian network for Human Rights) has disappeared more than 65.000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime, were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011 Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in jail since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community announces the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We hope to repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: sentenced to prehenceforth due to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to a corruption incident in which a member came back after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is where Diodino Cambaza, who arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants, convicted of disruptions of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 euros) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique, whose Council Executive Cambaza was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">In 2016, Cambaza was released for a good tour and immediately called his re-setting into the company, which was then on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic which endorsed the application, there was no obstacle for Cambaza, back to its old position as the company did not complete a disciplinarising procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not mean the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrated dade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to establish the Director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback against corruption and illustrates the absence of transparency and even a backstage in relation to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we note is that the company should have become a disciplinarming method against the conflicting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company remained silent but caused no reasonable legal steps for the application of appropriate functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the ambience of social media, does not rejects this behavior, and considers the case as "contradicted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be consultants after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had taken half of it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep speeches and motivating words, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has promised to be reintegrated into the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Residue!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitter Viage, young Mozambique and student of political sciences in Brazil, says the director of any morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he was insulted it. I cannot believe someone has rewarded someone who has already insulted the state so much.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morality and to serve the State, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead has operated themselves on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handy it has become a inexhaustible source of money and the state itself, this man has become tired, the preloaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this guy has been rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief was put into prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, cut and - by the same: prophetric speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he confirmed that "an ambitious person is able to sell homeland for its ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if a ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he does not turn away from ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is also criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat for 10 years and escaped free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, with which he speaks of money, was again under the contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - Emergenitor (@ azmal _ Rafik) 12. may 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo from the magazine @ Verdade (to dt.: @ truth) states that crime is paying off in Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1285">In fact, in # Mosambik thief and servant of the # Frelimo pays off. # Diodino Cambaza, for long term imprisonment, returns to # Airports of Mozambique - Emildo Sambo (@ EmildoSambo) May 11, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1286">Facebook blocked the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas and age-like age.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information on Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin or are generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook is focused on the word "Kalar" or fracture (in burial lettering) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate language in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascent of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely aborted connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as an author against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight the hate in Myanmar in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Even today, 'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the Word itself is not calling automatically Hassler.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the Word, or doubts about their use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burial words with basic meanings, which have the same accounting sequences such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(age limit),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarcaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">One post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends on a spiritual way, if they had vented, how he could lieve his back pain as he made a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the questioner (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There are several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hes is that she will reduce hate language radically nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook has to be analytic before it extinguish all posts that are suspicion in suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write to Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post and check it out by checking the opposite words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spine).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dirty nationalists, the language of hate, will receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise your nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion is a powerful signal to all, the hate language is spreading, the efficiency of these strategy can't stop long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have demonstrated that the censorship of strokes often have a cat and mouse game where users can simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing-directed word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and told me the liken, post and share of content for 24 hours, because the Post "promised the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a multitude of posts removed from people who have no negative intentions, or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his postal mail has been removed, which has nothing to do with Hassler:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the Post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community for asking questions:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Writing such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems, as if they started this without a local context or technical assistance, and so words like "chair" or "peas curry" have banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they tried not to correct hardwood.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit, that would give them a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Remembering automatic censorship has sucked for a lot of mockery among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users can now write-funny and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of Hassler to see if their posts will be taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate language, but nevertheless:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The burial text reads "I want to sit on a chair and see a pea curry and see a Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the post, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, then will you cure people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, an agreement in social networks should also preheat violence in the municipalities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine territory, where the conflict between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been designed for his failure to bring out the outdated Hasselt to his burmese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather, instead of scratching the word 'Kalar', it would have better to read on context than code-based initiatives and learned from them.</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago is at the end of the children</seg>
<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously decided a law to offer this practice, so that the marriage is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of adultery, a certain members of Muslim and Muslim religious communities were held in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country, gathered that the state must not intervene, as that was, at the age of maturity.</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago has defined a contractual partner of the UN's rights, the minors of people under the age of 18. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had already been married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal State's Statistical Office affirmed that by 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitioning and social media movements that strive to abolish laws with claws, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. no doubt, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for instance, had no concerns to say the criticism of children's criticism, they should not take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition racked uncomplicated cause for tensions in this actually uncomplicated point, and eventually coincidentally, whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's toe - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, that could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would have him to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and proclaims the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators announced a status update on Facebook which Leslie-Ann Boiselle reposted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Lord Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft of the bill was voted for the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not one of the two.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once he was elected in the Senate, the design can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws have been finally changed to the children's toe.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who used a Minister of Ministers at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary tannins used to waste the kernel of the matter, but do you know what? the children's toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is almost worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel in the opinion was that it took long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook of Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:,, outstanding news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage court has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil group, which is quite openly about how important the adoption of the law may be noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The married life in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft of marriage was adopted today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were opposed to have voted against the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's toe is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childmarriageislet.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who have clipped him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Maharaj, the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma, Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Some months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to have his promise to be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General, Al rawi, a supporter of the law, said it is quite lawfully when Maharaj tried to act against the law, most social media users wish to deal differently on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of keeping the discussion as general, in a way that we can address the state into our bedroom, simply specifically that we may protect the state into our bedroom, that it may be abused by large, hard-preserved men who are abused against them in the advantage, would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law, or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children are legally legally legally or continue the norm, although there are laws that they say.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was shown on January 18, 2012, with the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally advered internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has now been disclosed the popular and based on the crowdsourcing principle-based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Every day, it's clear how important the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology experienced users are used to use converting tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most of the usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been issuing articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University have been held annually since the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world, when it comes to Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages containing the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform hammered all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (thus calculator calculator) which is not based on the system of domain names, thus making a complete censorship hard.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is also available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost reports IPFS about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (via the lock of Wikipedia), we used everything to cut snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform, so the ability to decentralized and distributed the contents into decentralised and distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view all Wikipedia contents, even if they can't get the site www.wikipe.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to get around the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli from Wikimedia Italy, a Mirror Side of Mirror, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorsides when the country is locked in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in Panigiri's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One can get to another URL, which is not the original. that is what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the servers lead the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself if these are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">There is a lying rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar giri was with the photos that he looked around and never satisfied. they were blurred with bad positioned motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry a camera to yourself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar is trying to bring Nepal as animal world into the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home village just next to Chitwan National Park, it offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that directs attention to Nepal as animal world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described them on Facebook, as it helps him to perform this first-class location in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home when suddenly mistaken (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was found, and I immediately started talking about pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives a collaboration with the authorities to obtain world-wide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so furious how they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already tipped tigers from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger lets itself do not disturb by the belief of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was too, because of the darkness in the way home, when suddenly the king of the Buhek appeared. he immediately puts us up and hit me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal as nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived in a tent in order to take place in the Bardia National Park recordings from Otter. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared at Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-published here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, there are women with greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands, or even from older males in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences should they disregard the norm, practice this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Othera by a proverous court and chattered by their family and the village community after she had addressed a secret relations with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also did not call her name, is also common among men. however, they have far less to fear or fear if at all, they shouldn't follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune, on Maharashtra, nine women, including health staff and housewives, joined a unique club and became quickly became the main chat theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to discuss and discuss the qualities of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">One of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # Khelbadal campaign, operated by the community Video Volunteers and relies on for the breakdown of Patriarchate's Patriarchate community.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paige has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's position up to the ban of HIV- and AIDS infected, and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how this club was created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously made Bottom of the wallets at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which showed Rohini in their discussion round, did not know women who did not call her husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has opted for this issue, because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem allowing women to easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The names of their husbands did not speak according to pronounce, is a custom which they hold on all obligations and never questioned in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini thinks:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition tells us that a woman respects her husband and wishes for a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this will be regarded as uncunning, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have made our discussion about this discussion then.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning I wanted to have Rohini who had never called her husband to the name, at home, to try out how it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me about and said that I should name him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage Rohini started their first discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" yet. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family would be protected from all girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini requested each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they like, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of her husband on the lips," says Rohini Paige from the village of Walhe in Maharastra over the Brechen of a century-old tradition in which married women who never married the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy that, during all the exercise, she was only afraid of him; another chose to leave the full frustration against him and his family by taking him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In the Adrenalinrush above, with an ancient fires broke out, the women decided that they would actually be able to make their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they counted their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini to and asked what ideas they put the women in his head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-mother moved her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation was made in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as traction of the zinnoberred point at the forehead, which shows the spstatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the cinating red point if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to wear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have stopped working completely, but mean that they are now in a better position to choose, not to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Papb is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip in every discussion lusion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to make sure the women make sure what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the past months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes, they danced and sang and talked about things about which they had never imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working for so many years for such problems and yet I have also talked about some things, for example, as our identities were knotted, never so honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say that certain things can be said, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is that okay, but some wanted to have a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt of a pants, wear; they did not darnel.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion on the advantages of their own wardrobe, the morality is associated with saris and much more, decorate Rohini their own pair of ctas (upper hemden) in a discussion round so that women could bear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can carry jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion lub has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are slow to rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have done only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">One or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women carry now at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion lubs know that the changes they would like to achieve in their lives - like the line of more freedom of movement or the own wardrobe, at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is everyone of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know there will not only be limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, when every woman goes home in the club and tell other people what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which probably recently has been made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incarcerated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has moved attention to international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he has been hospitalized for liver cancer in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (statute), after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that calls for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has declared Lius case as "an internal matter," and a speaker told it as "not needed to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Yet China continued to claim calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow for a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict management of the Paares in Beijing, others are withered away.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Hands Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met in late June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesperson, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to enable Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brent have refused to answer questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway got into the impact after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government had hastened that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon tours to China, as exports since 2010 were mostly blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release, and invited Liu to take his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Thanks to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The European Union, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she hastened in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We at the same time, China expects all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all visits, they wish, and able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad shared with the fact that Americans thought "him that he has the opportunity to treat the treatment abroad, unless it was to help him with his genius."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, gave the news agency AFP on June 27 that the message left the Chinese authorities not to release Liu, but also to free Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The claim of the US embassy moved from China to itself, with the outside of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country have the right to intervene and an irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel accessibility and access to medical care of its choice in which they are entitled to a Chinese constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to pushing the Chinese government to eliminate Liu and his wife conditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I demand China to release the Nobel Prize Laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, so that he would be incorrect medical treatment in proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">In July 3, Berlin, the German government of Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu "receives all the medical support which he needs," and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese president Xi Jinping was issued on 7-8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing's news agency that China had great concerns, whether the Wirbel could hadow its visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada, Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum, called for China to provide reasonable medical care and provide the opportunity to provide himself with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told him that Lius wife, Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not permitted to speak with someone else, including his lawyers, and contact us.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada called for China to commit its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, to preserve and disclosed the rights of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, which he, regardless where, needs. furthermore, his wife and family are to have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the broadcast France Info announced that the French government would welcome Liu in the Land, the State Department announced that there is no further information that France would eventually receive him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of landlandaffairs in Taiwan called China on June 27 to release Liu's release and for a larger tolerance towards those who demand peaceful funding to demand political reform and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Labor Party in China also called for the sick of intellectual Liu to treat Himself in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself in a statement on 28 June by Liu very concerned and gave that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been punished for a harmonious, more stable, and wealthy China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moving and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspires by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, liberty and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Singapore is a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Justice Minister, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to consider as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the State Association of New York State Association, the Minister informed that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party in Singapore, as compared with other countries in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supported that Singapore should be considered as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, the most people go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifice, this valuable country is to be created, one can say that we ultimately will not be a land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had an attempt to escape in the responsibilities, a must offend.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore in other 'normal countries', in view of which, he appeared unobjectively undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities that are led permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritative machites appears again to be preceded by the democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week, the answers from Shanmugam was given answers to its American guests in regard to our press, our Judikative, our political system really not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate issues can be cloaked with non-answers rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng demands Shanmugam on his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our advertising K Shanmugam would go on the trouble to clarify this point if he paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on the blog, he points out on the critics that one should start to read the entire codex from the conference, so that we could understand the context of Shanmugam's statements better, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the script.</seg>
<seg id="1711">As he said, Singapore is rather a "city" than a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore are so unacceptable, even if we are looking for free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, making such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore has said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that awaits me - was I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he believes this really, right, and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review zeres the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a freudder's speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, there is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the Intergovernmental Conference, the statements made by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but only defend their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the residents of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">In fact, the Journey of a Decade tends to affirmation, Singapore is and always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have offended many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear papers like "the defense of the country especially" etc., but that is not quite right.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1736">The myth of the "nice Canadian"</seg>
<seg id="1737">The Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot of a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked short of his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect at your home country or home country?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, being exposed to rumors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another facet.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most obvious to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry." I am from Canada. "I am from Canada. since 1994 I live and again in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation in which situation takes place, it is considered courteous to show interest in his talk partner by providing personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification, then the default answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook in mind when they are kept for Americans, but don't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little different from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag right at their backpack when they arrive.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small maple sheets on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons in us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriage have been legal in Canada since 2005 now!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Obviously we are obviously very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered to be the tolerant country in other ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Firstly, I have many American friends who I admired very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">There would be nothing to me, if one would switch me using Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">Marc out of Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly: when "nice" is called "nice" in essence, be splicating - as such a good, gentle, but tragically, very significant figure, Ned Flanders of "The Simpsons" (who has a Canadian double star).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would have a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would actually be a step forward. but the actual problem exists that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can stumble.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Be harmless, being inconspicuous and ininteresting to earn and make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be something good when you want to remain unnoticed in the background, remotely from the things that pass around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even come as far as to say that the desire to be free and only to be one of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What the existent as "nice" is perhaps simply just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians often don't talk about the fence with their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are missing the warm hearted, open friendliness, which I connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau then entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our prime minister has made Canada sincably sexy.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parody by Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">One of Thailand's famous pop band has published a music video which took power to the Junta, which took power in 2014, and despite their promises to restore civilian government.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) the band tattoo describes a young man who tells of what his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the continued military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet uses for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">During the first three days, the video uploaded on Facebook has been shared 1,254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, Charlie Chaplin-Video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists stripped the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policy, especially as it stands with the situation in the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand will have pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 Rules of girls" may refer to the draconical section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, with the commander-in-chief of the Heeres absolute decision making up important national topics.</seg>
<seg id="1790">11. rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of the "deployment of journalists" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered to be a critic of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law relating to computer criminality, its vage and unclear provisions often used by the authorities to relieve activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, monitored by online content and persons who were accused of having slandered the monarchy, was prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is a strict conclusion against "Majestic Majest" (Majestic reading).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to purchase is their decision to buy expensive submarines, even though security experts warned them that the purchase should be unnecessarily, and an wastage of tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it's even shown how people will be thrown into a black vans before they bring it into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison, because they have allegedly caused "confusion" in society and threatens Internet use long sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the Teaser of the band showed members of the band that had previously used the salut of "The Tribute of Panem" that was already used by coup opponents during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">There are now over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchasian War was officially ended, but his scars are still very visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show distinctive pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the coal basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, depreciation, Georgian and Armenians lived and worked in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most Russians and chases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called violas towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today, there are only a few hundred people in these vulture cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Therarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of 16.000 people had barely increased after it had barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 approximately 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1847">About ten years ago, an older woman passed away with the name Galina (or Tante Galya, as it is named in the neighborhood) from Akarmara to Dschhantukha.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico, "Mama Africa" houses the migrants in their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez heads a small hotel in Tapachanlage, the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org. it appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I have visited one of these places in the Mexican town Tapachula, it is located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59th year old Mexican, a small woman with a coral pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in the teddy bears form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are in transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather not a charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare clothes, removable walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and haitian migrants have come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes Mrs Ramírez, tells people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast to call them: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is rather quiet, but in this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on board boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them and bring them to the hospital when she is sick, she buys them medications which they can not pay, they massage them with a balm that exhaustive them out of the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurche) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracks.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answered with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to relocate her husband and his three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States, to make regular one first stop in South America and then go toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track" says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans were often travelling together the circuit and that the Africans speak on WhatsApp of Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his responsibilities, Michelet lived in Brazil, and worked as construction workers on building sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa for months: he sells the cards to save the necessary money to purchase the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he's answers to us. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells us that their guests send their often text messages when they are continued to grate them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught them to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez may be very popular here, but it is not the only hope for migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">On the other end of the city, a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family received migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and has found that the Buchets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings along the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his workplace.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachanlage comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to press money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for a lodging and an unknown, an all-petual, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives still here and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, passengers are quietly able to consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, much of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems to be happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma she leaves her album with numerous pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair stains that you made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly asks her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," it is repeated every time. "they have gone before."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Check-Point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang by Twitter-Users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, ethnic minority groups in the west of China, are forced to install spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile phone users received a mobile notification in the Tianshan district of Urumqi a mobile notification where the district government shows a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">In the communication, it is said that the App is aimed to obtain access to terrorist information. "</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities emptied the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app after having installed the app messages with a private chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police report it says that the app would determine and follow the terrorists' sources and follow the terrorists, together with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, by online fraud, Trojan and Phishing pages to make users attentive, how much time they spend online and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">These app with the filters for minors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can, of course, be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could manipulate public players or even hackers to manipulate or steal home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures relating to control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications relating to digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme zensors and security measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">On Twitter based media outlet "images from Mainland China" (sizelnuts), a censored news in China, photos of a checkpoint where the residents drew indiscriminately, whether they were installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint using a device without these software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have compelled the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (brochures) published a jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift up the key specifications of a Windows operating system and thus maintains unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the town council, to minimize spreading illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and the party connected institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of your computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi a decree against all residents and entrepreneurs, up to 1 August, their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks, and media memory cards."</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and annihilate any "terrorist videos" which violates the right rights of Urumquis's rights of three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a number of other possible interruptions, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1994">This is the first of six reports in a series "sleep or death," in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane signs his experiences in a Syrian prison.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Far from our blue, virtual world you look down and make sure you are all alone at a place where everything lately disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has been dissolved after and after disbanded and a truth reveals clearly visible, both inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One who makes their name all honor.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that struck down in a list of feelings and expressions, which allow no metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">But if the reality is back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors, the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubt loose in smoke and you will be aware of your existence, even though the earth is going on on the axis of the monster, you know that you are caught between the walls that your parents, and in front of them your grandparents, stone were erected.</seg>
<seg id="2001">They have arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to be "my lesson," as the boss of security intelligence has formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="2002">He set his power over us, by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were killed during a peaceful protests like the weeds from the beautiful garden of our Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was enough to cut the city the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">All the quarters were coveted, but my own not.</seg>
<seg id="2006">For the first time, it was quiet, at the wrong time, even though I had no high demands to a city that is stripped to the arteries with state security organisms and their complice.</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night the things felt a bit worried after the power supply in the neighborhood had to work.</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the stillness, by crying several times "Allahu Akbar" from my home roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice through the stillness.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to cooperate.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Many friends, true friends joined me; we moved to a splendid picture that fully filled my expectations.</seg>
<seg id="2013">In such a moment, you are aware that you delivered the spirit out of the lamp, but it simply doesn't care in the least.</seg>
<seg id="2014">I received a call from my father: "make you ready, we meet with the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return to your voice, after you put them all the way up to the office of security from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I now also.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The Colonel Ghassan begins to talk to: "let me listen to what you are 'Allahu Akbar', or you're only brave enough to cry out if we are not near."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hash filled eyes drew on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did, did nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood before this building.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Perhaps it was in my foolishness, peritelty, perhaps at the revolution.</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure as I answered: "I would not have thought that I had already forgotten my voice in yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">And I think I never stopped to look in your eyes, so why should I do it now? "</seg>
<seg id="2027">It was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I regret not a word from what I have said.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement and his father at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father is equal with this."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The smell of this cursed satin lies me up in the nose today.</seg>
<seg id="2031">He was sentenced to a "syndrome," a psychological torture which I was suspended for months.</seg>
<seg id="2032">I cry the yard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I let everything go back with me.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then again by the yard and into the second office, which leads through a corridor to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I preferred all the details exactly before I cared for the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise, they probably never shared a larger cell in this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I have to share it with only one other prisoner, and may not sit down immediately, without waiting for their permission.</seg>
<seg id="2038">After a few minutes felt like a whole life, the civil servants left the cell, and I grabbed his way to the proven communication method: with the fist against the wall.</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my comrade was an "Ersthainee."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After long hesitments he gave me ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Apparently in any of the surrounding cells there was a prestigious middle aged man who looks similar to me and called "the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="2042">In the perfect darkness itself can be seen in me no distinctive facial features, and doctors are not available here; we are all only numbers.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"maybe someone whose voice is similar to my sounds?"</seg>
<seg id="2044">All answers interfere with its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was relocated in one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The investigator had asped me, they would leave him free if I stay.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Lügner.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have had a scarecrow, in order to distribute all these crows, which lacks the fruit in my head of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">From the distance, I still listened to "Allahu Akbar" out of the distance.</seg>
<seg id="2051">It must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always around the time the screams, every day.</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black the color of perdition was, until I saw the yellow light, which presented us the horror in person: the Raad (about: "thunder," recording on the 13th Sure of the Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"they are here to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2055">With this, the secret had been ventilated: to protect the state of State and prevent the terrorists in us, they speak in alaweathic dialect - so they played their denominational represet card and ripped the close perspective of their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is no house here, that is not a country; it is a curse that they call Koexistential to transform the criminals of their clans into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I ask the hearing room and meet at Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least it comes to me so.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that withdraw to him: "my boy, you are still young, you can begin to join this day and to protest on demonstrations, which will soon come to an end anyway."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I'm accustomed to answer, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really say that when insults and punches have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication tool.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to be punished, though I had done nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">At the punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">Its command is to pluck me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the loving "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic pipe, which probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker has blushed on your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him and you cannot return your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams did not bowed down to him, so that they cast off the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">In my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had worked as a garbage collection, or whether this was one of the normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables in order to present ourselves, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them changed, while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any sense in my body - and my voice, why I listened to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker remarked the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, so it was a next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My bicker body, which lay stretched out on the ground, was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two dreadful hours, he decided that he had satisfied his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must probably have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lie down again. let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed by, who came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the dawn.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door open and the morning light is fulfilled the room ".Rout with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">I reply with the voice of a tired young people: "my lord, my father must make himself fearful concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and quiet, you will be transferred."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always been released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free opinion of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoke a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spend the most of his time inside; once he slashed out to his screen, sometimes at his computer, and again to the couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can depend on, is a cigarette between his fingers, or with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had been forced to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority, and their altreproven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music that is often dealt with topics like orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, it is also demanding the core of the whole Arab world. all these topics do not only find relevance in their hometown of Amman, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria to the whole of Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With 25 years of age, Hdaib sees himself as someone who has not been restricted in his thinking, and he can assure the consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it, he sweeps out a special removal against US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looked at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in conflict areas, with his identity as "Palestinian refugee's second generation" - so he describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life circumstances so" stresses hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think, because I'm a man," while he soldered the nest-café in two mugs. it is the holy month Ramadan; in that time it is foreseen for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption is illegal by food during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has given a certain weakness for it to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slick are warm coffee and the waxes of Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison under free skies, especially when you throws a view into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it avoids easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to be unable to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has canceled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some of the parliamentary substitution that support the Islamic Emirate's Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argue that the sexual orientation of the country is contradicted in the country of Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The Euro MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "was cancelled" due to sexual orientation of the sword.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many argued that the involvement of the volume in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression of expression in the Arab world may be dangerous activism, who authorized the official legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be silky rhetoric, but actually an evident-crystallized reality reflected in Jordan which is clearly reflected in Hdaibs work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib repeated traditional sex sounds to body by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had voremarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an evidently unknown woman, whose arms and legs will stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women, who have lost their lives through the hands of them that they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'Outmorrow' has risen in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch Group, according to its peak, reached its peak in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is still missing in order to support women, victims, victims, or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for interruption in 1954, women who are subjected to the danger of a family of family are exposed to unspecified time in prison, "and for her release, often a year of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee by the family is necessary that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to reporters from the themes in its land as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies his work is political, however, dream of having his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">As a result, politics was intimidated, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed, Hdaib took the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, lets himself continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can get into His words, "That is what you want" - whether it is faith or non-faith, heterogeneity, or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone talks about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals still in 2014 were censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib took an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, to remember that his comments were torn from the context, and has been censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without incisions, but only one processed version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance of homosexuals not disagree to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nus, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is wondering: if Abu Nus, who would like to work on behalf of the caliph, in the eighth century, could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanians do not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The actual problem, such as Hdaib, didn't have anything to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Swiss-Semitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government has sanctions against the free opinion of expression and that progressive voices are being put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service accepted several ex-government officials and members of the teachers' grounds that said they were expressed in the issues related to the issues faced with the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert of Hdaibs, only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to deal with structural changes in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is an independent casting and take out. Jordan has now denied a performance for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is made of slow, reasoned and inner changes. it is certain that these changes will take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib were dreaming, like millions of other Arabs, also from a Arab world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be inspired by music, art and literature of a true and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, spreading and artistes-led democracies. at least, he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib is stepping down and also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which allows Aman to be a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival that is usually celebrated in many areas in August. another theory states that the cars, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years, were invaded in the North east of Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A shared centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for a look at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two feats are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebutafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearance and body care were so important as in this history, because they are helping to maintain peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair of the hairstyle.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street smoking and illegal drug dealers are all daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of this region's population will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services to men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to give up the more normal citizen into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can rebuild these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The exceptional demand for hairstyles, which go to the outer edge of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts join each other to demonstrate who can create the excentrist Looks, as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, who finds himself in El Callao, found an opportunity to exchange young people to share their weapons against hairdressers and instead of bad advice a training in hair art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job, which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school was offered special training workshops prior to the beginning of March, and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only medical school in the community and the district where we are very proud because of the love of the children we have constructed this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the processed version of the "love messages of guerrilla fighters," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published in context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important, people who feel well-picked up, affection to your affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios out of the Young Youth Foundation no longer and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconcile), the young people to encourage guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the guerrorlair FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces) which forms the slaughter point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered as important to mark the signing of the peace agreement as the so important that Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of Colombia, there is a long way until one can talk of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla absorbers, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a rhetrhetoric, and around the clock its weapons contributed to themselves, to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, that had used to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hate against guerrilla fighters, must now support them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columnarians joined together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's objective are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighters - which will then be handed in personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation arose at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian took the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people who love to write on the Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those forget who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was going to plan, and he continued to share his love with people this year, which needed the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was created, letters full of hope and support for former fighter of the FARC, which now will have their place in society and create a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a history of war to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would be forgiven me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19th March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the town council of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation Bogotart reists to the camp to personally deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC behaved so much as they did earlier in order to accept the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of subsidy from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is unbelievable how many different emotions you can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between," told the political knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a assistant of the Governors of the Valle del Cauca Province described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter brought me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters are living), I saw a guerrilla fighters that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I said to him, "Hello, what are they doing?" he said, "I reply to a letter which someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I reply. "I suddenly caught my tears on the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him utterly, and set me beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, so I was sorry, all the years of the faithful companions of this struggle, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something different from life as war. the FARC was not expected to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I would never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there, waiting with open arms on us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned what to handle with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New votes</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and a few leaders of the FARC together came together.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up already as a war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we experienced the possibility of developing the social injustice by the State for the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making the company in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">It is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people who have never heard heard and had no electoral law, and to recognize that the people I had often seen as a monster, and even hate people with beautiful feelings, which were turned through their life circumstances and their environment was painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, in which the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have done and caused much damage to give us a bit and give a smiles and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columnaids were prophesied that after the disarmament of peace would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment possibilities, there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">At the FARC we now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology belong - to all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. among those who defend the lives as foundation of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasus region, are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and extortion.</seg>
<seg id="2244">Terrors have experienced activists of the last months beyond persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, like a Damoklesman over the dorff LGBTQ assembly is not only about overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us what is happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya took over the international headlines before several months after reports were published, causing torture and killing queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta, she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who took suspect queens and awoke them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a Transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they were grown, her mind became aware that Chechnya was not a safer place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens experienced by the gender equality of their country wife, the hunting was opened in Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life, she moved to the United States last entry.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">This was a friend of Dagestan, a transwoman who staked in difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone made some of my documents, he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture from me. "then there aren't men to eliminate any more in Chechnya who can remove these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents made the turn on WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was right there was a few shopping bag from the seat of my car, I heard a male singer saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard another sentence, but this time on Chechen: "how long will you honour the family, you regret?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I don't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up last duck in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had taken everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two papers in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulances were you laid - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor got up and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him, that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats of threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, and wrote to me - Related, strangers, some are completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightfall.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The slowed, to send me to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They created absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it that I run up without through the streets; others wanted I had not changed in the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets of grain size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this print?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you're a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she placed a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car was covered with darkened window wheels and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it came to the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the numermernes - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without paying me without identity, without identity.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived at and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you won't believe you, you were in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you stems. you even know your brady number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">In fact, it really was my grief.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the sexes, however, that is a tabular theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish it, this seatic barrier cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I give myself a trouble to look like the person who reminds them from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But it is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed dorton?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In the process, I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who was eating one and a half months in gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that while Ramadan was not arrested and tortured in Ramadan, but also that all could hardly wait until the end of Ramadan, and he did not shut a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Thus, I mean, they probably invite their relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a evidence that the so-called "glory" received through blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: do men still survive in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives, or those who were left from their relatives, to present the Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they might be able to present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they had attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">You understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were dipped to radicalise in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun for a one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone in prison, after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was involved, when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports. however, we suspect such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not allow these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore a hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in a Grozny, when I was still living there - and I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously! in Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was supposed, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia tried to bring us originally to the "Civilization" but ultimately rejected us in the stone time.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted, I had coloured eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of the Sharia has never faced me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spare not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children, if they are funny about sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut up her eyes before you because they believed, you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never smitten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts start?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow came into the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on morals on morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people were beginning in the city to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had laughed and laughed, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I'm working as a waiter.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I was still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I joined them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teetreffs, summaries, I understand her to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny a cent.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves, being shaken along the variety.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is align.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature, that has pure nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same like Chechens who would make you know with foam in front of the mouth that there are no swings in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the cabardiners who have Russians also; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is so unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know many think about Transidentity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trusion.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of emotion to be exact, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'll be so personally so personally, but my last time relationship is now last longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of self-morden within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong increase of suicide since the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The suicide of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27th, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahmadazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression and he shuttled himself for his own helplessness, the inability to come up for his family, Ahmadazi human rights groups who are working in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">On YouTube, a video shared the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it fast to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Talegger hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors couldn't do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide who has happened in August within the Arab Ahmadazi minority, and activists warned against it that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shaver Tamer, have been hanged on this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a matter in common: they were all family members, who were able to feed on their families by the Iranian government, helpless, and unable to pursue their families.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahmadazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community is based, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes the native Arab population hard to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">Before a century, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took power in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran, the oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most sophisticated and valuable agricultural areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy still develops only slowly, and the local population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and alienation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime refused to systematically dismiss Ahwazi Arabians to workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large variety of twilight, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian areas where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These strains have only led to destroy the devastation in the region, and the local agriculture, as well as the local and palm-trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab AHawaiian adolescents has now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who have completed a job, completed the primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahmadazi activist leader with residence in London, said Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" by the young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Kenji Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become even worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since Functional and Institutions do not prefers Arabic labor force, the local Arab Ahwazi calls access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">That is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance of young Arabs and to earn their livelihood outside of their home Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their surname and surnames to hide their belonging to the Ahmadazi, as even the Arab names will not be tolerated in the workplace, because the speech of Arab language or the wearing of Arab dress.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahmadazi must stand, the human rights activist alarm before the situation will explosively.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world awakes and knowledge of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I do not unify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionist"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photos. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion that was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react, especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They were wondering why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well, scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist, and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money in spite of the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still standing under strict observation, when it comes to what they may make with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later stumble in various fields of life to a glacne veil, and that discrimination are still moving across through the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is conscious and familiar.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I'm talking to skin color, racism, black Cis-women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the diaspora; if I choose whom we have already been missive, selically and verbal women, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to raise "their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing, to reach the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is a institutional form of racalised violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women other ethnicities and origin of origin less earn as white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand, I want all the women to have all the men and not all men any skin color; on the other hand, I can not connect to a black woman to consider the white woman who refuses to consider inequities in their thinking that relate to both the gender as well as to the skin color of one person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and will no longer struggle to fight my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always denied me and countless other black women and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">1851. in her speech, 1851 said in her speech: "am I not a wife?" and I also myself refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an unicuous and marginal nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, which can also be found in order to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to change white women the importance of the overtaking of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to disclose the significance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to revive them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women in different income and boundaries between white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissolve me completely and completely from feminism and set me to the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman, instead of me for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubbornly, that interferterality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever, that we will define black women in our own ideas and give us into the spheres that are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recall Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism) saying that we can defend ourselves on our own way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call policies and exclusion, after having read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can empt black women and women other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognised as part of my dark skin and as part of my life as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life has neither curated, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2467">This post of Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="2468">Under the line of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be reprinted here.</seg>
<seg id="2469">Maikel Nabil Musa in the past 7 years - usually traveled with Surfboard or in canoe, with a particular concern through the Kurdistan Regional Development. its mission aims to realize people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to its church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust, pollution and uncontrolled development lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - to protect the rivers, streams, streams, and water flows in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the honesty and importance of his work in a question: "if we had no water more, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced for ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, in Iraq, based documentary filmerin and multimedia journalist, produced, filmed and published.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and revised version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by cturally. this article is part of the # PorSermjer (# Reflichenefrauam), which reports about the Violence against Women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their partner who had become violent over violent crime.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would not be laid, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, the responsive display of Ada Báez did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman retired her advert.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women should refund ever, they do not receive any support from the stadium in general.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who have to admit victims of violence themselves at all in law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 hits and statistical analysis and a legal system that do nothing of any undermining 3 of the laws: good approach, defective controversy, and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to see how many women are really harassed, says Myrian González, a research scientist at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay. "there are several data and reports which, however, do not once appear to the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures below are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Office of the Prosecutor dropped 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went around violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police arrived from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">More than 5000 displays because of domestic violence among the peace-judicial power. here, 86% of the readings of women came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true depth of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's ministerial minister, only few of these offences are actually shown. "on every woman who refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women will not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">For every woman refunded because of physical failure, two women come, who do not do this, "she explained in late 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">As the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal offences, law enforcement agencies can not be adequately documented, how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Up to August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuses and a legal system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all their former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning they didn't want to do that, but then, however, they should repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer deal with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the deadliest:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought of being victim to mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I thought that only women seem to be submissive, because they seem to be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuses by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered her contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric if he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users questioned Mariana, why they had fallen that so long from Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least some innocence.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had abuse them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo-CREO network (I believe you) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias, everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads were in the authorities without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against her former partner who developed an inconsistent legal struggle between Paraguay and her homeland, where it was mainly concerned with money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, lacking implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applicable.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of abuse is a way full of resistors and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, sees major problems with the use of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill of bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Fürth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) is part of a campaign that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law is able to explain Femizd to a stand-standing trial and punish the case in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature was altered in some points to also win the MPs to the Law, which feared that the way for the decriminalization of abortions that currently banned in Paraguay is basically banned and sentenced to five years "imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was foreseen, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) of the process that need to bear the victims of violence themselves, if they just want to refund and receive a safe accommodations, to state the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective when the legislature cannot provide sufficient financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse are seen as part interhuman relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking must take place, violence is not taken more than anything normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever remains silent in the face of these facts, is indebted and bearing the perpetrator of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must restore so long adrements to abuses no more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed. among other things, one passage was knitted, which called the partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes are apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The debate on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor, to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the cancellation of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" of parts of the law is regarded as great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent Media in Oman a year under the prohibition of a newspaper continue to bade assault</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website has been closed due to a decision by the Minister of Information," is on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omani authorities closed an independent Arab newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he served a year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed before the court but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Saïd, who came to power after he had left his father, Said ibn Taimur, who had prevailed over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important branches in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Chief of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces, particularly civil liberties, including freedom of freedom, and human rights, independent journalists, bloggers and further activists on tortured, intimidate and imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities emphasized peacefully and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hinder citizens, even activists, about their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online as well as offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, which has been reported since its inception in 2007 over corruption in Oman (a absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, Chief Editor of Azamn, who was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016, published an article entitled "High-High Parties to the Justice of Justice." it was about corruption in the judicial authorities and the mixture of high-level officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the editorial committee, was charged to the special department and arrested at his arrival by security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS Deputy Chief Editor in the Yousef Al-Haj who had been chief editor for Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed at an indefinite period after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way, including online, will be prohibited from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the court in Mascat took place the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to jail and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both found among others because of the disorder of public order, "misuse of the internet" and "excavation of the State of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj was sentenced to three-year prison terms and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). furthermore, a one-year ban against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars), after making use of "an information grids for the distribution of material which could be a risk for public order" was found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2569">On 22 August 2016, Al-Abri's deposit was set up on 22 August 2016 and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri's appeal hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to a year and Al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 following the prison of his six-month jail sentence from the central prison in Mascat. al-Haj continues in prison, where he served his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also emphasised the decision of the Ministry of Culture to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the court, Azamn, the newspaper sees itself exposed to attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information received a statement with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Information minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and thus issued a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court, announced the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren't the only cases where freedom of press was injured in Oman at the youngest time.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For further injuries, for example, the closure of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, will include their operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuous closure of Azamn and the detention of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression of the omani authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally release unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect freedom of press in the country, and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. in all circumstances to ensure that human rights and journalists in Oman had impeded their rightful human rights work and without fear of retaliatory measures, including geriatorial shots.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area, one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research, there are two reasons: for example, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more graven effects in the poorest countries of Africa than anywhere else, and lack investment to research these illnesses caused by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research that is carried out by African scientists itself will help establish its own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be instrumental in the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for Exploration of Infection Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself forged himself to the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Zambian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private owner).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the emphasis on my work is on the application of research results. I support the Zambian National Program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just launch a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current scientific themes in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always keep the recipient instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to utilize it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs lots of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, starting at every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of the world, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across Western countries, based on your experiences?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the default approach to scientific expertise, which represent challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the United States to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been working on the salad for the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA-astronaut in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only placed by his own accident and the question, how many types of salads can get there limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads was patented and that he could not continue to be used for breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only suitable for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been registered to more plants such as cereals, or cartridges. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security concerns the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still hides his salad, however, he now needs longer, because his work is still growing steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is as if a rock should lie in a river, in order to paddle me.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents are going to go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before a court, no one can breed more of a new Salad variety, because all features are already patented. "he is doing so good as possible and tried to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavored to use any material which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is always greater in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeders).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronaut of the international space station ISS have bred red redness of the variety of redredna in the "greenhouse." the station is cultivated and eaten. there it is tested if plants can be grown into space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not a coincidence that this name sounds like that, as the motion would come from the IT sector and not from the plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to inspire the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was set up in life to ensure that some plant species and gene must not be protected as intellectual property and are used for plant breeders permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can undergo that others can freely use seed crops.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others to breed it to breeding so own varieties, and not immediately outgoing out - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant designs.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">In the emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger connections, such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter, or only little by making seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg insists that the "open source" movement can't work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not to buy from ecological agriculture or not. "who is a good, locally and sustainable product development, as it is offered on farms in August and September 2016 should also know that the way of growing crops such as this vegetables is being farmed.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary sovereign's sovereign debt without seed sovereign debt is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative undertake to provide others to keep seed maintenance free of charge. in contrast, your preference is to patented seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Supporters argue that the future of food supplies are at risk, since the natural pool is available, due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights to plant materials that is therefore always restricted, ruruptedly shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the Director of Ossi, worked in her doctoral thesis with the genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all cartels features as intellectual property is protected, so it is not even usable for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet, but experts, like Luby, are suspiciously patented plants such as wheat in even higher style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants become so rare that they may have targeted characteristics - from such that their tastes or their colour improves up to such because, due to them in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents in plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more patents. however, genetic diversity is now more necessary than ever before, since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto indicates that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gender banks and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural department of the United States, the company set up the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">She contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties innovation." "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow once the patent is expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often, these instructions help others to get the same result as the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovation, but it encourages how to make public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees what is different: 20 years for waiting until a patent may be done, certainly does not favorably any innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if we have to wait for such a long time to breed in plants, which are adapted to the environmental conditions, one would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general well and still should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">That is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we continue to use the best and newest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferon with the concept to patented plant features: "we don't really create the characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants, they form themselves, and as breeders, ultimately, have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who empowers a variety, also interpreters its own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are required for their growing herbicides, breaching in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is precisely overwhelmed. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized businesses (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, it is the most smaller seed companies, even without having to survive - either they reject this patented or maintain it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">In his breeding garden, the independent plant builder Frank Morton looks like salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders through avoiding plant patented innovative would: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years, "he says." with a patent you are protected for 20 years ahead of competition, with which in my opinion it makes quite nice easy. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept spread rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture") is characterised by itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources that collaborates in the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties, which satisfy certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports her to come to "open source" seed-seeds and to sell its own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol operates at an open source 'licence which ultimately defines a formal and legally binding form of Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeders differ from land to land, so if the Ossi obligation is not simply to be one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventional cultured plants should not be patentable. thus, it is directed against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents for conventional cultured plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not a law yet; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch Organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed companies and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from whole East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and global trend towards the orientation of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for "Open Source" seed systems for "Open Source" seed systems declared that the organization will currently build a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems for scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid agency USC Canada, and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity around the Seed Map Project, a seed map, to publish.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a consortium of aid organisations like the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - represent the opinion that farmers have to come to seed, to exchange and improve the seed policy and ensure a stable supply of food safety.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In this report the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection, by the Luby von Ossi hopes that soon more people will be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement of regional and ecological foods has been respected in particular, where and how much is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," so Luby. "we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Principal Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), human rights abuses in Egypt, as well as the Arab world and reported over.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Principal Network for Human Rights Information remains btful - despite this attack and mocking of the Egyptian right and the constitution in the Arab world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all the technical possibilities had to be exhausted, and not to admit the blocking. we hope to continue our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored page of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic language edition of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of side lock to victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabian language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI there is no access in Egypt's blog of the columnists and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spreading of columnists and articles that he did not access in Egypt's accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up in order to circumvent the Zensurgery of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziadas blog is home, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video as police officers put on physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada was expressed in the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The to lock blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be more important to the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) We managed to convey the feeling of an uprising; an arrest, an attempted murder, unloading of the national Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I didn't write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after having locked him, and that they are afraid of words, I can always change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Much go the way to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) locked Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this revealed technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalate.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers to be made using internet censorship and private surfing, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we realized how the locking of websites, the VPNs, started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests the intention of government to block content and filtering content, which might have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation will also exacerbated that the censors decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction, by which they can act on trial against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">Fight the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army was used in the favela housing in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo of: estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day for day, newspapers in Brazil have made headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school," "every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro will be killed," President Temers sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air missiles to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">The violence in the middle of the economic crisis and in a close-tention financial situation reached the highest status in 2017 in Rio the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian Non-Governmental Organisation Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>

<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world, such as murder, robbery, sexual offence, etc. everything, however, is published by the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio" (...) This is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that as journalists do not close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, Chief Editor of the Newspaper, declared that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war-brik in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist noted that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 areas, there are some of which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial the newspaper writes further:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and her partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the name "War" more than it is profitable?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argued against the violence as "war." this is because of their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to discuss responsibilities at the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as Extra is shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio themselves - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-countering neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the State of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent site in Brazil," according to Cecília, is wrong: "22 out of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are in the north and North east of the country. these are the latest information available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No such cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">If we have to view the murders per Federal state, Rio is at No. 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, emphasised as Cecília, has repeatedly been repeating its security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">In addition to this security policy measures, the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit formed by the state of Rio in 2003, aims to conquer a major police officers to conquer a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this did actually lead to a decrease of nonviolent deaths. since a couple of years ago, the UPP took part over Schikanas and repression against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the term "civil war" by the Geneva Convention.</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also attracts serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state to use funds and ways which are typical for a war. the entry into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp spot in the countryside and an object for "collateralment" and "sphered balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the favela housing in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now that the police reach the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho clomm to prevent death of a police officer.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence also this incident made headlines: a fruit smoker died due to shots, which had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, located in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir ez and Idlib currently around a million Syrians in a state of the siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Particularly strong is the East Ghouta region, where an attack involving chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 resulted in the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, those of the rebels controlled territories outside of Damascus had stood under siege, which led to citizens to be taken on local or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By the years of blockage, traditional food agents such as meat have become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As counteract, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid workers and academics represent the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own fungi as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnear and lead the project together with the Al Adala's NGO.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi does not belong to the traditional, in Syria, and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, it makes its food to an attractive food source for many people in the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Maikel Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because it can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to declare this project and squeezed his relief, that there is now more and more "awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alas the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to plant 125 families of plants to grow mushrooms, so Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they have reached over 100% of the expected target of around 12,700 million, but will continue to collect donations on CanDo by Monday, September 4th, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, the fuel will be used in plastic, to supply the generators to supply the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started working with the "Produktion from the regions of Medjugorje," before they tested their quality, and they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this result, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months, it is distributed anywhere in East Ghouta free.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila declared that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"we want to teach human fungus from different reasons": fraction of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2825">Providing a new food source on the market.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Spread a culture of self catering, by relics (such as paper, tea, coffee set, cardboard, etc) to profit new foods.</seg>

<seg id="2829">He said, "We hope to spread this idea in the whole world, so our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 financial crisis</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protestated on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and called justice for the victims of fires that rampaged in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this resulted in the fact that the government proclaimed the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galizien region of Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire bursts that spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in Pedrógão Grande was a similar tragedy, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to European forest management system, the forest areas were supervised by satellite photos alone in Portugal only 500,000 hectares of forest have been burnt down in Portugal - an area of the magnitude of Lisbon.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The seeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The goal of protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting forces by the State.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why the civil protection was not capable of combing the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">They did this Sunday, somewhere: there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would happen again in June, because the streets were very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, construction permits are injoyed in ointarities with high Brandrisiko.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A wide proposal on the Walloform, which the government had brought after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the municipalities that the new rules saw as obstacle for investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government led a loosening of the law that allowed the construction activity of the case, if the applicant could be an open door, so that everything could be built," by João Sorval is continuing in the same article of the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus made it clear that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of light fireable wood, as far as in a vicious circle, as far as in a vicious circle.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal is on 15 and 16 October, when residents were seeking information or attempted to contact the nationals.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: it used its own civil protection data using the Fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by developers João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so decisive for this fateful weekend in October so that the server followed the onslaught of 400,000 users, which followed fires, did not exceed the site more than half a million.</seg>

<seg id="2873">During a night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a devastating war broke out between the different mujahedin groupings which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at that time, Asharaf Barati was a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in Ghazni province in Central Afghan for the last time with his family at supper.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say so then, she knew her son would not see her son a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and kill him.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezara-e-Wahdat leaders were murdered just by the Taliban, and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban is getting closer to the Hazara-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Several days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohort. work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and sluggishly sacks with mortars, who were heavier than he himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" he remembered an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we worked as well.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung a nylon in front of the open windows that we can't afford at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">After the dangerous journey along the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek government had rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day to food in needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for asylum seekers in Italy. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers find asylum seekers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The civil society of Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special admission centers. it is an improvised equipment in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording centre, when they officially filed an application for asylum - which can be sent after the registration of asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="2901">By then there are people who have no money for accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it succeeds also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his self-handed life helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years working in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf mocked his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel, and a snugs.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis Success Story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind the Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, for the 24 time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, 20.000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of our companies were created, including cutting sites, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of the Orient Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is narrated by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes - the history of their journey to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghanistan.</seg>
