that is James R@@ isen .
you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in New York Times reporter .
long before each one heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen was a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA report@@ edly heard illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans .
however , it is another chapter , which should leave a permanent impression .
therein , it describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally stran@@ ded in Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know whom the chapter wasn &apos;t pleased ?
the US Government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became the symbol for the Pat@@ tern of the Government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , to defeat journalists and journalists .
according to First Constitu@@ tions , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they can not protect the identity of the Mu@@ an@@ tigen that they will give .
so when the government le@@ ased with R@@ isen , he did something what many cour@@ age@@ ous reporter had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was still living with the risk of going into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , even though they were pro@@ longed for years that it was essential for their case , the demands of the government of R@@ isen was dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources are always hiding .
instead of failure and inst@@ ants to make statements , that too might do his digital Foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , got rid of his phone numbers ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its lending service , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and cra@@ ck source , to condemn .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , Justice has more condemned than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we set the press work on the game , which is supposed to be protected by the first Constitutional device , because the government has more opportunities to sp@@ read@@ out all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can take this from the moment in which they contact us , rather than in the night , in the witness stand .
today , there are communications software , which had not yet been written when R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transition system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet famous , which was developed by us by Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents to upload , or send documents , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server which only has the local news agency access .
so the government can no longer need more information , and many of the information that would request it would be not available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies all of us .
it is important to us that not just the technology denom@@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility of bringing ini@@ quities . it is equally important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers must report a modest and over@@ crowded hospital . or the next environmental workers , the alarm will strike the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover their crimes , but to protect our entire constitutional rights .
thanks . thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the greatest Daten@@ le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous fin@@ es are hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; What does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to a Declaration . &#93; This week we were invited by news about a l@@ apping of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s resident law office fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks , and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ o fon@@ sec@@ a , saying : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad letters ro@@ oted in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting in the next release , and to the next reve@@ aling documents .
it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ ROM .
it seems to weep from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing the media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few steps to hide and waste their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work .
I always present it like a Mat@@ ry@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now , it is not so that there is no rich Americans that are hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases .
but through the principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ases work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a database of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need to pay less information in some US states , in order to start a company than to obtain a library identity card .
this kind of in@@ transparent in the USA has allowed employees to depart from school districts .
it has allowed Bet@@ ting to move , especially vulner@@ able an@@ gled .
it is this type of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself up as a African minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked us that everybody was looking for a lawyer our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . no one of these lawyers received us as clients , and of course , nobody was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer , who informed our investig@@ ator &apos;s proposals .
it &apos;s not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ oner , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
that may sound all very comfor@@ ting , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing would have changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist , I see quite what has begun to change .
over the past couple of years , we have seen advantages to more transparency , which affects the owners of companies .
the topic was political atten@@ ti@@ veness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been captured in central banks at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill into two parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used to worry about in the USA and globally for more transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lights .
we need managers in the economy that rise up and say : &quot; in@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end through laws this type of in@@ transparent .
together , we can finally end that kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering can finally end .
this is the story , how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him into a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just never met him ! he says he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
that is a small trunk !
then I heard me say : &quot; I have an air lock . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I moved to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I rock@@ ed with me ?
a wild sleeping sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s going crazy ? &quot;
I got such fear that I went out of the bed , on the flip @-@ pointed at the door , and my sleeping door closed .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me is now in his class@@ room . he is a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view angle .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood , were friends who were only waiting for waiting to be discovered ?
to lodge in my air sk@@ etch , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air@@ bed .
we make a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ad , attracts my ro@@ omm@@ ates and rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
I think creativity is able to create fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new Mit@@ bewohner Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment is available at a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; Luft@@ mat@@ r@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure , our cheese and ham ch@@ ops tasted completely different , because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we adopted our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came in rolls .
my former fellow student , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out , if one could make it a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we would like to create a site , at which people post public images from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
via the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket was fired .
but they did not .
nobody , who is yet completely in consol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we all learned as children , foreign lands are dangerous .
when you have a problem , one has the things that can be good . we were designed to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we learned how to construct objects , but now we wanted to create by design imm@@ enses , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with confidence ?
I want to give you a taste , which degree of confidence we stri@@ ked .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to leave you un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the door first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the lock@@ able of a foreig@@ ner in your hands ?
the majority feel the responsibility .
so also the most guests feel when you stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell ?
could you please tell Twitter that he is di@@ vest@@ ed for the President of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
they have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented even with his name , if he would have told where he comes , like his dog or his children ?
imagine that you would have 150 ass@@ essments , who say all : &quot; he can really hold very good un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
for a well @-@ consistent feedback system , confidence is crucial .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to keep negative complaints .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest appearances , before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how much they are related to age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
that is a natural social pre@@ ference .
exciting it is exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
when one has less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation does simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we discovered that trust is dependent on how much you are reas@@ onably priced .
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
when you &apos;re talking too little , just like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get a response .
tells you too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted .
so there is an optimum degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; olle works in your apartment ! I am with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create design , create this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which themes you should write .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces to strangers .
with which we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ locate these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
firstly : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : as a need , which had not been covered before .
we &apos;re running the business very well for us .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smooth .
there were guests who have been invited to celebrate parties or homes .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly on my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it is hurt if I only think of it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve us .
luck@@ ily of the 123 million nights , only a fraction is ever a problem .
because people trust one to another .
when confidence works , the miracle can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who tend through sitting activities to heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that save one life , even though they do not know an even right .
they drive one in their own car , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
they let even stay longer without charge extra nights .
I recommend it highly ! &quot;
this is , of course , not every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon the term for the first time , I asked :
how does the idea of part with monetary transactions fit together ?
it is a economic trade here .
but it simply can call &quot; rental industry &quot; now , the thing will not be justified .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people make a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if one is travelling nowadays , it is possible to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but rather authentic .
what would be , however , if traveling is a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited one group there would wait to fill a group there and to show a bar in a ta@@ vern@@ our neighborhood , of which one has never heard .
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy .
what would be , if we would like to make homes of land ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the minds of joint divi@@ den@@ ds ?
I imagine cities that allow us to provide society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ priv@@ ation .
in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered to residents , who were looking for a stay in search of a stay ,
were convey@@ ed in people whose children were exp@@ elled ; In@@ cub@@ ator programmes were launched ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , about 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in 191 countries by a foreig@@ ner or even host .
the idea seems to be so crazy , as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was also already there .
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work exactly ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with confidence of confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep @-@ root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find that astonishing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da is over to me .
of course , we don &apos;t know that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but when it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can benefit from design .
thanks . thank you .
what do you think if you view me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a cereb@@ ral la@@ under@@ wear , a terror ?
or just a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you guilt for your negative impressions .
this is how the media people represent what I look like .
a study found that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think that most of them would not know Muslims .
probably the people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never learned to know Muslims : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee table -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ ous @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ cian ,
and I &apos;m a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , Baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to go .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homos@@ exual person , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot;
the ru@@ sty was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 years old , I felt a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I didn &apos;t just assume the faith of my parents .
I have the Koran .
I read it , thinking about , asked in question , doub@@ ted , and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dev@@ otion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself . I feel that God knows me .
had you ever felt that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you completely understand , and somehow he loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started like all good Egyptians , my career as engineer .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot;
then the terrible morning was coming in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had an end to the screen , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ feedback . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , men spl@@ itted from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly into indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim &quot; terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; &#91; ... &#93; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country attacked , but in N@@ u transformed the works of others from a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the US West in order to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we left -- when we went to silence -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be known as Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , when I heard , I read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d auti@@ ously , &quot; &quot; lead in well @-@ lighted oppos@@ ing , &quot; &quot; uph@@ um@@ bles you not . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims should gather for prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who had held for Muslims , and defeated free .
there were really bran@@ ching on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who had attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I have turned the rage of people on the terrorists .
ask yourself ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain to itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
it just raises the question : are we v@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor is just under observation .
alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all the other Americans , no tum@@ ors in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thanks ! thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , s@@ ut@@ ors and Olympi@@ ad .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there will be some parking lots , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other faith toler@@ ant , and show greater citizen participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process it has been noted that it begins to be online . as the first person to do the person from their family , that the person believes that the terrorists may have the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour and their ide@@ ology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
in the end , a group of the IS explains its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as the Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their premises , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks ! thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but when you throw a look on it , they don &apos;t drive what they v@@ ases in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the Scrip@@ tures .
a remarkable Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing history :
a girl came to him , because she had fore@@ seen the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . everyone spiritual , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense for in@@ justice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
from nothing insp@@ ires and something that would have given their anger , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m presented the connection to God and their church .
rather than acc@@ use it for their rage , he demonstrated its construc@@ tive approach for a real change in the world .
as learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia belong to me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day rely on our democracy , on our freedom of mind ?
one study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic studies -- show : if we fear ourselves , there will happen at least three things .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
one study shows : when people submit to individuals , in which negative via Muslims were reported , they have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims were shot dead -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never related to terrorist attacks .
it was in the heart of the Iraq war and during two periods of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public to balance the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as first , but the toxic air of fear falls all of us .
with the assignment of collective intelligence , it is not only about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was promising in dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person they knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is there such a young man from my breasts ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne &apos;s visit with her brother and his wife she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after his remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so go back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque ? we stayed safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America would like to leave our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one in which we can freely choose our religion .
we decided to go for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we left in silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and drew off my shoes , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me hold on .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m did an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , because half of the assembled Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to join us .
in this moment , I am collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what are you going to choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go to number safe ?
or will you connect to them that mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what you say that you may say that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a den@@ ician with deep @-@ pass , in a noble thought @-@ factory , is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive . I am completely normal .
I am no exception to this .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
if one looks at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever performed study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want labour and they want to live in peace .
so , I &apos;m no exception in any respect .
if people usually appear as a rule , often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception of the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , stands in front of a billi@@ on@@ aire store .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . it is possible in research establishments worldwide .
before air p@@ ups in our social awareness has entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting els , air@@ crafts reach high speed and acceleration on tight space .
you can also build self @-@ resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
you have lear@@ nt to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ences and to act generally on natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to pass the boundaries of the possible flight .
so that a system operates autonomous , it is necessary to know that in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each air machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
there are external commands at the highest standards , for example , &quot; launch &quot; and &quot; landing . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called hed@@ ging starter ,
one flight unit , which tries to strike two flying with a fla@@ p .
like other Star@@ r@@ ut@@ ters it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most Star@@ r@@ ut@@ ters , it can wave and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping site .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ es is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence and wind b@@ anners .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position can obtain optimum position and improve performance by practic@@ ing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask the basic abstract questions that would enter the heart of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that are joined together to viol@@ ate you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote control units that had just two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate .
recently we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically @-@ sim@@ ulated flight unit . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ ders , no further actu@@ ators or control buttons , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the inner life , so it can be stable and can move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability to throw it exactly right if everyone looks , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ Cou@@ pler with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is very symmet@@ rical .
this is why it is equivalent in its alignment .
thereby he receives the au@@ r@@ ential capacity ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is evident in models , the rest is learned directly at flying .
let &apos;s see that .
if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this revol@@ ves around clock@@ wise .
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falling out , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate that we are making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic pigs .
large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a pal@@ let in aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weights less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would be an flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology .
for types such as we are the salary in the development and the career act .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever ones to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential , is the t@@ ittle of the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes have always changed rapidly in a very far distant galaxy , so the mass of three sh@@ uns in a ten@@ ths is pure energy .
for this short moment , they ligh@@ tened more brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the universe .
it was a very big pop .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time secret itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events in the first time .
1.3 billion years ago , there was just a majority shar@@ pen@@ al life on the earth .
since then Earth has brought a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God arise -- even the Internet .
some 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss , MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech - decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ stic black holes .
the majority held them crazy .
but enough people recognized they as mad gen@@ ius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ res gra@@ vit@@ ation of the observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly increase what the detection performance improved enorm@@ ously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , obst@@ inate problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes were through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hugh@@ es : two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell of my death @-@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hugh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observations such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ abling in the scope of space and time .
when over@@ hau@@ led the wave , the space and its entire content will be stretched into a direction and put into the other .
to illustr@@ ate , lec@@ turers perform in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often a real al@@ ber@@ ty dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on September 14 , for example , everybody was stretched and conf@@ au@@ ded by us when lifting the waves . the strain of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 N@@ ul@@ ls after the company , followed by a 1 . therefore , the Lig@@ o employees declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of a nuclear war . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text by Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties when construction of such det@@ ectors are massive .
but physi@@ cist , physi@@ cist and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott ref@@ utes , Lig@@ o is more than an ear as an eye .
I would like to explain what that signi@@ fies .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite convenient . because so you can make a picture or a card of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving that by several points of common light around you .
at sounds it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wave length of up to 15 meters .
so it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that offer you very much :
the face of your child .
instead we l@@ ur@@ red according to certain characteristics such as pitch and level , rhythm , and volume to close to the history behind it .
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can make no simple images of objects in all .
but considering changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so , if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can &apos;t listen to all that literally .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about much about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an extra sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a sort of movement of motion , expressed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I &apos;ve never forgotten -- heard : &#91; Sur@@ render des &#93; J@@ one who knows what he must hear that this is as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass which turns around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : if we think we are just what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 S@@ uns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein , the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way , we can listen to the universe and the un@@ seen .
we can &apos;t see much in all -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the All .
the thr@@ illing physically processes happen in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see , because these op@@ aque are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation perme@@ ate iron , as if it would like transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the ur@@ anium is hidden by his own after@@ shine .
through gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to back to the beginning .
and that &apos;s most important : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we &apos;ve never seen , which we &apos;ve never seen , and from which we don &apos;t have any idea , we can only discover that we listen .
in fact Lig@@ o was in the first start of the start which we did not expect .
my colleague am MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o showed us a completely different perspective on the events of all , in the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the r@@ ushing and the pen of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a brand new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than listen to the cre@@ eping thing itself ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks . thank you .
some time I tried an experiment .
for a year I would say &quot; Yes ! , &quot; before I was afraid .
no matter if it made me nervous , I brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I was forced to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I ever wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I begin to play with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : that what to do , when I was afraid , felt my fear .
my fear , talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected art . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for un@@ explained reasons . &quot;
it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; my k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
she once asked me whether I could play with her , when I was just at the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I am going to play with them , always with them when you &apos;re going to answer me . no matter what I just do , or wherever I go , I say always yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I feel very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; was going to play my career with my children .
I have a true dream job .
I am the author . I think about things , consider life .
dream job .
no . no .
I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I use television .
I am on TV , in large style .
in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV channels , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are at the same time .
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for a TV account can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars on TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , simultaneously in production , time four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my TV series run one another on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV @-@ hours are programs that I have created myself and not only produced , so still ob@@ sc@@ ended . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans of camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this yet ?
no one , why am I a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you speak a company , a country or a class@@ room , take me a business or a class@@ room , so you know that I am not just lying around the computer , and it &apos;s true , if I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream in a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ ens the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land from nothing .
it is as I set up troops , as a painting I paint on canvas .
as a dre@@ ad man , a marathon delivered to a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is sum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it is growing and growing , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever .
many people assume , if I explain them the sum@@ s that I speak about writing that writing may be glad to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the Sum@@ ms -- when I started working with TV production began when I started working and work to work , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the tot@@ als is action and activity . the tot@@ als is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the Sum@@ men is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , you can not stri@@ ve differently than in size .
the feeling , do not feel differently than to stri@@ ve , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ ms .
or maybe it also meant to be a workshop .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
maybe it is ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make it clear : the more successful I will , the more shows , the more episodes , the longer winter there are , the more the more work , the more the more I write , the more I write about history , the more expectations it gives .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , isn &apos;t it ?
the land which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
rev@@ amped , over@@ claimed , ex@@ agger@@ ated , extended .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that her mom is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um is not there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; S@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
there are the children of a titanium box .
they are baby @-@ titanium .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s stopped .
the tot@@ als of the engine was silent .
I loved my work no more . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium box work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekend , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan &apos;s not , does not exist , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV channels , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV @-@ programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ show ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the Sum@@ ms and the Sum@@ ms I was .
so what makes you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some of them think : &quot; Heu@@ l out , &quot; the author of Titan . &quot;
but you know , you &apos;re doing it , you are working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker who knows how to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker who knows how to feel the sum@@ s , and knows how the sum@@ s knew already when the sum@@ s stop , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart hear , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ alist &quot; asks me a question .
I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I will say no , I will be aware of two things :
firstly , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t give me a k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I owe it to Titan bin and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes to my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we are playing and their sisters stum@@ ble , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and absence of mar@@ gins , I can do nothing out of it .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are stick@@ y finger and wet k@@ isses , delicate voices , wa@@ xes and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl is in &quot; The Ice Cream . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short , that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and this is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like being a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we forgot .
the sum@@ s , the work environment , the titanium ens@@ ms , that is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I say to you who I am , if I describe myself using programs and television lessons , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the tot@@ als is no strength , and it is not jo@@ bless .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sum is depends on love .
the tot@@ als is the current that comes from lust .
the real Sum@@ men is Self @-@ Con@@ sci@@ ousness and Peace .
the real sum igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are to be the blast , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
the real sum is simple and original .
the real sum of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ per@@ ed me God &apos;s false words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this as a firm rule , so that I can free me as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no choice . I don &apos;t have any choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
games do not play an@@ ew , how to work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer the workplace as home .
this confession is painful , because what a human being is more than to be home ?
well yes , me .
let &apos;s be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too sensitive , none of them .
we look around in the garden , before and back .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we grin@@ d soap bub@@ bles .
I feel predominantly stiff , absent and confused .
I always feel like my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the sum of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ?
you can also ! let them always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you stay for n@@ ai@@ v , for a meeting woman .
you &apos;re right there , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they seem to make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
and speak my te@@ ens &apos; daughter for 15 minutes long with me , am I mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs not .
each can get 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood day !
15 minutes away !
no cell phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to make .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my feel @-@ feeling , my world . it must not be the children . it is true that sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul of soul .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m g@@ ere and I won . friends meet , books read the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why do not indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the tot@@ als came back in my spare time . the Sum@@ ms seems to return when I am not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opening up and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it meets me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the Sum@@ ms , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum@@ s now .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s me that I &apos;m a Titan bin . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan to play the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet , I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ m@@ ess , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling in me is wide . less Titan - more I !
the more I feel this tot@@ als , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think about things , I wake up to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live its dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little bo@@ omer@@ ang .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; too much work and to play more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how to change your life from a second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us , neuro@@ surgeon is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability to help themselves .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have lasting , serious han@@ dicap .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures .
certainly they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; low @-@ depth stim@@ ulation . &quot; I im@@ planted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which led by heavy trem@@ ors and heavy pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with little help , the brain can help themselves .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was conducting senior physician and worked in the emergency response day and night .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that when the brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a is w@@ illed and incl@@ ined by the skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a .
in order to save life , one must decrease cran@@ ial pressure .
you sometimes have to remove a part of melted brain mass .
instead of having s@@ wollen cereb@@ ral weight , we decided to do with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist who analyse the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is no easy task .
however , grow from a tissues , comparable to small children who are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts he made Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you know from the biology class that stem cells are in@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small zer@@ oes of brain .
it is surprising to obtain that kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells deterior@@ ated differently .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
we therefore saw a new , strange nu@@ b population that looked like stem cells , but was different .
we needed long to understand whence they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide the folding of the brain .
but why are they staying for us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but that is not so certain .
however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , allowing brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they then mark coloured , to track them in the brain .
during the last step we im@@ planted them at the exception of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in bra@@ zing brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken away after a few weeks , they were taken away back home . the room is already busy , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added a violation and impl@@ antation exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- it grew to ri@@ pen neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells which we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture .
here , of course , we could not stop .
are these cells helping to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkey with a manual sk@@ ill@@ ful task .
you had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we did the motor @-@ motor range in the motor @-@ motor range .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
exactly as it would happen to humans , they recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like after stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . it rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree , just as at the apes .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the monkeys that recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial output from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , when we im@@ planted the cells , the same monkey , two months after the m@@ pl@@ antation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found much more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use them .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still , to im@@ press it in people .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives you the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need this . &quot;
I definitely need .
of course , the question is what the largest obstacles are before you can start Clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the largest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : looking into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you look forward to the future , how many years it will take until someone comes to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will it allow us the authority to launch it soon ?
then one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients who choose treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
afterwards one has to apply this to a multi @-@ center study .
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thanks a lot .
democracy .
in the West , we make a big mistake , of course , to consider .
we do not see democracy than the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable qualities .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leading democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great night in Beijing have definitely proved that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely democr@@ atically .
in fact , democracy is overcome with us in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I re@@ signed Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - cannot affect the austerity programs that were reality in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my infl@@ ated friends who would repeat me if it would change anything .
at this point I want to introduce an economical model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without democracy our companies are common , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are w@@ asted .
regarding the subject of wast@@ age , I would like to as@@ sign you to an interesting conflict that is currently threatened by our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin peaks &quot; parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the D@@ ebt berg , who th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all realize the debt of debt ,
but few are recogni@@ zable by his dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the ver@@ itable austerity and Concert , however , to invest it there would be productive and income , with which one could produce productive , and also all the things which humanity is ur@@ gently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 billion US Dollar res@@ emble a lot of money until it equ@@ ates to $ 5.1 trillion , which at the same time spent around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to did , except for the ex@@ changes and real estate prices .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital represent the twin peaks that do not balance through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the United States , Japan and Europe alone , and therefore promote low mac@@ ro@@ economic demand , which could not invest in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , which could be true that his son would kill him when he is growing ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally the circumstances suggest that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
his most remarkable art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for saving the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we continued : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally finished too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the priority of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these connections .
the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they entered the working poor and not only gave the right to free expression of expression , but more important and crucial , which they gave them the right to political participation in question of the state siege .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not keep long kept --
like a candle which sh@@ ines very light , it is also burned quickly .
however , our today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the US Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process on politics was imposed , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democr@@ atically @-@ democr@@ atically zone was granted .
in our present @-@ time demo@@ cra@@ cies since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ eff@@ able struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually mig@@ rated to politics and dis@@ ma@@ stered them .
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are not like earlier ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is about that one cannot be in the government nowadays , and nevertheless not in power because power is mig@@ rated by politics into the economy and the areas separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ ders with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous animals , which so sustain@@ s the animals , from which it feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , that it is therefore star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that the policy is so far kan@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is increasing , the economic demand is falling and the managing director of the companies are contrac@@ ted to invest the cash of their enterprises .
the successful attempt to exp@@ el the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour and the wealth of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; reserves control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the mar@@ x@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age .
but there is a solution : to do the working poor !
capitalism does it , by replacing low pay@@ outs through automation and robot .
the problem is , as long economy and policies are separated , lets the automation the twin peaks are higher , the waste disposal , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
thus , we must re@@ structure the economy and re@@ uni@@ fy the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we can democr@@ atically shape the re @-@ arranged area , otherwise we will appear in a path@@ ological monitoring of hyper@@ auto scan , which can appear the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , whether capitalism has caused the technical achievements , which he will survive .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; Matrix &quot; which resem@@ bles human beings , and to put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it need to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like this utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to call you shortly , in all few examples .
in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market where you are earned and in which your capital gains you from a workplace to the next , by a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who work currently in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between them that belong to the company , but they do not work therein , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong here . no exchange between capital and labor , no large g@@ aps between investment and austerity , and ultimately , no more empi@@ rical twin summit .
in the area of global political economy : please make sure that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in interest of all mankind .
imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government paying the sum to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment resources are rare .
this is not a new idea .
this is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they have been privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we be awak@@ ening in such a world
or will we drop in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do better democratic .
thanks . thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you specify yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ orial Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have said just said is Marx relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we do that , the technological development can generate such a massive decline in mac@@ ro@@ economic demand , what Larry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ ent Marx@@ ist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely enter@@ tained .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think that .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , who told us . BG said : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of Red@@ ner you have very clearly said what you keep from the point of view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the sign of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy in politics , during the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democr@@ ati@@ ent zone .
in certain ways , when I must say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative it is similar to China today in the England of the 19th century .
for -- Do you remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically thinking .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly sk@@ ep@@ tical , regarding democratic development .
what we can see now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to second .
China now acc@@ uses to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half @-@ year later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the suicide rate , the constant den@@ ial that ran a massive rise in the euro zone , and continues to massi@@ vely threatened the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was revealed to this den@@ ial --
we have to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to obtain an economic system that is not totally viable , can be saved through political will and auth@@ orization of life , it might be delayed any time , but if the change occurs , it is ab@@ rupt and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future , if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back --
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who was in office after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
naturally I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake had to sign the application for extension of the cancellation program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the bank of the money , finding a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the examinations carried out by the Eurozone .
they did not admit that they have been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , who has imposed on this policy , was stressed : &quot; this was a col@@ onic mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all that , despite the aggressive behavior of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , opposite anyone who lives and loves Europe .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone doesn &apos;t survive .
for if they ha@@ dn &apos;t survived , the dra@@ fted fli@@ ers will be D@@ ä@@ mon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
that will not have been dis@@ astro@@ us for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be as well as for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope so you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , even though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy arrived three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sv@@ elte , has a I@@ gel@@ hair@@ y and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy does not choose any .
he must find shows that are very , very well .
in other words , he must find shows that are located very right on the turn .
this curve is the distribution distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given these assessment .
if your show is valued at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after seeing one season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should say enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I believe you are already a special intelligence , to accommodate &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle compensation , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must ensure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he &apos;s holding a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and shows them online where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon is in vain things , one attacks , right ?
millions of viewers are looking at this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are watching the shows of these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you p@@ aus@@ ing , which parts are ski@@ pped / check again .
you collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process this and the answer is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of that show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many could not remember that show , because it was not so good .
it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this bend is 7.4 and Alpha House also ends up on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time in another company , another manager has group@@ ed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy it is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different .
rather than competing instead of a competition , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they went up and decided not to take a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know that Show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x got a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; House of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very liter@@ acy , data experienced .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is this located ?
because logic somehow says that this should work with all .
when you collec@@ ts millions of data , a decision which you meet , then you should make a good decision .
he has 200 years on statistics as a back @-@ up .
optimized by a very powerful computer .
the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so , then this is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time we find out more and more to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone asks here in the US in prison and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is carried out or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will decide whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . this is not the fact that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data can also be experienced correctly .
yes , even Google is doing mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it is due to data analysis le@@ ak@@ ages of flu , the aw@@ ful kind , fore@@ told -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news conference . the success was culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year by year , until it did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it didn &apos;t work , it was another sensation again , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data can be experienced , like Amazon and Google is sometimes mis@@ understood .
despite all these errors , data circul@@ ates into decisions of life -- at work , in law , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ supported Genetics - an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some pattern on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you ever solve a complex problem , you do mostly do two things :
then put this problem in its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place , set the parts together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and assemble it again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just fine for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how power@@ fully , can only help to destroy a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to comp@@ ose the parts again and then to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , so if the information is incomplete , especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think it was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would have been able to do . but the decision to take all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant she entered a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did it in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices but I think things went wrong , when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or No @-@ question , you only have to shake the ball . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will later press it with a technique of technology .
I have taken some decisions in my life so far , with whom I should hear in the ball .
but , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much wis@@ er , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the structure .
so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er , and wis@@ er . finally , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays to meet decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and to deal with risks .
because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks where you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
