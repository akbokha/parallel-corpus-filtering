<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize in New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before each one heard from Edward Snowden, Risen was a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA reportedly heard illegal telephones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it is another chapter, which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein, it describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally stranded in Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know whom the chapter wasn't pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became the symbol for the Pattern of the Government, Whistleblower, to defeat journalists and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to First Constitutions, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they can not protect the identity of the Muantigen that they will give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government leased with Risen, he did something what many courageous reporter had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen was still living with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, even though they were prolonged for years that it was essential for their case, the demands of the government of Risen was dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources are always hiding.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and instants to make statements, that too might do his digital Footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his agreement, got rid of his phone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its lending service, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and crack source, to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, Justice has more condemned than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work on the game, which is supposed to be protected by the first Constitutional device, because the government has more opportunities to spreadout all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take this from the moment in which they contact us, rather than in the night, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communications software, which had not yet been written when Risen has written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transition system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet famous, which was developed by us by Aaron Swartz, and is today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents to upload, or send documents, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server which only has the local news agency access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer need more information, and many of the information that would request it would be not available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world will always develop new spy technologies all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us that not just the technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have the possibility of bringing iniquities. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of abuse during the supply of soldiers must report a modest and overcrowded hospital. or the next environmental workers, the alarm will strike the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover their crimes, but to protect our entire constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the greatest Datenleck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous fines are hidden in tax havens.] [What does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to a Declaration.] This week we were invited by news about a lapping of 11 million documents in Panama's resident law office fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks, and lawyers go to companies such as Moso fonseca, saying: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad letters rooted in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="49">It claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting in the next release, and to the next revealing documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing the media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few steps to hide and waste their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing this whole world and it's hard to understand how these tax havases work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a Matryjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now, it is not so that there is no rich Americans that are hiding their assets in tax havases.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which this tax havases work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a database of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need to pay less information in some US states, in order to start a company than to obtain a library identity card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparent in the USA has allowed employees to depart from school districts.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed Betting to move, especially vulnerable angled.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself up as a African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everybody was looking for a lawyer our investigator, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. no one of these lawyers received us as clients, and of course, nobody was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who informed our investigator's proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politioner, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound all very comforting, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing would have changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist, I see quite what has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past couple of years, we have seen advantages to more transparency, which affects the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic was political attentiveness by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been captured in central banks at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill into two parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used to worry about in the USA and globally for more transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that rise up and say: "intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end through laws this type of intransparent.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end that kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering can finally end.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, how I almost abducted and in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him into a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">As we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just never met him! he says he would go to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">That is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me say: "I have an air lock. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Ah, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I moved to the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I rocked with me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sleeping sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's going crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I went out of the bed, on the flip-pointed at the door, and my sleeping door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me is now in his classroom. he is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood, were friends who were only waiting for waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To lodge in my air sketch, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the airbed.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plead, attracts my roommates and rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity is able to create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new Mitbewohner Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment is available at a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "Luftmatrze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure, our cheese and ham chops tasted completely different, because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we adopted our last guest and the door to the castle fell, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow student, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out, if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we would like to create a site, at which people post public images from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket was fired.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is yet completely in consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learned as children, foreign lands are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, one has the things that can be good. we were designed to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to construct objects, but now we wanted to create by design immenses, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a taste, which degree of confidence we striked.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to leave you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the lockable of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also the most guests feel when you stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell Twitter that he is divested for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented even with his name, if he would have told where he comes, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 assessments, who say all: "he can really hold very good unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well-consistent feedback system, confidence is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to keep negative complaints.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest appearances, before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how much they are related to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">That is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting it is exciting if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">When one has less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation does similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we discovered that trust is dependent on how much you are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you're talking too little, just like "Hi!," you don't get a response.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tells you too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimum degree of openness, such as "olle works in your apartment! I am with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create design, create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which themes you should write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices to strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dislocate these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: as a need, which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">We're running the business very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been invited to celebrate parties or homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly on my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it is hurt if I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers, and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily of the 123 million nights, only a fraction is ever a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust one to another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, the miracle can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who tend through sitting activities to heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that save one life, even though they do not know an even right.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in their own car, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let even stay longer without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I recommend it highly! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This is, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon the term for the first time, I asked:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of part with monetary transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it simply can call "rental industry" now, the thing will not be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People make a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If one is travelling nowadays, it is possible to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but rather authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, if traveling is a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited one group there would wait to fill a group there and to show a bar in a tavernour neighborhood, of which one has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be, if we would like to make homes of land?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the minds of joint dividends?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us to provide society and relationships, instead of loneliness and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents, who were looking for a stay in search of a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed in people whose children were expelled; Incubator programmes were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, about 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest in 191 countries by a foreigner or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy, as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also already there.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work exactly?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with confidence of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep-root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that astonishing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda is over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we don't know that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But when it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can benefit from design.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you view me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a cerebral launderwear, a terror?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you guilt for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media people represent what I look like.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think that most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never learned to know Muslims: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee table -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealous-fitness-fanatician,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, Baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to go.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you oppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The rusty was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 years old, I felt a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I didn't just assume the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thinking about, asked in question, doubted, and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Had you ever felt that somebody perceives you, you completely understand, and somehow he loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started like all good Egyptians, my career as engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then the terrible morning was coming in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had an end to the screen, looked at the screen and saw the word "Eilfeedback."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, men splitted from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim" terrorists "..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "[...]..." jihad... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked, but in Nu transformed the works of others from a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the US West in order to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we left -- when we went to silence -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be known as Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, when I heard, I read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said: "be vigilant," "Seid autiously," "lead in well-lighted opposing," "uphumbles you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day that Muslims should gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who had held for Muslims, and defeated free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branching on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have turned the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Ask yourself! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we vicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole, and a benign tumor is just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all the other Americans, no tumors in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks! thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, sutors and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be some parking lots, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people of other faith tolerant, and show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, DC told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process it has been noted that it begins to be online. as the first person to do the person from their family, that the person believes that the terrorists may have the true Muslims, and everyone who abhorred their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">In the end, a group of the IS explains its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As the Muslim, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their premises, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks! thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you throw a look on it, they don't drive what they vases in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A remarkable Imam told me recently an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she had foreseen the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. everyone spiritual, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense for injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">From nothing inspires and something that would have given their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accuse it for their rage, he demonstrated its constructive approach for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">As learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia belong to me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day rely on our democracy, on our freedom of mind?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear ourselves, there will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: when people submit to individuals, in which negative via Muslims were reported, they have more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims were shot dead -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never related to terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It was in the heart of the Iraq war and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to balance the foundation of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as first, but the toxic air of fear falls all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective intelligence, it is not only about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was promising in dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me, that he was the sweetest, most generous person they knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is there such a young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne's visit with her brother and his wife she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution after his remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So go back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque? we stayed safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America would like to leave our children: one that would be able to control us through fear, or one in which we can freely choose our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we left in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and drew off my shoes, went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me hold on.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam did an announcement, thanked and called our guests, because half of the assembled Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In this moment, I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you going to choose in the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to them that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say that you may say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a denician with deep-pass, in a noble thought-factory, is an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not deceive. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception to this.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">If one looks at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the biggest ever performed study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want labour and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So, I'm no exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people usually appear as a rule, often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists, stands in front of a billionaire store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drones. it is possible in research establishments worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pups in our social awareness has entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting els, aircrafts reach high speed and acceleration on tight space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learnt to carry loads, to deal with turbulences and to act generally on natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to pass the boundaries of the possible flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system operates autonomous, it is necessary to know that in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">We use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each air machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">There are external commands at the highest standards, for example, "launch" and "landing."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called hedging starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">One flight unit, which tries to strike two flying with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrutters it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most Starrutters, it can wave and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping site.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgees is that they react sensitively to turbulence and wind banners.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter in which position can obtain optimum position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask the basic abstract questions that would enter the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that are joined together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote control units that had just two moving parts: a propeller and a tailgate.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically-simulated flight unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and Querruders, no further actuators or control buttons, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the inner life, so it can be stable and can move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability to throw it exactly right if everyone looks, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the OmniCoupler with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is very symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">This is why it is equivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the aurential capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is evident in models, the rest is learned directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This revolves around clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falling out, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we are making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic pigs.</seg>
<seg id="459">Large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a pallet in aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each individual weights less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would be an flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as we are the salary in the development and the career act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever ones to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential, is the tittle of the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes have always changed rapidly in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three shuns in a tenths is pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lightened more brighter than all the stars together in all the galaxies of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time secret itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in the first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, there was just a majority sharpenal life on the earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then Earth has brought a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God arise -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss, MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gravitation waves, which are caused by collistic black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">The majority held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized they as mad genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometres gravitation of the observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could significantly increase what the detection performance improved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, obstinate problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes were through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he studied gravitational waves from black holes and their observations such as Ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cabling in the scope of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When overhauled the wave, the space and its entire content will be stretched into a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers perform in courses for relativity theory often a real alberty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitation waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, everybody was stretched and confauded by us when lifting the waves. the strain of an average human being was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 Nulls after the company, followed by a 1. therefore, the Ligo employees declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of a nuclear war. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text by Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this: "the technical difficulties when construction of such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist, physicist and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott refutes, Ligo is more than an ear as an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what that signifies.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can make a picture or a card of things by perceiving that by several points of common light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wave length of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">So it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that offer you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we lurred according to certain characteristics such as pitch and level, rhythm, and volume to close to the history behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can make no simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But considering changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So, if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can't listen to all that literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circus with an extra sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement of motion, expressed in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I've never forgotten -- heard: [Surrender des] Jone who knows what he must hear that this is as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass which turns around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: if we think we are just what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 Suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein, the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to the universe and the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in all -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars in supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">The thrilling physically processes happen in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation permeate iron, as if it would like transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the uranium is hidden by his own aftershine.</seg>
<seg id="541">Through gravitation waves, it should be possible to back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that's most important: I am optimistic that in all things we've never seen, which we've never seen, and from which we don't have any idea, we can only discover that we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo was in the first start of the start which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague am MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo showed us a completely different perspective on the events of all, in the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the rushing and the pen of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a brand new generation of observatories on earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listen to the creeping thing itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For a year I would say "Yes!," before I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, I brought me in unpleasant situations, I was forced to say "Yes".</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I ever wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I begin to play with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: that what to do, when I was afraid, felt my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected art. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all "kittens" for unexplained reasons. "</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"my kittens, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me whether I could play with her, when I was just at the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I am going to play with them, always with them when you're going to answer me. no matter what I just do, or wherever I go, I say always yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I feel very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" was going to play my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a true dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think about things, consider life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I use television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am on TV, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season, I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV channels, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a TV account can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars on TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, simultaneously in production, time four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run one another on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV-hours are programs that I have created myself and not only produced, so still obscended. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans of camp fire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, why am I a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you speak a company, a country or a classroom, take me a business or a classroom, so you know that I am not just lying around the computer, and it's true, if I say: I understand that it's not going to dream in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I deepens the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as I set up troops, as a painting I paint on canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dread man, a marathon delivered to a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is summing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it is growing and growing, and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I explain them the sums that I speak about writing that writing may be glad to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Summs -- when I started working with TV production began when I started working and work to work, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totals is action and activity. the totals is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summen is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, you can not strive differently than in size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, do not feel differently than to strive, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summs.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also meant to be a workshop.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I will, the more shows, the more episodes, the longer winter there are, the more the more work, the more the more I write, the more I write about history, the more expectations it gives.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revamped, overclaimed, exaggerated, extended.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum is not there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "Sittens, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a titanium box.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium box work, 15 hours-days, worked weekend, no remorse, nothing delegating, a Titan's not, does not exist, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV channels, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV-programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-show,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the Summs and the Summs I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some of them think: "Heul out," the author of Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you're doing it, you are working to be a teacher, a banker who knows how to be a teacher, a banker who knows how to feel the sums, and knows how the sums knew already when the sums stop, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart hear, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitalist" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm on the way out, late and she says, "Mama, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, I will be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">Firstly, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't give me a kittens. "</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I owe it to Titan bin and my sums, and here everything changes to my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We are playing and their sisters stumble, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and absence of margins, I can do nothing out of it.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky finger and wet kisses, delicate voices, waxes and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl is in "The Ice Cream."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short, that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And this is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like being a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the work environment, the titanium ensms, that is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I say to you who I am, if I describe myself using programs and television lessons, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totals is no strength, and it is not jobless.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals is the current that comes from lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real Summen is Self-Consciousness and Peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sum ignores the pressure of history, which are to be the blast, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sum of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me God's false words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a firm rule, so that I can free me as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I don't have any choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Games do not play anew, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a human being is more than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, me.</seg>
<seg id="728">Let's be honest, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too sensitive, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We look around in the garden, before and back.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We grind soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel predominantly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always feel like my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the sum of the universe fulfills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! let them always say Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you stay for naiv, for a meeting woman.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right there, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they seem to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teens' daughter for 15 minutes long with me, am I mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can get 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad-mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes away!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to make.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feel-feeling, my world. it must not be the children. it is true that sums to feel a place for his soul of soul.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm gere and I won. friends meet, books read the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why do not indulge in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totals came back in my spare time. the Summs seems to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opening up and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it meets me and my soul. it leads me to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the Summs, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me that I'm a Titan bin. I've never seen a Titan to play the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet, I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the totals, the totals, the totals, the totals: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this summess, the more this unusual, consistent, naked and new feeling in me is wide. less Titan - more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this totals, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think about things, I wake up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live its dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That's the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little boomerang.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" too much work and to play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from a second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have lasting, serious handicap.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "low-depth stimulation." I implanted a electrode deeply in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which led by heavy tremors and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With little help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conducting senior physician and worked in the emergency response day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that when the brain-brain traumata is willed and inclined by the skull-brain traumata.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one must decrease cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes have to remove a part of melted brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of having swollen cerebral weight, we decided to do with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist who analyse the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">However, grow from a tissues, comparable to small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts he made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biology class that stem cells are inmature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small zeroes of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain that kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells deteriorated differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We therefore saw a new, strange nub population that looked like stem cells, but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand whence they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they provide the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">However, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, allowing brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark coloured, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">During the last step we implanted them at the exception of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in brazing brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken away after a few weeks, they were taken away back home. the room is already busy, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and implantation exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- it grew to ripen neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells which we dyed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here, of course, we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells helping to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkey with a manual skillful task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we did the motor-motor range in the motor-motor range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen to humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. it recuperate to a certain degree, just as at the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial output from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we implanted the cells, the same monkey, two months after the mplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still, to impress it in people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives you the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely need.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the largest obstacles are before you can start Clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the largest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: looking into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you look forward to the future, how many years it will take until someone comes to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one has to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients who choose treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Afterwards one has to apply this to a multi-center study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we make a big mistake, of course, to consider.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy than the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable qualities.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great night in Beijing have definitely proved that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely democratically.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is overcome with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I resigned Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - cannot affect the austerity programs that were reality in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my inflated friends who would repeat me if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I want to introduce an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy our companies are common, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">Regarding the subject of wastage, I would like to assign you to an interesting conflict that is currently threatened by our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks" paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the Debt berg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all realize the debt of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few are recognizable by his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the veritable austerity and Concert, however, to invest it there would be productive and income, with which one could produce productive, and also all the things which humanity is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion US Dollar resemble a lot of money until it equates to $5.1 trillion, which at the same time spent around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to did, except for the exchanges and real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital represent the twin peaks that do not balance through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the United States, Japan and Europe alone, and therefore promote low macroeconomic demand, which could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus Father, which could be true that his son would kill him when he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally the circumstances suggest that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His most remarkable art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we continued: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally finished too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the priority of Athenian democracy because of these connections.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that they entered the working poor and not only gave the right to free expression of expression, but more important and crucial, which they gave them the right to political participation in question of the state siege.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not keep long kept --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle which shines very light, it is also burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the US Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process on politics was imposed, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratically-democratically zone was granted.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-time democracies since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, an ineffable struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually migrated to politics and dismastered them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are not like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is about that one cannot be in the government nowadays, and nevertheless not in power because power is migrated by politics into the economy and the areas separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Haders with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a flock of carnivorous animals, which so sustains the animals, from which it feeds, decimated, that it is therefore starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that the policy is so far kannibalized, that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is increasing, the economic demand is falling and the managing director of the companies are contracted to invest the cash of their enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="948">The successful attempt to expel the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour and the wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" reserves control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to do the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it, by replacing low payouts through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long economy and policies are separated, lets the automation the twin peaks are higher, the waste disposal, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">Thus, we must restructure the economy and reunify the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we can democratically shape the re-arranged area, otherwise we will appear in a pathological monitoring of hyperauto scan, which can appear the movie "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, whether capitalism has caused the technical achievements, which he will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "Matrix" which resembles human beings, and to put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it need to look like this "Star Trek" like this utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to call you shortly, in all few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce a capital market where you are earned and in which your capital gains you from a workplace to the next, by a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one currently works -- is the property of those who work currently in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between them that belong to the company, but they do not work therein, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong here. no exchange between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately, no more empirical twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please make sure that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging economies], in interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government paying the sum to the trade deficit or the surplus of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment resources are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">This is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, especially in front of the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberally, in which they have been privileged persons, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we be awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop in a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You specify yourself in your biography itself as libertorial Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have said just said is Marx relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... Do we do that, the technological development can generate such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, what Larry Summers referred to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis of one part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, that's why I am a libertent Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am completely entertained.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think that.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, who told us. BG said: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of Redner you have very clearly said what you keep from the point of view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the sign of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited the democracy in politics, during the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratient zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain ways, when I must say that so provocative it is similar to China today in the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- Do you remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically thinking.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, regarding democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now accuses to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half-year later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the suicide rate, the constant denial that ran a massive rise in the euro zone, and continues to massively threatened the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was revealed to this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">We have to do it right. unfortunately, the powers within the euro zone, within the European group, continue to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to obtain an economic system that is not totally viable, can be saved through political will and authorization of life, it might be delayed any time, but if the change occurs, it is abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future, if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back --</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who was in office after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he has no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Naturally I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake had to sign the application for extension of the cancellation program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the bank of the money, finding a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government, only because they did not want to deal with the examinations carried out by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika's Troika, who has imposed on this policy, was stressed: "this was a colonic mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all that, despite the aggressive behavior of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, opposite anyone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone doesn't survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they hadn't survived, the drafted fliers will be Dämonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">That will not have been disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to strike the way of a postmodern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be as well as for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope so you're wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, even though he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy arrived three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, svelte, has a Igelhairy and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy does not choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very well.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located very right on the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the distribution distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given these assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after seeing one season, your brain asks: "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should say enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I believe you are already a special intelligence, to accommodate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle compensation, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he's holding a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of any of these shows and shows them online where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is in vain things, one attacks, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are looking at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are watching the shows of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pausing, which parts are skipped / check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process this and the answer is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four republican US Senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of that show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many could not remember that show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this bend is 7.4 and Alpha House also ends up on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time in another company, another manager has grouped a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy it is always looking for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than competing instead of a competition, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they went up and decided not to take a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know that Show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix got a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"House of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very literacy, data experienced.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this located?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that this should work with all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collects millions of data, a decision which you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">He has 200 years on statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so, then this is a bit frightening because we live in a time we find out more and more to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone asks here in the US in prison and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will decide whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not the fact that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data can also be experienced correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google is doing mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it is due to data analysis leakages of flu, the awful kind, foretold -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news conference. the success was culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year by year, until it did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It didn't work, it was another sensation again, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data can be experienced, like Amazon and Google is sometimes misunderstood.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data circulates into decisions of life -- at work, in law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-supported Genetics - an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some pattern on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever solve a complex problem, you do mostly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">Then put this problem in its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place, set the parts together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and assemble it again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just fine for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerfully, can only help to destroy a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compose the parts again and then to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, so if the information is incomplete, especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think it was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they would have been able to do. but the decision to take all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that doesn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant she entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did it in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices but I think things went wrong, when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or No-question, you only have to shake the ball. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later press it with a technique of technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have taken some decisions in my life so far, with whom I should hear in the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much wiser, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is smarter and wiser, and wiser. finally, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays to meet decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and to deal with risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks where you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
