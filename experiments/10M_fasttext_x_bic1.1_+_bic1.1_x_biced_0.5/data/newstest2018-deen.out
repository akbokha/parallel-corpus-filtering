Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your sight to the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young@@ sters are to meet today .
a grave chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers are farms the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official card coin promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying when landing cards are not up to date .
that knows all that had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow instead of a circum@@ fence .
the historical maps of the digital state of Bavaria , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ a Bayern regional government , are all other than current - yet very reve@@ aling .
especially if you compare it with current online @-@ cards .
it is then clearly , as towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ hah that one can not recognize as such as such .
there were more maps for towns and municipalities in detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ um@@ pet@@ als .
these were developed according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 , and during the first time measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your Client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wish an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria on behalf - of course for military purposes .
although the French troops finally pulled the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 1801 , they were the today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Sur@@ vey@@ ing Administration .
the national team for Munich comes from 1856 , and is , like all , can be found on the website of the Bavarian Authority .
the comparison of the provincial capital is the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was arrested 21 years after the completion of the map , so 1877 , in the Munich district .
today , sub@@ send@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ swar@@ ms are concentrated in 1856 along the castle of Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was only named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the west park is , there is nothing more than fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming appears a smaller component with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; urine , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small plots there are no farmers there today - but small farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is drawn north of sub@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , which had been the scene of the October Revolution , was actually a meadow in the 19th century , and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map shows a gli@@ mp@@ se of the history of psychiat@@ ric medicines .
in the urine sheet , man reads only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig de district of the present district of au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , or at the top height &quot; In the air side , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ street one was once there people with del@@ u@@ sions .
there were in 1858 / 59 the Munich @-@ Munich @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ dition &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment of a psychiat@@ rist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anchor of the so @-@ called Irish .
in addition , he has forbidden the staff to turn violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients , it was first place to be extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the county gate in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East has been one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist .
juven@@ iles on the grounds of former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now meet young people in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and operated him in a youth centre .
located west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; - built in an architectural approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance which had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was &quot; listed &quot; in 1856 , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a crucial change was also in the heart of the Second World War .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs broke out many holes in the inner city center .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses , and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof during that day and on April 5 , 2017 , the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the Schie@@ ber@@ ter you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights publishes it@@ iner@@ ary for Missouri
the National Union to promote sen@@ sel@@ enium has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of State in Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri , which should come into force on August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ians , as a series of question@@ able , racial @-@ based action occur in the entire state and shown here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recent law@@ ed law of Missouri , which makes people harder to gain discrimination , as well as the prosecution authority of the state , aimed at disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate on min@@ orities , said the group , the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have bre@@ aches of the civil rights , the people to pass .
they are painted because of their skin colour , they are crushed or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group cited events such as rac@@ ist negoti@@ ating against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances early of the year , after having no more fuel during the journey through the state and had taken care of the police in custody , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out on a recently published report by the Office of the General Prosecutor &apos;s Office , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will keep 75 percent more common than White .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and know their families , friends and employees , what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be willing to bring it to the Caucas@@ us , or to know his relatives that they travel through the State . &quot;
in 2015 , Missouri reported 100 of hate crimes , following the latest numbers from the FBI &apos;s report program , which puts the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the trip is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to compl@@ ain a company because of residential or employment discrimination .
earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued a travel regulations for Texas and Arizona since the United States agreed to commit local prosecution authority to conce@@ al people because of immigration laws , which will contribute to the subsequent inclusion of AC@@ L@@ U .
they are generally issued by the Ministry of State for other countries , but last time , advoc@@ acy groups have deployed the measure of response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the fisher@@ man &apos;s fisher@@ y Wei@@ gh@@ au@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU committee in Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac are placed in front of a picture .
representatives of the Fis@@ de@@ mann family in the town of Schwen@@ de@@ mann met with Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann opened first insights into his farm where he is cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative market@@ ability for the milk of his cows , so swi@@ vel .
a regional desk will come exclusively on the table of the Feri@@ a .
since he is also a BL@@ HV @-@ chair by Fis@@ bach , he distinguished the course of the &quot; elem@@ ental project . &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep areas .
the green land care for a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have been here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann stressed .
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ dest operation and managed to manage this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ lizers , even if it is not a bi@@ oci@@ dal farm .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy with the leader @-@ funding . &quot;
at a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the request of the areas could still be moved out for a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people working in agriculture , and thoughts on how they continue to carry on their operation , &quot; the mayor faces .
farmers are often in cr@@ iti@@ que of criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open surface area therefore amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be checked until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus , the farmers fall 12 610 , who they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 km of course .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained p@@ anning .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and comp@@ atri@@ ots . &quot;
also Peter White stood up : &quot; the best food products are produced here . &quot;
the regional coun@@ ties ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state funding of pure f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
pre@@ mise is the existence of one of the l@@ p@@ r @-@ drawn convey@@ ors .
in addition , it must not be poor @-@ protected area ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened with the opinion .
this is currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which almost 16 kilometres of fence are planned for the fishing stake in 2018 .
the open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy anymore ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking refuge in the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est character of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as every other - so the car@@ ing of Saddam Hussein &apos;s car@@ ing took place on the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the P@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he received a symbolic ax@@ e in an hot@@ ly dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN over the proposals by the President to dra@@ stic immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty of Liberty would have landed him , if he had done it .
but he grab@@ bed their meaning , and especially the importance that you have been attributed to the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , which was added to its basis .
when Miller receives A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a whole thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem , which you refer to , was added later , and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tual correct , but how he form@@ ulated it , does not really go about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the flo@@ wering words of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your tr@@ ash , your poor , and your oppressed masses who strain themselves free to breathe freely , and the rest of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ty apost@@ asy &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - it clearly shows that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural argument : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , indicating the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this importance : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and they themselves have a quite different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on US N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people wanted to change this far back by the right wing .
the great cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came in , but rather an early new@@ com@@ ics that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving ahead .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not to shine the way in the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception .
the big ph@@ antasy de@@ ed of Lazarus was in it to see how it was seen from the exhau@@ sti@@ ve , but hop@@ eful people after leng@@ thy and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope , and of the will that they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
her tor@@ ch shall not be enligh@@ tened , but hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK
Ei@@ li@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds of a time when only two sh@@ ot@@ tos belonged to the UK team .
the performance director of the ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in world champion &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London in 2017 , starting on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; and the ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand it , and we will continue to find it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the circumstances of the circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ alia - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit while Ei@@ li@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected leader of the team captain .
&quot; Ei@@ li@@ dh is quite modest .
her chapter &quot; speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and genuine feeling that Ei@@ li@@ dh brought completely natural , were magnificent . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner that will compete with its fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 shooting stars in the British team are .
the best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which had been reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle route of Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has installed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part on the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another car@@ rot , one after a great season , which included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cent of her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the man@@ ag@@ erial cap@@ tains says that &quot; enorm@@ ously &quot; in the fact is that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only to the team , but in some cases also the medals and the fin@@ alists will be involved .
&quot; the special thing to be the team captain , is in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me , making it something special for me , &quot; added them .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb for poets .
what my speech in capit@@ als concerned ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public ministry when you cannot bear the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t last long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from the Domestic Policy until its political principles .
he was safe in cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not silence his critics .
because in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , stupid and silent , we will lead the sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to governor Larry H@@ ogan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s staff have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union den@@ ounced him at the beginning of this week .
the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ vol@@ e , and the online comment was full of a return reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type such as H@@ ogan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary he@@ at@@ head .
he has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a pri@@ st@@ ent means to make himself with his voters and de@@ buted to his hair @-@ free brain on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons that come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to as officially , and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse on the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the block@@ age of comments continued nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ing or h@@ asser@@ ol@@ ing people who pl@@ ough@@ ing the pl@@ eit@@ ing online .
the mail correspon@@ ded with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ ogan .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not fulfilled , but she asked to hate hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people on the same subject is taking place , then they will be mis@@ counted as a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
as the members of the govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably call other &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; .
the Facebook era makes it easy to attribute a message by blocking one critic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors , to burn , and to silence protest@@ ers and to silence .
but exactly this happens just digit@@ ally .
H@@ ogan is not the first public officials to critic@@ ise him that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is proc@@ laim by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feeds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County coun@@ selling the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a record from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received an AC@@ L@@ U visit for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of an affordable portrait had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers registered between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous wal@@ kers sm@@ ashed on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington decisions .
pet@@ iti@@ oning , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the Trade and Shipping with Britain , have been overcome , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put it to silence .
freedom of speech , opinion of opinion , and courses are on the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the ex @-@ Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days at home comfort because the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the end of the year , before being joined by Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue and operated as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches its fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is an e@@ ager @-@ supp@@ orter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won both in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the players in South@@ port .
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since they had won them in the year , when I was taken out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year .
it was a truly special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came back to the European Senior Tour once a year earlier this year , returns to the home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you sens@@ ed this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy as it has gone so far . &quot;
with the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ulty .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance fee is free , the parking lot is £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary pancre@@ as by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people are dying due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
researchers from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to that result in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases is due to passive smoking accidents , &quot; said student director Hei@@ ko Becher .
in comparison , he drew a study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household connections prove to be very complex
the construction work on the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lying in time , &quot; said the ladder by Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of home ports , the situation is more complicated than thought , as the underground there is in the ground , which is not noticeable in the plans .
the traffic , which has always hin@@ dered the construction works , represents a big problem for the component of the company .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers in front of red lights and bar@@ riers are already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to pass .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of the Stum@@ pp company has been working with the work on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting .
luck@@ ily , we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with a cool mineral water , &quot; explains Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , they do not use stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ards in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua New Guinea , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato , locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the hol@@ low dum@@ ped is taken with e@@ ager , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also takes her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space is used as lat@@ rine .
the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives were assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
of course , late at work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .

it is a rare gli@@ mp@@ se of the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua New Zealand , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were to vote in the occupation forces .
an existing movement , which touched the independence of Dutch government , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea , in which the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as soon as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the town of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ ambo@@ o f@@ ences , and from wave ro@@ ofs , which were transformed from rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey back here , some journalists , and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans for@@ warded a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .

Papua New Indonesia &apos;s poo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and alp@@ habet rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable Gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a Hoch@@ land Province in the Size of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed by 3.1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Papua New Guinea &apos;s assets is valued at an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these wealth , however , are a source of mis@@ ery to the Papua New to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military are preser@@ ving an initial presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 150,000 US dollars on a single officer .
pap@@ u@@ anian claims , after greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden g@@ ans and are treated by mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists of activists , more than 500,000 species have been killed and thousands were ra@@ ped since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 .
mass mortality in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe in the 1970s , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , became the genocide of genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian Police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year .
&quot; we Bec@@ oming Everything &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 in which reports about atro@@ cities are included in the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week of inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
bolts have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources present a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim economy mig@@ rant have come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

the Indonesian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as the Jok@@ er , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua New York during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter , 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua New Guinea , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , is on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New has changed little , and today the loc@@ als are che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a tro@@ ugh just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them to turn on their lights .
one of the soldiers took the impulse to their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and struck the group with their rif@@ le , said victims and witnesses .
then a soldier was fired in the children &apos;s group .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ ul@@ anus Y@@ e@@ mo , was so heavily sm@@ itten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ated on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered for a football pitch before the local police station and the military service centre to ask justice .
they bore hun@@ t@@ onal hun@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in a circle and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some protest@@ ers began to escape police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command to an internal funk : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official document of TIM@@ E which has not been released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the atmosphere .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly appeared on my left wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house .
but the Kay@@ ak still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and looking for his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , as many Indones@@ ians had named one name , the TIM@@ E was in a dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the che@@ ek spec@@ tor of the Papua New police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ists that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; because they would be attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves , if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of Papua New police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many other injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came first &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta in the following day .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i took a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and weak@@ ens the historical properties in Papua New Guinea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he establishes a judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights ab@@ uses .
but the expressions began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the early 2000 @-@ s years .
the point is that we have committed to address these violations , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto was a retreat when he spoke to Jak@@ arta on 5 June with TIM@@ E and said that he had no plans in Papua New Guinea .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims are contrary to these alleg@@ ations associated with gri@@ mm@@ ing un@@ believers .
&quot; I inter@@ viewed four times during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the shooting paintings are not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction firm who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
rising vill@@ agers prot@@ ested to the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers , who re@@ acted by pushing the warning shots .
but loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began shooting down and killing a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and as the last one was delivered quickly as the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the officers to the one and the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trou@@ blem@@ an for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ ally , who live in the green Highlands .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , that claims to defend the rights of Papua New by shooting spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of the Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den K@@ og@@ oya .
in response , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some diving never again .
among the people in Papua New Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; a trag@@ ical , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als .
bread is just beyond range .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potato potato .
they reserve most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a sam@@ pled only 10.000 indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between native Papua New Guinea and the new migrants who have arrived at the Nab@@ ire airport since the opening of new flight routes .
the few jobs that exist in the region are generally depicted on the better educated and weal@@ thy migrants .
Papua New York seldom have the capital or the necessary capabilities to competitive their own company .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the headquarters of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua New Guinea .
in addition , limitations of coverage of international media remains ten@@ ded .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp was deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Zealand , although rare permission to films were given .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Secretary of Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises were made by Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaigns to raise the limitations of coverage , to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighborhood of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ aci@@ dic countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injury &quot; in Papua New , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Fo@@ undry .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
the speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed out the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments should take this knowledge .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura , on 4th May , indigenous her silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they probably won &apos;t match Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the headquarters .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai nation , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of an peas@@ ant military , is in arm@@ ati@@ ous educational and health services .
g@@ ob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ people , like other Papua New Guinea , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ pl@@ u@@ alties resulted in the last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the body of a victim was buried on a complex over the police and the military station .
they know that they might never forget justice , but at least , they do not forget the persons responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a clear head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire found on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents out of 337 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in only two years by the high @-@ rise , that is named by the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , violations were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we were standing at the fire al@@ arms and at the scre@@ wing of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor down to the bottom , &quot; told a resident who had his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 o GMT ) fire extingu@@ ished and cooling down the building .
the government said , she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident may issue questions about the safety of materials that are used in outside areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
a study conducted by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the largest part of the damage caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or isolation .
in Great Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates related to isolation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people .
no Davis Cup Reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the general assembly .
at the Ho Chi Minh City meeting held at Ho Chi Minh City , the winner of this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup singles only play on two winning sets , doesn &apos;t support the rear @-@ thin by the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact , often very long , but also very well estimated five @-@ set classic stay on the traditional value .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for reform , the aim of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members does not have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty .
one will continue to work , to improve the score .
at all , not only for the vote , the suggest@@ ion had come to stand out the final at a neutral place .
new from 2018 , only compar@@ atively smaller details are : so the fin@@ alists will have the right round in the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup in the following round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements for training possibilities , etc. are facil@@ it@@ ates and the players must complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers forbidden objects into the plane , find a survey
a survey among flying passengers revealed that over 20 percent are aware of or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items involved in the inspection points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally banned knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered delay to be mist@@ re@@ prob@@ able with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey in more than 1,000 persons - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also sure that the younger trav@@ ellers have viol@@ ated the rules .
from those surveyed admitted that they have attempted to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of the generation X .
the most common objects that have been deliberately tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food@@ stuffs and liquids .
more than 3 per cent reported that they were carried by security control by security control while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they had inten@@ tionally forbidden drugs into the plane .
the company said it was questioned around the country to find out how many sm@@ ug@@ ly sm@@ ug@@ ing goods were brought by airport security and how many could have inten@@ tionally done .
it is no surprise that people who are most common of sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - to those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are something complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uns@@ af@@ e which liquids they may take away , or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount adopted by T@@ SA seized physical objects prohibited .
a time for the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ ly ware .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers Order Order
electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has under@@ gone , that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its un@@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant numbers on sales gains and more gigantic sales targets , Tesla @-@ chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has shown another , less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancell@@ ations made during the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k was frequently asked with more than 500.000 openings for the new car whose delivery begins straight .
Mus@@ k has now dreamed : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics had always pointed out again , that it is merely a non @-@ committ@@ al reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla is paying the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation payment &quot; completely back .
at the moment 45@@ 5,000 such un@@ binding reservations required , Mus@@ k , in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of so far , approximately twelve percent of all orders could be a problem , but Tesla &apos;s boss does not believe .
its argument : the ambitious target of growth is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it will be - all models - 500,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations each day .
who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; will be charged with delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates its brand new , never in practice tested production roads without any longer inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity .
many experts , doubts that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the un@@ warran@@ ties of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company cannot hin@@ der the company un@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt push for reduction of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott took P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , re@@ alizing his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ caused air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned to the needs of government authorities in relation to previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint against his prior position in a Federal Court of Appeals .
it is a time limit , which ran on 1 October for States to comply with the o@@ zone standards for the area of o@@ zone o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would carry out compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; in local decisions , or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , had long time for a reliable enemy of stren@@ uous environmental protection legislation .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly occurred , to block regulations , or to delay the chemical industry and the manufacturing of fossil fuels .
the sudden change from Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ de regulatory back@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to pursue the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane tra@@ cks .
on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his car@@ bu@@ ds at o@@ zone standards had simply proposed the willingness of EPA to collabor@@ ate with the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA often has held the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited for determin@@ ing activist groups and others , and in an agreement the appointment for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , compl@@ ained to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; we do not believe in regulation of jurisdiction , and we take fri@@ days seriously .
we also take the law and authority that there is so serious . &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt revealed his &quot; satisfaction to delay and all other legal consequences &quot; to ensure that the provisions on a solid policy and the best available information are based . &quot;
Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress pushing a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
one in the last month of approval of the bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years .
the action was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who managed the Coalition to proc@@ laim the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6,7 million new Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans that are affected directly from the smo@@ g that are poured into their communities . &quot;
new York joined California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ Oz@@ on arises when pollut@@ ants consists of cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the de@@ standing smoke can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health services and the environ@@ ment@@ alists compl@@ ained about P@@ ru@@ al &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is worried as much pressure needed to obtain this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; we need to fight on the ide@@ ological head of the Tr@@ ump government to join the poll@@ uting and its special interests . &quot;

according to the certificate , according to the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church , there was also a splendid court , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there were also humans there .
as seen from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the outskirts of tum@@ ours , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the magnificent settlement of the village .

there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .

the newly created bell was first discovered in 16@@ 92 , but had to be returned later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were broken down and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ den@@ sely .
in 1796 , French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the ch@@ anc@@ el and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the Dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the steep@@ le was left .
in the New Year of 1834 , a storm split the steep@@ le storm and half collapsed .
in order to prevent evil , the tower was ab@@ orted .

club wants to check auth@@ orization of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim w@@ rest@@ ores &quot; does not look any legal pre@@ mise for building and has therefore turned aside to the estate .
the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim Club &quot; bo@@ arded , &quot; coun@@ cill@@ or Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) is required to reverse its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ man N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette could not have been approved in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen just existed at the city limit to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone exists .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are possible in principle , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind power use for the rest of the city .
according to zones , a &quot; rec@@ lam@@ ation &quot; of the landscape should prevent the landscape .
the city was a few days earlier by a change in the territorial plan a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which , however , had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ less@@ er .
&quot; due to the lack of planning file the granted auth@@ orization has been granted a modest decision , just as far as illegal and therefore , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the current state of affairs : in front of the summer break , the wind concentration camp has decided again in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an permission from the District government is still standing .
this is , in this place , the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind energy systems are excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has passed since the past week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; declared a spokes@@ man .
the circle gives them an opportunity to test the affair again .
they do not lead to it , however , that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the proceedings at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday was not subject to the argument of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim Club &quot; to express itself .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is located on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 meters high wind turbines .
already in the past year , the company was engaged in which the town is fourth @-@ bar , with the owner of the approx . 65 hectares of land was closed .
with the construction of the four wind power plants , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can meet - which corresponds to roughly one @-@ fifth of all four @-@ grown households .
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind farm L@@ inn@@ ich near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg , district Hein@@ berg district .

city and distributor plan &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants at the shopping center in the city center .
like the chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping p@@ opp@@ en &quot; aims to sens@@ ori@@ ze the customers that offers their own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
the market is planned to be a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
domestic companies are also to present their apprentices@@ hip sets .
moreover , the shops of the city center will invite &quot; mit@@ tern@@ ich @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
the promotion is not just on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on radio , internet video and printed bags that point on the Active weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal authorities and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of commerce and industry .
thus the Trade Association and the City are entering a further stage of the &quot; Attrac@@ tive Center &quot; project .
added to this include new offers as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sal@@ ut@@ ated Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ ders and owners to move them to active participation .
attractive offers to Saturday and the disc@@ laim@@ er on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
customers should also be re @-@ opened to customer potential or re @-@ established again .
it includes courses and tourists .
but many loc@@ als have lost the inner city centre at the shopping centre .
in the end , all would have to contribute to bel@@ low the city center - to land@@ lords , factories of all over the city and clubs .
it was told , with a network overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy which partially wider , King had said in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , the head of the I@@ HK Center in M@@ ühl@@ hausen , with the fact that the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; festival , in the first time five Thuring@@ ian cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , the o@@ dom@@ y , a holy city and lead @-@ place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners are also clear that every citizen can potentially influence his own environment itself .

Moo@@ res Ford &apos;s massacre : activists of the rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as calling for justice again
a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mercury launched a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train on his cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside them the occup@@ ants rock@@ ed the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! , &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cry to the silence , as a young black man from the passenger seat was dis@@ closed .
fortunately , this terrible scene was played on July 22nd , but only one night .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience shot very real sigh@@ s .
since 2005 , citizenship rights for Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge came back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ col@@ m , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - joined the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was indicted for murder .

&quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen .
for him the reproduction as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community , an in@@ justice never has been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we cannot get healed and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court medic@@ ally disc@@ ern a towel over the bodies of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FBI agents , which were obtained by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding Coun@@ ties were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on un@@ reachable since decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always well @-@ known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme court ruled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time in Georgia to vote for their voices in the summer .
about at the same time , according to the FBI &apos;s election , Roger Mal@@ col@@ m has a white basic owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while a struggle - allegedly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said , it was rum@@ our that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she was wearing not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she moved away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge entered her , ring a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b her car .
as it emerg@@ es , it was Harrison who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; includes an FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates things yet .
&quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual re@@ appointment by the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is clearly proved , att@@ acking and being justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , many believed that he does not exist in America anymore .
it is difficult to look , and watch more difficult , but gre@@ ens said that it is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confron@@ ted with the ug@@ ness in ourselves , &quot; she said .
&quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors were th@@ ron@@ ged - a dozen white and the rest of black - entered into a room and settled , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the head @-@ band member since years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ gra@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ col@@ m and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester bit@@ es and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; I said , n --- he w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a Ans@@ wer the Fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
gre@@ ens laughs at the est .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ gling .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think the white people at that time &apos; n --- He &apos; said . &quot;
... &quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ch@@ eted one of the other black perform@@ ers .
&quot; you only need to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly there is the energy in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone is concerned to get this correctly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once more .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a tells the N word , he says it is sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there is scre@@ am , shots and then st@@ illness .
a woman , clothed with a mour@@ n@@ ful dress , is about the bodies of the actors and performs Che@@ ap Holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred metres behind it , there is a group of about four dozen spectators and tears out of their eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as heavy storms every eight hours , when Broo@@ ks brought them on a pilgri@@ mage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you find on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels isolated .
when the last notes of songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites people to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ urs a little boy , as if he should remember .
after a few minutes , gre@@ ens ow@@ es a lot - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the ly@@ we@@ dge away and wi@@ pe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w re@@ im@@ pover@@ t Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , which the C@@ lan@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his players and then breaks in their arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; someone whis@@ per@@ ed women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this out of a reason . &quot;
later , the audience sat down together with the actors for dinner .
talking at a table a white couple from Atlanta stim@@ ulates over the reproduction with a black pair , which they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was strug@@ gled to find words how the performance had left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you own and do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks Hof on his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspir@@ ational in a certain way , because it describes the horror of what we have to endure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it is like we learn from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own story , he who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; id@@ ol@@ d@@ ämmer@@ ung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with cast@@ at , but it was also an understanding of its visual appearance .
I am taking a positive res@@ ume .
Max . works as Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er
they work in their volunteers right at several locations .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture shop , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture unit .
and I have already worked in the open full day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
amount : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with juven@@ iles , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so is a late volunteer volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I have completed SL@@ C .
and then a graduate studies , we say , was successful .
I recognized for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different , working with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the burning point perhaps , really is .
and it was like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start studying social welfare in the winter semester .
I am going to study dual , and probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t H@@ erne at@@ tain a social worker and study at Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual to have several different applications during the volunteers ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you do the FS@@ J .
you can make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work .
it was very diverse in me .
I was also part of the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me , this was the right thing that was irrit@@ ating me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about to calculate statistical statistics here .
one has always some other people , each of which have a very different story behind him .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you must always enter individually .
very interesting .
and they had no contact information ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a range that gives a lot .
lots of love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that is life .
Pear@@ son got another 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son , on Friday , will build further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , since another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure where the company was confron@@ ted .
the job reduction , Director General John Fall@@ on will largely be announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 places were lost already .
in May in a third cost reduction programme , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction of cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a shop that was hit by the quick step towards digital learning .
the company , which had expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , having obtained an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
vo@@ vo@@ i attack of Kabul : NATO @-@ soldier killed at suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kabul , killed by NATO and killed several other , say civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been hurt , NATO dispos@@ ed of NATO .
according to local reports , local reports resulted in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district , also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violent , who hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
NATO &apos;s opinion is said to be the explosion on Thursday evening when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; carried out &quot; by persons . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state and in the U.S. military hospital are treated at the Bag@@ ram field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops at the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which were in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killing at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
violence emphas@@ ises the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump weak@@ ened the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents may say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks also have a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and particularly in the call of President Ash@@ raf G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision on the delay of the smo@@ g @-@ Rule to Kl@@ agen@@ ic
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of Obama administration in which the States agreed to classi@@ fy the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions , after 15 states accused the agency for the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to move the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; and said , &quot; it is showing the commitment of the agency to cooperate with States .
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our state partner , &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation .
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA , to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in a portion of the country of pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured to determine where the cuts must be taken to delay more stric@@ ter air@@ quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint in Tuesday and said that an effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to im@@ itate a broad range of environmental impacts , which imposed former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have caused the impact of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the effects of bigger emissions to public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function , and can ampli@@ fy respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
Common Room wants to be shared
at the end , the decision was clear : on two denom@@ inations , the community head of flu@@ x p@@ auses decides to set up the facility of a common room in the future retirement plant .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for which still missing basic property was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas reports .
although it is still going to last until the municipality of Church is owned in the town &apos;s property , there is no planning thing for this private investor , which is now part of a private investor .
there is a discussion concerning a common room .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and a ad@@ joining terrace with a total of 70 square metres of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Common Assembly con@@ ven@@ es such a common room not to be seen as a meeting point only for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ical living area , but open into the church .
as an example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
this decision will be reconc@@ iled by the delivery of funds for the current budget in the last autumn , by delivery possibilities .
the construction is in the renovation area .
the furnishings of a common room would be , thus , T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent can be eligible .
the decision proposal to signal the investor is that in this regard , there is no p@@ ples between the legs , which is close to him that both sem@@ it@@ ers - what reduces the level of setting - what the tr@@ ash level reduces and the construction of economic power - could be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this additi@@ ve .
when it helps : unanimously he happens the panel .
not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings with which one is not going forward with such a word , and you can now rest in the common room from the window , says : &quot; I do so hard . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ iger certainly speaks for the common room - but completely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y at rewards or even foreign investors .
that &apos;s not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you give no access , but get a real , in case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers , motion for resolution accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
so it remains with two objects on the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; if we handle the decision , we make a huge step , to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

An@@ cel@@ otti made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team has been responsible for the five defe@@ ats over the past six tests .
&quot; we know we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance of the team .
the last was not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team demonstrates these qualities .
the team is ready .

in the Har@@ z of Stern walking to star
in the Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; star@@ base path &quot; will arise .
the Observ@@ atory of the Observ@@ atory of Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning .
there is a planetary track in Göttingen - since 2003 .
one &quot; star@@ base path &quot; will come contrary to the need of many har@@ z@@ visitors , the name of it .
he binding nature , science , movement , and sporting performance .
the members want to gather along the scheduled Route bars , and inform about stars and star pictures .
in a first phase to 2018 , the &quot; good @-@ achiev@@ able installations plans in five to six locations &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ ference boxes St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown , Hoh@@ enz@@ y and S@@ ieber .
information on the boards are to be complem@@ ented by the internet .
this is why the site selection includes a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
the star@@ ing path should be extended by train .
&quot; the viewer found a lot of knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual star , &quot; explained the association .
moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was stronger than another , although it goes far away .
also , in which constellation can find yourself a certain star , and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest observ@@ atory observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park , Har@@ z , is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there are the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with naked eye clearly .
in the university city , there has been something similar to the Planet@@ arium &apos;s initiative since 2003 - a bit similar to the planned ast@@ ron@@ au@@ g - the planet road .
beginning with Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads with its stel@@ ae up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Town@@ ship ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the down@@ ward down@@ gra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end - are set precisely in the distance and scale of one to two billions .
the earth shr@@ unk so on a ball of 6,5 mm diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , the sun is less than 70 centi@@ meters .
the planet &apos;s total distance is just four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need an hour to stand with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
but the march to next fi@@ xation would last a half year .

four Ver@@ nia for T@@ ire Bo@@ ats
on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured during an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lasted 16 : 30 shortly before the connection of the market , probably after a tire @-@ place to control over his vehicle .
the passenger car pushed right into the vil@@ e@@ tion , where he struck and then lying on the roof in the dressing room .
four passengers - two adults and two children - were injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance , the A7 was locked in direction north for about one hour , thereafter the traffic on the left driving force was passed by accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; spin @-@ chain works better &quot;
after the 2 : 2 season , Andre Hoffmann is hop@@ ed for Braunschweig with the optim@@ isation of the immune information into Au@@ e points .
with the first seasonal match Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there were not the two opponents as well as 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; two opponents were too much , and we have to watch even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the rotary chain will also be optimized .
and one gate after a fre@@ ash do not want to fall again any more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that there is no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also gets better after the experience in preparation with the fil@@ ming chain , than with the qu@@ ett@@ les chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , however , is sure , &quot; because we have just managed to build on the semi @-@ positions at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the requirement is , but that we do better harmon@@ ize , and we do not afford so many def@@ ences . &quot;
of course , Hoffmann is home to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; but if one cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ erable start , I don &apos;t know .
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that , his coach wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start to the season I only began after six to eight play days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel who did not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a weather forecast .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home match , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann that players may be from Au@@ e maybe even a little more fresh , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a pick @-@ up fav@@ ored in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the King &apos;s defense of Fort@@ una .
the guests come from the Rhineland as lighter favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga which one must hit from the outs@@ et , &quot; Fort@@ unas CEO coach .
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so , Fun@@ kel wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden to under@@ go a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes the accuracy of this results .
the Swedish National Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine has started the conduct of tests last year .
they are to be more exact during the asylum application of the age , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ational et ) for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees has been crit@@ ici@@ zed at the age of age .
mig@@ r@@ ations has been sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency informed that the person &quot; might be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the person is asked in question .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are durable during the past months .
&quot; we see no difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged for more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have weighed over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases to propose that the under@@ searched person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det found the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it would be 18 years old .
the method of medical assessment , where X @-@ rays of wisdom teachings and MRI recordings are analyzed , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work comprises the assessment of biological maturity of humans , to see if they walked earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way , is very uncertain .
if we can &apos;t tell it , we should not do it as if we could see it , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child as an adult is small .
the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully within the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are going well .
a concrete structure was erected on Wednesday at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Manager at the Department of Stre@@ ets and Transport at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
in April , the works began simultaneously on all three moderni@@ zation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a gun bridge made of concrete , which is faced with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges are leading to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built by red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were constructed in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on Wednesday morning a 1.@@ 30 meter width and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge fla@@ p .
this is an Rand@@ om fixing , which is also used as a business way .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metres long bridge folder will be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian path should then run .
the special thing is that it is finished with finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented glasses .
particular finger@@ tip sensitivity has caused the laying of lines due to the building work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable , connected to the many firms .
the residents were informed of the project in advance by hand@@ outs on the project .
first fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building farm and the gathering point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is closely controlled by a traffic light .
for building work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher of the entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is locked .
the costs for the three bridge areas amount to 700 000 euros .

it is not so frequent that parties pull on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , everything else is difficult to bring down to a hat .
the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcanoes parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance in that day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell for a poster &quot; large election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already ahead of the event before the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D Group , but demonstrated .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but will now be on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers you .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the forum One World and one of the relevant organizers , rejo@@ ices : &quot; great , as many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ gy potato salad which could also eat the Af@@ D without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police has ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence , especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venue .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario homosexu@@ als reports about the Af@@ D volcanoes that he has been trying to get an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked in Dau@@ n at first , but there was a cancellation , because because of the former Laur@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces .
so , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; that &apos;s the good right of people , main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
it &apos;s also done : at about 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ enn@@ ese Af@@ D leader Uwe boy .
in the audit@@ orium there are about 200 listen@@ ers waiting to wait for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Prime Minister of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than one hour the Af@@ D event , which guests on the front side have a longer breath , but also there is a short time later after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can back up - no special inci@@ dents .

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and they will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks openly about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; when I bite a grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; .
the probably best known relationship of Hollywood celebr@@ ities was the &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , which ultimately became bitter .
despite alle@@ y@@ ure the brunette performer of the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve made .
or do you believe me , I could have played it ? &quot;
according to her separation , Kri@@ sten gave her that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I always lived in du@@ alism and believed seriously .
so it has never been pu@@ zz@@ led or ob@@ struc@@ ted me .
it could never be taken seriously either , not seriously . &quot;
especially among them suffered them loud &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the school season , when they rather disgu@@ ised as a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really under attack , an@@ x@@ ious and con@@ founded .
now I look back and think to me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially public they don &apos;t love their love life : &quot; the people expect you to have a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps some think me some as und@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify me before the whole public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia Announ@@ ces that he changes the party
the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats got away from me , &quot; said governor Justice .
&quot; today I &apos;ll tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will say you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally was breaking out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t appro@@ ve the democratic candidate at Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire resident in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes report that he has inherited carbon dioxide in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republican National Committee on Thursday night issued a statement in which it said , &quot; The party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather go to us than to make our land great again . &quot;
&quot; only 15 gover@@ ments and the control of the least law@@ makers in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , more positive message , &quot; said R@@ NC Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the world leader of ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to become again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s ath@@ le@@ tics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct in the sport and that he was determined to fight the d@@ oping .
he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all the athletes competing in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) reports on state @-@ funded d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to rep@@ orters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lete from the wi@@ de@@ ed system , &quot; added :
the n@@ inet@@ een Russian athletes will begin with the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setup .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited coach are still ongoing , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy for mut@@ ed in Mali
around 1000 people of the two soldiers were thought of a funeral march in Mali with a funeral service in the North H@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety checks .
to the still un@@ explained statement , Secretary of Defense , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CDU ) said nothing .
they called the two inver@@ ted pilots but as a &quot; skill of their field . &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they declared in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief Apostle of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come into life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their swar@@ ms were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a tot@@ alling guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter and on Thursday .
at noon , only the relatives in the Church came farewell .
then the funeral service began in the field of family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them also H@@ ess@@ ens &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general insp@@ ect of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
wor@@ ries laid ro@@ ses , the relatives having arms in arm on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of Defense from the Ley@@ en , who described the re@@ aped soldiers , decorated as &quot; highly &quot; and &quot; sat@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Administr@@ ative has built the flight operation of the helicopter gun Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , Germany , and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers were , stated : &quot; if these crew won &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali , the Minister of Ley@@ en did not say : the action is dangerous .
but it is also of high importance , &quot; for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said .
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ees were brought out of the cathedral .
when and when they are att@@ acking , the German army made no data information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants to be a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , doesn &apos;t want to be buried after his wife .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish king pair is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen would agree with her husband &apos;s decision , called it on communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik can be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to join in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a sig@@ ehl that he was not happy with his title .
he would be like King of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
in 2016 he retired and puts the title &quot; Princ@@ arding &quot; as well .
since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and the function he wanted to see his wife not as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by declared the chief of the Danish King &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately un@@ clear .
but he did not have the int@@ ent to join in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he enjoys the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
the native @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later woman , Prince Hen@@ rik had always been trying to flee by Prince Hen@@ rik , in his almost 50 @-@ year rule over the Dan@@ e , had a serious stand .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival was everything I did .
my Danish was gorgeous , I prefer wine instead of beer , so@@ aps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of soccer .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ om , which I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and who had allowed the call to be the brand to be the mark of critical intellec@@ tuals , I couldn &apos;t hope for the night .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to fix new choice
CDU and F@@ DP from potential majority in Lower Saxony
because of the loss of the red @-@ green government , Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is forced to re@@ sign a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign .
he said on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprising exit of a Green @-@ Members in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Gre@@ ens Champion El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its electoral circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday .
CDU faction Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group to absorb it .
that would have CDU and F@@ DP in 69 seats in the Lower Saxony &apos;s Day , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new day &apos;s day will be elected regular on 14 January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could ruling in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil is holding an indispensable thing , that the land day decides to decide on his self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the constitution also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s prime minister has drawn up the trust and cho@@ oses his successor .
&quot; our constitution offers multiple options .
these possibilities must be strictly checked , &quot; says Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; you will discuss any questions in peace if they are legally verified . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; west@@ ens step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the polit@@ ician herself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
they described himself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens requested the ab@@ rupt par@@ r@@ ents to return to their territory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) , agriculture minister Christian Schmidt ( R@@ ND ) address and answer .
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect yourself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumer to view the eggs in your fridge and check out the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the German states have the most recent information on the affected eggs in bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we know currently , a health haz@@ ards is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis campaign - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of clari@@ fier by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is part of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been shut down immediately and has been informed of Germany &apos;s parties in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
the trade has the same way to worry , that the products sold in@@ capable and health are un@@ think@@ able .
if the back@@ stroke rate of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not bu@@ oy@@ ancy .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time you are not to blame .
sit production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
after the ze@@ al characteristic , the production plants meets no immediate guilt .
rather , they have to reck@@ on with economic damage due to suspected illegal practices of service firms .
as always there is too little control in harvest .
is it lacking in personnel or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have exposed the process .
however , for truth , however , food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
therefore , however , a consistent development of such events and hand@@ over to the leaders of the parties in the cases where crimes can be presented are crucial .
I have already made several times clearly that I expect the responsibility of the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm mis@@ m necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get solely safe and secure food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are entitled to law .
by the arm@@ or means producers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de fi@@ li@@ stics in attitude to life @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it must be rig@@ or@@ ously consistently with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is c@@ auti@@ ously and un@@ explained .
how to move the Finance rules of the football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to target enormous issues of European football matches won &apos;t inter@@ fere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
there are some consequences for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA yet , because the leading organization controlled the European game has the power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
the financial fair play rules , which was launched in 2011 by the UEFA Cup , mean that PS@@ G must point out at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million US ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make the money loose with safety , so that N@@ ey@@ mar is under@@ writing and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the Qatar @-@ rich rulers of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend much money for the acquisition of players , but with legitim@@ ate springs , they must allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their way to the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Platinum after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in when banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P reli@@ ed from the concentration of the club &apos;s debts to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model was used by Roman Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter .
for the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses in the amount of € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini dropped by the presidency in the Con@@ gn@@ ad in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ ment continues to take advantage of excessive expend@@ itu@@ res .
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package deal , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the deposits can be exp@@ elled for the next five years amounting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 is the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the worst sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( back then $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million Euros , and it was ordered that the teams will be limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 @-@ 15 season .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outw@@ ard their financial statements by linked up their income by companies that are linked to the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic corporation may sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA must not be considered a legitim@@ ate income .
exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEFA concluded that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA of the Qatar Tourism Authority had been pu@@ ffed up .
it has been reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be made by the organis@@ ational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar was informed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be amb@@ ass@@ adors to find out that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be simply evacu@@ ated for UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA is more attentive , to consider any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA has no preparation with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , told the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of the An@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not fu@@ elled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year will have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot .
the Association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the contract .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ ener by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; fin@@ anci@@ ally D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars and the official owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it &apos;s very difficult to respect the financial play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
Ch@@ ocol@@ ate Fre@@ y Board @-@ Chocolate for Swiss Made in the past few years .
now the welcome cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ jects the contract .
Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Northern western Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , Air@@ line will shut up a new agreement in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and under@@ gone a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Ch@@ ocol@@ ate Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokesperson .
some 17 million small rot@@ or packed sha@@ des of 14 grams per year spread the flight atten@@ dant to the passengers .
over the costs the Swiss wanted to do no data .
industry insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the order volume according to &quot; North West Swiss &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs , with an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a g@@ og@@ gi@@ ate manufacturer it is an prestigious contract .
like many applicants on the new call , Swiss does not like to betra@@ y Swiss .
only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper article , Ch@@ ocol@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to make an effort of the agreement over the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the biggest Swiss chocolate @-@ manufacturer was not accessible to an opinion .
ch@@ ocol@@ ates boards distribute the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before Swiss got a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo was Swiss prior to two and a half years ago with Ch@@ ocol@@ ate Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights the customers of the first Class with treats of conf@@ ection@@ ery is spo@@ iled , in business Class n@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Ch@@ ocol@@ ate Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Ch@@ ocol@@ ate Fre@@ y distributed both in business as well as in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia continues in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; to the niche
this repet@@ ition of the story is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise , it feels like that time .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was not surprising , not only because of its absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking canned vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by getting on the core of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages play hor@@ ny children who will grow up - nevertheless , they make the possibility to win the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who now play adults , is less emotional ro@@ oted and his par@@ ody goes more after the shooting down principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ er years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that cra@@ ck the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at a point to brow@@ se a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ tic@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ icious Plot with which Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ n@@ old ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian &apos;s ) .
as always the courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ imm@@ ens@@ at@@ che of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old bu@@ h@@ acker .
there are the moments of chance to heat this fran@@ chise like a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling quar@@ ry .

it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than one idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to view ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch out chess on TV , as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ persons - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Fin@@ ger &apos; voice .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda of propaganda - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Reagan mask , is involved in the fact that it is often like a single .
with six long episodes it passes away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ produced on a smaller length , could even better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef will always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who w@@ asted a bun@@ ch of ham@@ pers .
the message for the imag@@ ined Communist public is that western culture can make everything for food for a age .

impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched during the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart .
15 mo@@ ths were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already arrest warran@@ ts issued against them already issued .
in addition , the officers provided larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same time , two persons were arrested in Italy .
German arrest warran@@ ts were issued against the two susp@@ ects .
these two are therefore expected to be delivered to Germany .
the action took part in the Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were used in total .
the members of the Mafia was accused of drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and rob@@ ber@@ y .
in the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office was established against organised drug dealers in the South German region .
between the offices in Constance and Palermo there was an exchange exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the large insert on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo .
in the vision of studies , Italian nationals combined with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on 27th May in Hil@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant in the early morning , is likely to go on the bank account .
a wise acc@@ laim large g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany .
this lead to partly serious lack of mis@@ judgement on asylum procedures .
the representative for refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , sent a media report according to large g@@ aps in the country key register .
short@@ com@@ ings for the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and deportation orders &quot; in part of serious lack of failure , &quot; warned in an analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the register , ten million people have been identified with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by about 600 emig@@ rants in Germany .
because the data were not adequate , the data quality in parts have not been well @-@ maintained so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who are long no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizen and should not appear anymore in the register . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data input can slow down recur@@ ring processes , so the report continues .
in statistics on foreign citizens , EU citizens should be captured , which would not have to travel .
such false senti@@ ments , however , led to a dist@@ orted debate on how to deal with reconciliation , therefore it is therefore in analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy when they travelled from there .
this is based on an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es , &quot; the New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ back Newspaper . &quot;
in the paper it is called the B@@ AM@@ F lead the proceedings relating to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper appl@@ au@@ ded with reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the departure .
the post office is now available : &quot; in the meantime , the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy have given guarantees for reception and accommodation by families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold on these additives for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children , due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of human rights ab@@ sent@@ ing conditions and a threat of child life . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , a total of 220 litres were already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , in the meantime , distributed 100 litres of blood in the meantime .
traditionally , the congregation comm@@ ends multiple willingness to don@@ ate multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is brilli@@ antly , as our body is created and we will sacrifice the don@@ ors for donations that their blood is available for foreigners , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .

for example , three people might benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported from the promotions being carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; in this year we achieved 114 donations , the second best result , &quot; said the DRC .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will likely be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening the spec@@ ulations have damp@@ ened over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; will remain &quot; as they kept interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthened pressure .
the policy makers of the European Commission ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted by 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members rising in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing demand .
in their quarterly inflation report the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 , the pressure on the budget would continue to continue , although inflation in the fall is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but she signals that in the coming years , interest rate would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and it said that the loan might need to rise more than expected to the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economic stim@@ ulus , which was published before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time to finance the financial plan to provide budget financing for banks , even though it is expected that they will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in part of this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , stressed that enhanc@@ ements would be &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s projected growth progn@@ osis of this and next year are projected to 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound dropped to these messages , compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the latest disap@@ pointing growth rates have slow@@ ed on average expectations and increase the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to grow at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover easily after the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households which will be affected by increasing inflation and low @-@ level cav@@ ities , because mer@@ ging first becomes even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pace .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last judgment , the call to interest rates was increased after inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three political decision makers in July require a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
the Bank said , the aims at the ratio to its target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; to the weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ cab@@ al , director of Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the lending force was heavily looking for shops and that year in positive way .
the market is especially good for those who exclu@@ de the existing De@@ als and include the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free @-@ free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should prop@@ el 10,000 people un@@ disputed
patients will receive access to the Roche High Court for funding from the High Court against funding of the medicine in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV @-@ prevention treatment .
N@@ HS England gave evidence that a pre @-@ risk reduction group ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk provision@@ ing by about 86 percent , now is delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was preparing to finance the trial after the Court of Appeals in the last year confirmed the condem@@ nation of the N@@ HS , in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
a chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will belong to the first to follow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ ex@@ position Spec@@ phy@@ ry ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV medicine that are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of an HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection endangered .
Pr@@ EP just before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or for two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those responsible for the treatment in question , gay or bis@@ exual men , tran@@ ss@@ exual and persons with HIV positive partners , who were not successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified whom the study agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be familiar with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are living in England and registered with a resident , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicine in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study should assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP as well as clinical evidence of being collected , taken into operation and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in preser@@ ving one of the biggest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if targeted people are targeted in need and vulner@@ able people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England have to develop a new instrument that will really be individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner which leads to many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now must be realized that the study is undertaken rapidly throughout the country , and there is no one who has left a risk for HIV .
now that the Pr@@ EP test medicine was purchased , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is due to months delay and delayed implementation by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence demonstrate how trans@@ itional this drug may be part of our approach to the HIV @-@ prevention and termin@@ ate the transmission of these vital infection .
this attempt will bring us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society to come closer . &quot;
live life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ sted in 2014 by a major house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I love myself in love and made an offer on this day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1.000 square foot of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a tel@@ egra@@ ph layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Stau@@ d@@ hood and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous covers .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the Archit@@ ectural Design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Notting Hill , to create a 12.5 @-@ foot high ceilings to create a home , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other , so that the archit@@ ect@@ onic challenge was to create a mezzanine , where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative in order to solve the alleg@@ ations .
&quot; the steel works quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so far that they were st@@ acked on each other , without having to g@@ aps ourselves .
it was not only about building a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had the right height above or below the right altitude . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down on the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
sp@@ read@@ ed gold @-@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ r@@ oring plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red , to make it longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ p@@ ated units offer space for all the sitting areas and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous space , the beauty of living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineer went in , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; it &apos;s contrary to it that when you push the door moving , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , one extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , real estate agents will enter and apply a calculation based on the ground @-@ size . &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the floor space , and to use high @-@ quality materials , which make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love you in the electrical outlets in the walls .
they are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can be changed through good design and increased loads of something that can be transformed into something quite unique .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could choose to leave this not .

Paul was trying to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp meditation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in worth more than half a billion dollars , then since the family moved to Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the Stadt@@ zen@@ rum , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . bull as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Colin has been described by Paul as &quot; principal driver and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company assets and Paul about one third .
a judicial review states that this means that Colin has owned money worth $ 316 million and worth $ 176 million in the value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as a pro@@ pane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last Friday , several failed attempts took place the first hear@@ ings of the Supreme Court .
the brothers are now strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , have been excluded .
Colin argu@@ ed that this was not true , but Paul introduces himself to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was handed in Colin , he says he was hoping to join the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies such as Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants and delic@@ ac@@ iers , operated in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Bruns@@ wick during the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , which was opened in Colin the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says he began West@@ co in the last years when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis said that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , gave their property to their sons .
Luigi &apos;s often told me that he never wanted to landing the brothers before the court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , but Colin claimed that Mark had paid $ 10 million in the company and had paid a $ 26 million dollar .
both Luke and Mark are , &quot; says Paul , &quot; talked about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made himself very rest@@ rained , although he was a former AF@@ L management board and after a biography in 2015 Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax media took touch with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin made by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts .
&quot; it is very sad , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved in the future of the dishes , &quot; wrote Colin .
the new Chief of Staff Tr@@ um@@ ps plans to limit the media coverage of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it actually .
if so , it will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first working day with conducting employees , he established a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he wants to repair : poor information that fall into the hands of the president .
Kelly said the staff that information should take over him - whether on paper or in mail@@ ings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagnostics makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame the bull by monitor his media device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when the candidate is delayed because of an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was to convince a fair reporting of places , &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against POL@@ IT@@ ICO .
Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it is under control , according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ amed praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; was &quot; under control , &quot; is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps these struggle , we know what we don &apos;t know , that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets wouldn &apos;t contain any more ignition on their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff had made it a few times , troubles him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent jun@@ k contro@@ versy .
part of the problem is that people in a white house , which are competing for competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by present Tr@@ ump material , which may potentially promote their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , due to the president of strategic reasons .
this was an example written by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press parts , especially those with dam@@ aging le@@ aks , and that he can find out how these origin@@ ate from .
this happened at the end of February , when someone viol@@ ently accused the president of a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson was banned because of ch@@ ik@@ anas permanently from Twitter , or that he has no more specific evidence , or that he expressed in the past false accus@@ ations and resi@@ sted them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ mann added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager , as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors are still under influence .
this un@@ changeable factors do the Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
the Master Rec@@ ei@@ ving Re@@ crimin@@ als get Post of Europ@@ ol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hope .
the police in all over Europe stran@@ ded in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ in crimin@@ als are not well @-@ known , indications from the population are hoping and to pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday of the promotion , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; - Adv@@ ent calendar from the winter .
the experiences had shown that many vol@@ atile and holiday dest@@ in@@ ations hide , it was called Europ@@ ol .
you &apos;ve compiled 21 postcards to selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website was www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ell , more than 2.5 million times this time has been viewed .
36 of the online application could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ th series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of West Mid@@ lands are again negotiated with some det@@ ective travelers on the war , which have negotiated a field before their men &apos;s houses .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the Million@@ th series .
they brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after they were dropped out in May , but had been deported by one from the jun@@ ta in order to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed her vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted to find a way .
residents have pressed the Council of Soli@@ hull , which said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous dw@@ eller said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced through shame on the implementation , since he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the traveler were there in May , were moved and returned now .
more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to keep , in order to protect their parks in order to protect their parks .
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my common dest@@ iny , if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a resident who was not called to be called , said , &quot; It is ridic@@ ulous we have just seen the last round of these trav@@ ellers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and they even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
as a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said , &quot; We are aware of an un@@ f@@ ug@@ ed bearing on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary legal steps , so that they could continue as fast as possible .
to support our mobility collection , it is very important that as many people are suffering a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture from the situation where the court has to check , when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being re@@ opened and is scheduled to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ence company Gesellschaft mbH back to 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year lost , and also revenues by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , the numbers of refugees that came in the district were offered as a collection room for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the creation of a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council at that time .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ ko &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house at that time .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the Three @-@ Stars @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at previous Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof are already a period of building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were detached , ceilings to partly dismant@@ led , ancient tubes are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is much to do until March .
it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be re@@ done in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area will be re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
all should be &quot; fair natur@@ g@@ ern@@ ah &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer emerg@@ es .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities .
it would not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in foli@@ age @-@ bad , but at a higher level of inner level , Sch@@ erer is st@@ resses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is set to look broad , expl@@ aining further .
both vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people will feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are equal with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to set up properly .
it is estimated under a million euros .
the external systems are also applied to front , this is already clearly visible .
there is a large terrace in a courtyard , which is open to public , accessible by the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Jury Prize
in the Russia affair , US President Donald Tr@@ ump is alleged to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury by Special Representative Robert Mu@@ eller after a report .
the panel has recorded the work in the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; referring to the point of trusted people .
the newspaper accounts the step as characters that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensi@@ fy its investigations .
the broad@@ caster CNN reported that there is already the first pre @-@ loading of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence service acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller is examined whether they were refer@@ enced between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
in the investigations of the investigations , several men are expected to ag@@ grav@@ ate the election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ um@@ ps of private and corporate environment among the magni@@ fying glass .
the Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Representative of Tr@@ ump would personally come into the centre and seek the accus@@ ation , whether the President may hin@@ der the judi@@ ces in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to prove and decide the evidence in possible inter@@ rup@@ tions and decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are also called anch@@ ov@@ ing chambers .
generally it is turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the board can also be turned on by the Public Prosec@@ ution in order to obtain persons under oath .
according to the station CNN , already pre @-@ loading tests were issued to turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps counsel@@ ors and s@@ wimm@@ ers J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his friendly election manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking to the discussion .
right experts said on Thursday night in US television that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller does not inter@@ act in his work and that he should be necessary quickly .
however , it had to be promised that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of a charge .
nevertheless , the en@@ forcement of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the Democrats a possibility to feel &quot; feel good because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he did not know any of the suspension of a Grand Jury .
this , however , usually work in the hearing , he stressed .
the White House endor@@ sed any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent on &quot; fair &quot; way .
the earlier FBI boss James Com@@ ey told three times that not against the president .
one has no reason to accept that something has changed , and it was stated in the explanation .
it was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
because of this ration@@ ality , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became loud , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June , before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to investigate his investigation against the then national security adviser to Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material on special agent and his staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is dismissed .
unlike an independent special agent of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller is a position in which he could be fired on cr@@ ush the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but prevention .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators were arrested on Thursday , after which the special agent could not be released so easily .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ice mountain takes off in the Antarc@@ tic
in the western Arctic the gigantic ice berg has replaced by almost seven times the size of Berlin@@ s by the Sch@@ el@@ hüt@@ s .
this is the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large f@@ lowed now to the north and probably will need two , three years until it is melted .
with 175 kilometres long and width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest king@@ doms , who registered the researchers in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
in the extent of climate change a role played at the demol@@ ition of the Ice Age , it is un@@ clear to the research data .
in total , however , there have been an unusual mer@@ c@@ tures of unusual so@@ aps in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ simile background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the frac@@ tional colleague had so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hüt@@ s so far .
Shr@@ ub@@ s swimming in the sea and is fed by great gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks up regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hüt@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ at was the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort in a couple of years .
a complete s@@ ham was crushed there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I speak a lot for it that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ yo@@ s is in danger because the front edge has never been so far withdrawn as at present .
in addition , the ice plate stand under tension and can be crushed , if a piece of key canc@@ els .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and ice@@ berg increases the sea level , as they swim on the water and ice as much water as it yields to the melting itself .
however , the loss of the mold means that the gl@@ ac@@ iers are directly into the sea , and can flow much faster than before .
this could increase the level of sea level , however , only in a low degree , writes the British research project to ob@@ serving Antarc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ holidays is the fourth biggest of the Antarc@@ tica for A@@ WI @-@ related information , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and conscious of us no direct link to climate change , the iron sign now comes into an endangered position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed .
under schol@@ ars may be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ holidays will now grow again and possibly reverse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this trend will take decades .
even though this researcher did not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg do not lead to climate change , so in the past few decades , many ice cubes have been crushed in the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula .
this long sk@@ irts of the Antarc@@ tic extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the past 50 years , counting the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CDU plans house rate in personnel
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy freely @-@ end positions , the CDU , out of the employer association will join in order to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag 41 has gained new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind .
the apprenti@@ ce in circle are obviously very sought @-@ in .
about 620 applications were registered for this year .
nevertheless , we lack the circle further staff to tackle the A@@ sc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
at the moment there are M@@ ett@@ mann county as far as 50 un@@ occupied places .
amongst others , doctors and engineers and the forces of general administration are sought .
the CDU would like to hold the initiative in common with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG initiative and compet@@ ed in the management team .
under the request of the parties , the administration is to provide a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term requirements of professionals , but future orient@@ ated by the applicant &apos;s short@@ age , says it .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate oneself within the inside and outside , include concrete action for cross @-@ entry and an apprentices@@ hip initiative , call CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advertising good officials and employees , offering more attractive terms .
the speech is a real &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related products comes from the service .
so it is best time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ owned .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint request with his party .
he already picked up already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a thick surprise when he publicly presented the personnel cost @-@ covered , and the other parties seem amazing .
people want all the options to be checked , enabling a outlet from the municipal employers association .
&quot; if we are not able to get a satisfactory solution here , the county government should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the circular cities - a pet &apos;s rate , &quot; says peoples .
with this , the CDU , the employees and officials have to pay better , as it is intended for the opening of the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed right now , increases , or more money , if you move into a higher level that takes care of vocational years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown steadily over the past few years .
just a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO Mig@@ rants rescue boot
Italy has been using NGOs who use life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they are not allowed to continue their new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa .
Min@@ n@@ itis War@@ ning a day after the Italian authorities were conf@@ is@@ cated by the German aid agency &apos; Youth R@@ isen &apos; , because their team had worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that the illegal immigration was em@@ itted .
the aid organisation that has been in operation only since one year , refused to express itself extensively of the Italian government Ambro@@ gio Cart@@ o@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can judge all the accus@@ ations that are currently charged , after we have collected all the information and jud@@ ging the situation . &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , who has been monitoring since October .
it is assumed that his crew will take rubber boats on board , which will be delivered directly from human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive them , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of these compositions have supposedly found only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the no@@ des of the Italian media , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to compl@@ ain about the authority of Italian coast @-@ guards , rescue operations in the zone made of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .

asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Sea , to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly guides are available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ este of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took hot summer temperatures along the vineyard Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there are viewing spots , partly at towers , of which one could look far above the Pf@@ ister Forest , and the prev@@ ailing levels .
there was again longer bur@@ dening , for which long Tri@@ als are rewarded .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival .
again , view point to look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ ps , &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate institutions .
on the last two days , many alt@@ itudes were accumulated again .

after 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Woods from its best side - sports and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equi@@ ps for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future sit on computer consol@@ es , rather than strug@@ gling through the wind and weather on the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high speeds .
this also recognized the first federal lig@@ aver@@ ages that are increasingly engaged in this field .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , followed in the beginning of July 2015 , followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; we hope to inspire the new young target groups to V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
it is certain that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot;
on the next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; to compete in the gam@@ er of various clubs .

and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian countries .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men , one could even be present on these markets online as only once a year the federal government will send to Asia .
why is it exactly ?
in the E @-@ Sport games , computer games like &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA simulation of FIFA on a competitive level .
they have long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ es established , in which the professionals are competing against each other .
and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe in need .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ina has also dealt long with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport , for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
besides , it need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is always more and more &quot; d@@ oping . &quot;
controls are hard @-@ tra@@ ce@@ able during online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
scientists raises the high integral effects of E @-@ Sports .
players are international on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural events .
a study by management consultants Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a fast growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros has been implemented in Germany , mainly advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tour@@ neys .
in three years , sales are expected to grow at 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little .
however , the E @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
International , many countries are already continuing .
great markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .

in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league &apos;s soccer league , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to al@@ ign an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany wins , &quot; V@@ f@@ B Executive Board explains R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the ancient times to clari@@ fy , today isn &apos;t enough anymore .
it is about preser@@ ving the tradition of the association , but the company is to host the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a dig@@ iti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , being executed by Conrad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by lyrics and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed on par@@ ole .
in June , Carter was convicted of neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide of Conrad Roy , which took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unlimited .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argue that both it and Mr Roy has been working on a psychological illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ use , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down , when they were condemned .
&quot; their actions were killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosecutor in court .
she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said .
&quot; it has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attor@@ ney said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she has completely regre@@ ts . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or Rei@@ f@@ eg@@ rad , or even their mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a prosecutor read a statement about Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said it was not a day when I am not the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will never be followed by knowledge , &quot; that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or his aun@@ t his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a right preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit suicide in order to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case moved in national attention after car@@ ters reveal text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages sent to his death in the two weeks before his death was on vacation .
in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you have to do is open to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press of the case .
the legal opinion has divided the legal opinion .
to the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in Italy for murder of their British co @-@ resident in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed as captain at the Audi Cup , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tru@@ sts the Con@@ stant @-@ Cup winner for a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
anything was different at his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even when the extra piece was very , very small .
but as far as wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups did not match Philipp L@@ ame and there was no Manuel new one , he made him stri@@ ped ties to the arm .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; the Con@@ fig @-@ Cup winner came back after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ captain .
good , the int@@ ent could have been better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from coach could also signi@@ fy what .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was born in youth players , de@@ but@@ aries and just out of vacation that are chosen by the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a leader , but he .
Su@@ gar@@ l is distributed among those who want to give a lot to those who want to keep in mood .
whoever has to explo@@ res the sign of L@@ ame , can only use a small payment motivation for only good use .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; that is what man wants to do as a player : &quot; take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took over the field as Mini @-@ L@@ ame .
right back , this is now its position , the white binding on the arm did its rest .
and , at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this starting formation , such as the one who can take the Ru@@ der at best .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy themselves .
Vi@@ dal is thus that his lack of fitness to play ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato san@@ itation to slip on the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver to wake up their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
nevertheless , it worked all well .
in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y ran off the def@@ ende , both worked well .
the renowned Nap@@ oli storm often did so hard , moreover , Sü@@ ver tried to get a few times successful in the building .
his colleague Rud@@ y revealed that the result was &quot; not so , as we hop@@ ed it . &quot;
but even he showed a regular performance at the end .
game deposit , speed change : &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot;
how un@@ familiar this Bavaria world still is for new@@ com@@ ers , one looked after the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , gave the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few succ@@ essive statements on his new recording .
there he heard of Sü@@ ver an interesting proposition : &quot; what happens here I have already noticed .
with Bavaria you must simply win each game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one .

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate ministers : Economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ mar Tempo
it was often un@@ reconc@@ iled , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Economic Affairs Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , president of the association Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ t@@ wende sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country now .
still in this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the building is expected .
the West is also a role in the plans of the country , as well as the West surro@@ unds of the country .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says Minister for Education Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post in it to support regional but international competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) , as inspired by knowledge , in the wine a Rheinland @-@ Pfalz label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German exports since ten years .
moreover , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to start your own company , the I@@ HK comm@@ ends .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier looks at the new Master Bonus an additional incenti@@ ve for young apprenti@@ ces , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the master examination and 2,500 euros , if graduates within 10 years after the master school is self @-@ confident .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
there are quick facts in the planned road construction , at the same time , the country says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , which plans to adjust knowledge about mobility , have only been occupied at 29 locations until now .
the I@@ HK calls for to award more jobs at external offices .
CDU faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the host , the country will be investing more than 20 million euros in advance of the country roads by 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the lack of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is further the old full range of broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the 3.4 rating .
it compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and breaks .
former Minister of Economic Affairs Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits in the wind farm company Pro Wind .
the Green Party left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where it was already spatial again after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers see itself confron@@ ting with a counter@@ reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer the software update to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW MEP said the company is the opinion that &quot; there is more intelligent options as driving constra@@ ints , &quot; and thus went to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based on diesel cars .
at Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the company described the companies as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon emissions .
but nitrogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines em@@ it , are regarded as carcin@@ ogens and may cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles sold out exhaust gases are also available , too , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the company try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called auto @-@ devices that could regulate the rules when a car has been tested , but rest@@ rained in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former leader of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics were arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be put to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi became involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen . after the authorities of Audi acc@@ use a system to deal with the legislation in Europe , and an inquiry that focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer is disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ ning los Kn@@ ights and laughter to the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was always one of the most widely published cartoon animation , the Kn@@ ights of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argentin@@ ian audience still shows and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
during the first years as an artist , he proved himself among others as a character for gambling cards - which was fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris ended up at the end of the 60s of the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again , the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures are located in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting on drawing , today almost ten hours daily .
about cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches are still finding many pieces worldwide .
he has been working on an animation and a TV series for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ deca@@ los any popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should be coming to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ t in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what to say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the screen@@ play is not written by him .
this is why it uses more to the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced .
lavender from Provence , threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lavender is due to dro@@ ught of dro@@ ught conditions and due to the disease @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find great heada@@ ches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effective , because the plant in the past years was exposed to climate change , which has brought much rain in spring and much more .
this has imp@@ lications for the life span of lavender .
there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that we@@ ars the d@@ warf , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot on the game .
lavender oil is not only attracted to holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of doing very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions that are considered into account include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties , which are more resistant to dry .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thuring@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1,200 @-@ year existence .

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist emphas@@ izes the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the youngest chaos in the state of S@@ inal@@ oa , organised crime , corrupt civil servants and in@@ ational drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was informed to them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or to leave them at home .
safety experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ r@@ ale , ally .
they ask rep@@ orters , names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal perc@@ ep@@ tions .
there are drug ad@@ missions , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ el , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico .
there is no break from violence , and while all the country breaks out , there are more journalists . at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , as President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , have been in office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 have been under attack and threats under federal protection and now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is their editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
his absence will feel deep , though its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle finger on the front of the Ri@@ o@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts who are sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ anian .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ epl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although it was established in 2010 by an Austrian Foreign Office in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only led to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , each year involving drug dealers and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely tried by journalists .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still pers@@ ist to treat the violence of S@@ inal@@ oa , although they are not comfor@@ ting , even though the terrain is still tra@@ itor .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid , my time to waste in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we do not know why , we susp@@ ect to all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15th Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was shot by two men . he was shot and shot at him for 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper , which is &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the shooter drove out in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to travel around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an free .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing to silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extradition of the United States in January , S@@ inal@@ oa became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it makes nothing that anyone can be shot at S@@ inal@@ oa every day or several people on the road , or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of t@@ oned , two @-@ story maus@@ ol@@ een for drug @-@ ro@@ wers who are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bors and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
initially , in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions held in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans .
this publication may have off@@ ended the sons , sp@@ illed gear@@ boxes delivered every copy of the output when she was delivered to newspaper c@@ os@@ ks .
the second error was that Val@@ dez was not forced to force her , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country at its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he served as experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined the Ri@@ odo@@ ce &apos;s five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars involved .
in S@@ inal@@ oa , &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without entering the r@@ d@@ ote problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time , the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ age@@ ous and honest reporting , and the sales and the advertising increased .
rep@@ orters loved it , hard tre@@ ading investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by one publication that they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; Cab@@ ot Prize for its reporting in Latin America .
in that same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican Drug History , wherever they lead .
he gave up voluntarily , that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live further , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug dealers in S@@ inal@@ oa &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October .
&quot; you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either this or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ ce team missing Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse the friend who was generous with h@@ ug@@ s and counsel@@ ings , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always be to El Guay@@ ama , the bar opposite the office and sit there on the same table there .
now they ask : was his love for the routine ?
his death has also forced them to ask her own ass@@ ump@@ tions on how they can do their job done and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ efficiency and self @-@ preser@@ vation .
trust his own Inst@@ alled .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , get away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happened . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , in S@@ inal@@ oa , no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones were allowed . days before , sp@@ y@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in joke , some of the writers asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described the governor itself as not trusted .
it is months ago since the rep@@ orters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug ad@@ missions are actually under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has picked three main stories .
there was the assassination of the el@@ dest brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in S@@ inal@@ oa .
they also had an exile to the public spending that focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that led to Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favourite locally from drug dealers and authorities .
one reporter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politicians who ruled the ruling institutional Revolution party ( pr@@ i ) which ruled nearly all the century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about former inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man passed a military attack .
just a few months earlier , readers would have watched the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source on the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; before that we knew what has happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender corporation .
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and st@@ icker , dedicated to the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the staff have become something they never expected - activists in the press name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ app@@ ed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist at the Office of the State Prosec@@ ution .
Salvador Ad@@ ame van@@ ished three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
throughout the country , journalists have become stronger , as they have written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking and building sites .
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Val@@ dez @-@ case .
at a meeting with the governor of S@@ inal@@ oa on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to prop@@ elled journalists and bring it into the truth because they have said the truth .
she has been asked since that she has been divided by the government , because she &apos;s concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organic crimes , involved in government officials and an equally valid society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug traff@@ icking , but also on orders from politicians and security forces that a@@ woke up with the organized crime under a blanket .
the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks allocated to journalists of the police and officials last year .
&quot; in Mexico , you die , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said .
obviously the murders have a deter@@ ring effect .
nobody forgotten the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that allegedly was signed by Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones , in addition to their separate head .
some stores have chosen such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assassination of the correspon@@ dents of MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do like El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , following the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez introduces himself publicly to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their homeland , or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it was revealed by the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poets , gives the drug dealers to frigh@@ ten him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was rep@@ orters , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already completed , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all started to sum@@ ming up their phones .
a series of shooting paintings with band@@ ages and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ bassies in the region .
from the on@@ stone can@@ on , they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , who held the watch to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
among the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all the S@@ inal@@ oa , followed by Ri@@ odo@@ ce &apos;s vest@@ iges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies
it looks like a statue , like a statue .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well preserved that experts have described it as a &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his fl@@ ak@@ y skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the best @-@ held arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossil is a newly discovered sort of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has researchers to describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ aters is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Shawn radio when he died on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he hit something that was missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look closer .
the F@@ ossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blind a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; it will go into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ riere . &quot;
researchers found that this vegetable f@@ ress@@ er , although it is covered with arm@@ or , and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by flesh cre@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves from rob@@ ber@@ y , and used a par@@ atro@@ opers , which is also known as counter@@ feit detection , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix well into its environment and to sof@@ ten his enemies , experts tell us that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild animal and called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli to the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preser@@ vation of the specimen enabled it by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ aments about his body .
they discovered the cas@@ ket , a widespread defence method in animal rich@@ ly , which means that the top of the creation was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the denom@@ inations are common , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals today living .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by in@@ solven@@ cy din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution Blo@@ cked the con@@ frontation with the con@@ frontation of the con@@ frontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the consol@@ ation sha@@ dows - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ b@@ als - are much smaller and vulner@@ able than prey , which signals that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ cked din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ni@@ vo@@ res must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red .
scientists still examine the animal on the evidence of his life , including his fourth generation , to figure out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs died when he died , caught up into a river and cast into the sea where it sank on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ as today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ated skin , but it remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal &quot; says Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
you don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only catch a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe he &apos;s going to sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that stood on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its fur@@ tive ancestors .
this is one of the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes heavier monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the ocean and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Shawn radio when he died on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle until the hips .
the creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ik@@ es , which ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant e@@ aters has been sha@@ ken by western Canada until a flooded river was flooded in the open sea .
but the underwater exploration of the din@@ osau@@ rs ruled his arm@@ or in exquisite item detail .
the rem@@ nant remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin remains still hol@@ low tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the lot@@ to .
the more I ans@@ er it , the more conf@@ using it .
the remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , its five fingers crossed over .
I can count the sheds on his sole &apos; .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass hor@@ se@@ age .
there are numerous convic@@ ts , mile long st@@ akes - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A8 ) , there are approximately 20 men injured in the late Thursday afternoon of Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock there were between the connection positions Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm just under 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , domestic vehicles .
no details on the exact number of injured persons were first given at first .
they were mild to moderate serious injuries , said police officers .
a large number of life @-@ vehicles was on the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in Munich .
the journey in Munich formed a approximately ten @-@ kilometre return ride .
like a AZ reporter , it was also on the counter @-@ way to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the attributes of the vehicle workers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive imp@@ etus .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock the second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
and there was a coll@@ ision between a car park and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter has been on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps .
or one is pl@@ ung@@ ed into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : exhaust .
the conductor and w@@ akes a fro@@ g or ri@@ ps the rides in the middle of the workflow .
tickets control .
but the times of the breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ i@@ ded the major ticket inspection .
just confirm by mobile phone that you should be taken at his place and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , wide we are from .
it will likely be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote @-@ travel routes in Germany , &quot; said a train speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is the railway card recycling without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to use it , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - what already the most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased via the railway station , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking .
and finally , you need a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Ticket . &quot;
with the test clients , then a button for the electronic recovery will appear .
the train atten@@ dant receive a message on their mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is in turn and taken the booked seat .
the train atten@@ dant at No. Y knows he knows there is a passenger with already off @-@ value online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to use the passenger in turn .
&quot; if you want to get your ticket to your train ticket through our train companion , check out the DB Navigator .
this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management of DB correspondence .
second plus : &quot; and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
who runs on train , knows that in addition to delay and pas@@ modi@@ fying trains , the ticket insp@@ ect include the biggest trouble .
because often , in any case , one of the fellow travelers don &apos;t have all documents that you need to dev@@ alu@@ ation of online tickets .
either missing the credit card or identity card or any document you need to quote .
the result are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and Fahr@@ enheit , which leads to a bad mood in the waste part or wholesale and del@@ ays in control of their own tickets and the conductor at the end of time taking care of other concerns .
still only a small number of test clients can use the new service .
and this is also available on the links between ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ roll@@ ed by Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police has just killed an 18 year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; said it .
per@@ ple@@ xed , since nobody had posted the information on her feed , she graduated Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was saved continuously on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the St. Louis area was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , twe@@ eter .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns &apos;s le@@ f@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; I thought out Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her mobile phone to twe@@ ets later on the evening to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of police tape and people , cried , and a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ y@@ ho@@ und dog .
in another video , she said that another polic@@ eman secured his rif@@ le and cried : &quot; I &apos;ll all kill you ... &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her testimony .
&quot; it is not the type of murder , which we have used to us and that we can call it typical . &quot;
in this moment I felt shi@@ vers .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she repeated her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival , love and loss , strength and loss of resistance , which consists of the perspective of people who live in community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell ran with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two have a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; do you remember how black people have to fight for this , what do they believe in ? &quot; they remembered what she said .
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police had killed 18 @-@ year @-@ old boys and that was not right .
I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a cli@@ max of what happened in the past .
it must know , and it must be drawn up and log@@ ged .
it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves .
even though I am lucky to give you an experience in which they personally experience any ek@@ lat@@ ent rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black female child .
I feel that I would as@@ sign a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a village opposite the police station , which was at a camp site , as the activists on the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on protest@@ ers .
slowly began a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the Organ@@ izer .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by people of people , often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had co @-@ operated with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around the death of death .
his commitment brought about Fer@@ rell &apos;s project closer together with six other loc@@ als followed the team from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because so I shall be represented . &quot;
the aim was to concentrate on Fer@@ ra@@ ls &apos;s experience - to demonstrate that it is a Messiah @-@ leader , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
consequently , documents are showing documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls , as she loves and marry her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; but I understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the publishing of black people . &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls is making the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who had marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identified as a weaker form in social media .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we fight permanently on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women have to wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an in@@ as@@ mati@@ an type of action , &quot; when the Fer@@ rell was chosen because of its identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook those energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , even though it was on the fore@@ front , because with a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the message cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell has been on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a Chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she kl@@ um@@ med to a song and she feels obliged to this memory , ever since she went three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the street .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and assist .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the South @-@ east of the pedestrian zone has been spar@@ ked the population in supporters and opponents in 2009 .
cold the topic is cold .
the subject is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one @-@ bit gallery says : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really class &quot; ( Nicole sigh@@ s ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply simply : &quot; size ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which the rest of the shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding .
additionally , the gallery will be located directly on the grounds , on which the farmers market hall is located , in which 13 directors offer their products .
the construction work will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - at the Bed@@ a square with a possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer &apos;s market for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the comp@@ atri@@ ots are always happy to come back .
we also discovered the but@@ cher for us too .
we would wish that even during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing are located in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of renting .
this should probably not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Ki@@ lic : &quot; what is the most shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , footwear , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough in our town .
you see how many shops stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is the more important that we at least keep the mark@@ thalle .
for all , the goods offered are fresh , mostly sold directly from the producer and is ob@@ taining to ob@@ end@@ lessly .
as you see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall only of larger firms , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a reta@@ iler .
it &apos;s a pity , special transactions there are almost no more and that of which is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle covered me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market stand during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery appears at some point .
or does it already manage to distribute all the shops out of Bit@@ burg before ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
to my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market , it &apos;s too many - as I find - sensu@@ al building projects in Bit@@ burg no more space anymore .
when the farmer &apos;s market hall was made , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang almost un@@ strange - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ Tu@@ es and hair sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former secret service analy@@ ti@@ cian con@@ founded a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after they publicly inc@@ ited diplomatic news on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was agreed to expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking discount , whose condem@@ nation by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his position .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and made out of the 30 portraits , such as someone can appear with these genom@@ ic data , a sharp if also some intellectual property could not only be interpreted , as they can be interpreted and inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Bradley Edward , has been openly spoken about the identification of the woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 prosec@@ ut@@ ors , including six violations of the spy act , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white strange , sitting in the man@@ ing seat un@@ comfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde sil@@ ver@@ - which was associated with her .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just returned from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette st@@ umm@@ el and chew@@ ing gum by extracts the DNA from waste to make a picture of what these people might look like .
this was the time that she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not take photographs , so she caught up contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were sent to un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ er@@ onds , which took several letters in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o &apos;s comic book &quot; Supp@@ lied Images , &quot; that would translate a future in which the President Chel@@ ach would translate and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings would release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads to war against in@@ forman@@ t from government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ ables , which he should actually fix , further to fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen out of a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , the artistic testimony called Mann@@ ing with her superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end to the &quot; automatic collapse , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence -@@ a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoping to show the involvement of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , how surprising , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , therefore 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in your own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic language .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it emerg@@ es with a free spins in the United States , as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; when they are cold out of your speech , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist who greet you from Philadelphia .
&quot; I always get ge@@ ese if I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally so as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but when she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks which are like Hor@@ ses of protest@@ ers .
it was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ etus were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement , which also raised after their liberation . &quot;
doctors of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human race is going on for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which had been sought for susp@@ ects , after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been stab@@ bed to death .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shows the acts of the Cook County Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , passed away after several bul@@ lets .
a special warning system published by the Chicago authority in Chicago , stating that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective examination as murder while the police is active after the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of the University of relations , said in an email statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been be@@ wit@@ ched now and excluded from the court of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates at this study , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man for the university and the Somer@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to assist the US investig@@ ative authorities in any possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanting to prove himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago authority in Chicago , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he needed to susp@@ ect the susp@@ ects on the authorities .
&quot; the police has an idea of her where@@ ab@@ ort , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national agencies can help finding the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building , who had just received a permanent tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim of a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police is currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible case . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA vehicle plan in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( WA@@ DA ) implemented for restoration of Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the schedule of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ d@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA vehicle plan was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ en@@ forcement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing what could have been concerned for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; added .
however , one of the criteria cited in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities authorised the findings of the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports .
referring to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation , as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has put an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit what does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled as part of D@@ oping sk@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA by di@@ oping control in Russia .
it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA general manager Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; moved to &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di sells no eggs more .
the division distributed the company groups .
it is a pure precau@@ tionary measure , unless otherwise assumed any health impair@@ ment , it was stated in the message .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , who have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative at fi@@ pro@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ buff@@ ets .
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls did not work .
responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; Er@@ rett , who manages the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .
she was called people from the outside .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is growing , in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the employees &apos;s involvement , it allows companies to provide surveys , speci@@ alization groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow C @-@ Suite executives to inter@@ act directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ rett said she has a better insight into what your staff think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ P@@ olls and P@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows most complaints and which managers have low participation results - so you can re@@ boot why .

for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this request is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option .

Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognise , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year ami@@ dst the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ t has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
An@@ u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t Companies will send tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; p@@ olls , collecting confi@@ dential responses to real @-@ time and view the warmth cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report to the employees of bad behavior .
and if the chief executive guide is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has collected the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that his staff will be po@@ or@@ ously treated or un@@ ethical , it may experience valuable consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures , and have a simple way to achieve its headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the headquarters , submit formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said it was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Conver@@ cent , problems , which were sitting in offices in cities or states , were hidden , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair practices - have been identified and addressed .
&quot; I can move closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; says Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in the employment of employment . &quot;
company started to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 to take advantage of the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen for ethical reasons through the Enron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; social media &quot; came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that you couldn &apos;t prevent their dirty clothes online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ t offer your software as service , and t@@ anning the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors , which both support start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ t received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured a $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his total funding to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than so far .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio businesses are doing well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the Analytics tools promise you to increase commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder you will find support .
the data on employees &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless when the company &apos;s car@@ et@@ aker take no measures .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , there is an anticip@@ ation that change on the path is .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appointments and staff can motiv@@ ate them .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , the company that has seen themselves to have reli@@ ed on the collection of data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and who do not care about it , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who is now through the monthly employee p@@ olls , was able to slide measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett .
and after the collection of feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
on Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights via employees , and it hopes for a long run , that leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is well @-@ known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; says Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose company .
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day to the brood
it starts up at 23 AM , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers are on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of silence on the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these two minutes make a lunch break .
players who are registered to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise in their final tests before they return at 6 : 30 on the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; that &apos;s the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday .
N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three courses of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 are beginning to meet the players already completed .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins post@@ pon@@ ed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time , during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood were conducting practical exercises .
they are expected to hold 18 exercises in August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their opening against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he support the code change of N@@ CAA , even if they added a further point in the many @-@ time routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply have pressed them , they er@@ ect , they are great people .
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished , resulting in view of the clear sight of its fields of an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class , which has already been run with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; it &apos;s a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up there to draw an exercise .
if you have the video from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not so worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to the fact reviewed by third parties and their results under the original contribution then indicate the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated maintenance methods to detect possible counter@@ feit detection and to indicate them at the fact checks , which may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been crit@@ ici@@ zed as one of the main part@@ itions for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe that they have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem also has become a great political issue in Europe , with the French elec@@ torate in the run up to the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany must be punished by the social media networks , if they were unable to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted postal ings as before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a review of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; besides the realization that stories of fact @-@ reviewed third parties are challenged , people want more context to make well @-@ founded decisions on what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to be able to test its feature &quot; in the link above , and in other changes to its news feed , to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history at the Main@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England stretches out time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it &apos;s not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the calendar pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a double ag@@ ger in the 1700 @-@ year @-@ old who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his Dau@@ ra@@ ction !
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as it would be as well .
Ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is defeated so with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have given my welcome offer a little over &quot; ) it seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days that the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to explore the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the Mongo@@ lian creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with agriculture partners , gar@@ dening partners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only given the full access in 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps that represent what possessed : &quot; one could mean that land@@ conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch that fought two families .
guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collections use the castle as a starting point to enter a bro@@ ader basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peas@@ ant rising from 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording from an u@@ pro@@ ar who appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &quot; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ ant stood in this field and I thought was an uprising was a good start .
perhaps they are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ tern that hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , presented in the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , filled his own funeral , filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his Sar@@ g was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney , saying : &quot; the masters seemed to be quite a b@@ aun@@ er , always make money back and spend money for things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ males del@@ ights their debt crisis by giving up the elderly women - I present them as a he@@ ap well worth looking guys , with a kn@@ ack to advert@@ ise land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rho@@ des fell in search of other unique writers .
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ ki behind herself , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been returned by nature again .
but Scot@@ ney took a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ on@@ elle is covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ um chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched her campaign for the introduction of a new roof @-@ brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team aims to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August , there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , we wonder the makers of the action yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on their yesterday website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that much better is than it seems .
in essence , we are the solid conviction that we know as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ ti@@ veness of our town very well . &quot;
the action puts it by more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan , so it means .
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise that gives the city a distinctive lik@@ able entity . &quot;
eventually they stand up in the competition with other municipalities .
the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can be adjusted for a mid @-@ term amount and cost the campaign .
military communication in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ ans fear of the Army
in early August , the Supreme National Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on retirement and transport in the officer of the officer .
so this week too .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the attempt attempt .
the meeting did not place more in general staff , as previously , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s office .
under the presidency of the government the five Vice Premier@@ s , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the survi@@ vor .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the forces of the Air Force and the Navy were shut down .
since the failed Cou@@ p , head of government Erd@@ ogan 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ y .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties on the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ ogan as a wire suspension of the coup attempt .
around 4@@ 86 people who have been involved immediately on the coup attempt will have been involved in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ ogan expected the revolution attempt to overthrow as &quot; religious gift &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to cleanse the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ ogan really handle the army in the handle ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the title &quot; Un@@ c@@ auti@@ ously in the military headquarters . &quot;
the general staff give it concerns about an increasing &quot; Islamic Emirate &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the raising of the head@@ band for solo institutions , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the bulk soli@@ ds in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ ogan was fired by decree another 73@@ 95 polic@@ eman , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers .
it seemed , as Erd@@ ogan was t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times her calling on her role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ ogan urged the power of the military step back to step , not least in appeal to the reform proposal of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ ogan is implementing a Islam@@ ist armed forces .
in the &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a prominent officer , who sought refuge for the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , NATO could not let such an impact on Nato .
in the alliance , there are doubts in the Alliance according to pur@@ ification of the Turkish Army .
the management structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited from the media .
he sees to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 a year ago , stric@@ ter rules for allowing vis@@ as of Visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will stop the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will benefit from , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wishes to san@@ ze circuit for race @-@ enh@@ ancing
over the past months , the future of the race @-@ enh@@ sh@@ utt@@ les had been fought over the past few months - now it is supposed to be fast .
at the end of the year , the tourist lines should be built , on which the tourist area is going to be built .
to secure the future of the race @-@ enh@@ ancing end long term , according to the transport of the Ministry of Transport , we will begin construction on the route this year .
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ es continue to order and san@@ itation , the country is particularly important for the tourism key , &quot; stated traffic secretary of Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt .
the cost of the main@@ ten@@ ment of the route charges it to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , which should be ordered to be ordered by the Shuttle in the future of the country , will be officially coordinated , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as operators can agree on the technical details .
&quot; thus , the tim@@ etable , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said .
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
to order the race @-@ run @-@ Shuttle will be ordered separately on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ es @-@ Shuttle is one especially popular rail link between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
in the course of a pilot licence , in the course of a pilot licence , many people have been used to order them again regularly .
the circuit is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought there will be no more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex @-@ robot is currently a great deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; people make themselves funny about it , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; says Mr. Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report .
modern rop@@ es have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots using a silicone skin , which feels warm @-@ up - with consci@@ ously human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can adapt to its robot even correspon@@ d@@ ingly to its beliefs &quot; and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still worried , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would release a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive .
modern s@@ ut@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots using a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt to its users to adjust their robot to the properties that they are appe@@ aling , for example rel@@ ap@@ sing .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of rel@@ tern@@ ess , and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; swe@@ eping the website of True Compan@@ ion .
this is what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her m@@ oods throughout the day - just as real people !
she can be tired , to be fixed in conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects with this rise of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female properties called rape when you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is concerned , in@@ tran@@ qui@@ l one most .
true on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or simply just another sex toys .
her emergence and increasing refin@@ ement show something dark and deeper in our culture , at a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes , to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition .
most men , of course , are not having sex robots , and while FR@@ R not@@ ices their rising popularity , they still remain at the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what was le@@ ak@@ ened out of the edge zones , in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange , or offensive , until they have given the free market for this .
there is however a certain persu@@ asive that this highly developed sex @-@ robot in a time emerge in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there has been a president in the White House who practic@@ ed women are sexually attacked .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos;s &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the closed body and an out@@ stretched eye , but how realistic this vision appears .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a large jump .
the goal behind this sex @-@ robot is to make a physical resem@@ bl@@ ance on actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their peas want it to be human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robot constitute no real wives .
you cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away .
they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that could inter@@ fere with independence or anything which could inter@@ fere with imagination .
to be expressed differently : you are fake slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ th@@ ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of whol@@ es@@ ome human lives
it has become a binding period of the dump of the Tr@@ ump era that the political circuits that have the U.S. voters being kept pol@@ arized , also families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest festival there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump eating .
we are all supposed to meet us , in order to burst out our filter bub@@ bles .
less not@@ icing is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families united .
I will mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ wing gas@@ ket that lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a mighty effect .
with ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same page .
in order to get the dining table , this certainly is a good thing , but it falls in a further context that there is also significant risks .
the left hand was reinforced by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to move forward to the right .
if we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ass@@ al chance that we will no longer pass away his cookies of one day .
there is , however , a troubled long @-@ term scenario , in which the Rep@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gic for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ti@@ ous version of dec@@ ay - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - which occurs in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact as a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally sound to qualify as an in@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York car department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ammed and the animals are turning to watch full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the delicious music . this gives a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage , the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not part - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sel is still a strange experience since two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I had given the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked him .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on my street it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but exercise pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood di@@ li@@ gently , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the jail for a hospital for the second time .
in the past year , he was brought to the hospital for having suffered his hands to the hospital , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death by murder after murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ iss@@ ile in the early morning of the summer of 2013 , putting them several times by a door of the toilet in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claims that he held his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al int@@ ru@@ der which in the cabin hidden .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence from Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , by which they say that she was too late .
the National prosecution authority said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ug@@ s came from fen@@ ders and cher@@ ubs into the school and went into the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to gymn@@ asium on high school , four at the High School .
chief teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental Mayor in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grows in poultry , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar brought a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the chicken farm . &quot;
peas@@ ant Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken , a small e@@ agles came out .
but the hope , out of it a chicken , struck the e@@ agles spread its wings on a high mountain , and broke out .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yv@@ onne Frank .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder wore to the bet .
the eagle stand for integration , said school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young man may be different than the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished to wish everyone four @-@ v@@ ug@@ ly that he feels himself in his new school .
many thanks a letter to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who has always joined the lessons of teaching , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the cooking time was now over , the class@@ room Sophia Schumacher explained .
she won &apos;t leave her students after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time .
eventually she can rely on the vier@@ lander .
as a conclusion , all students experienced a song of summer time and tourist season .
in doing so great joy broke out in the children .
eight months are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illegal detention was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released , while currently a study expi@@ res .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians was released later .
the Greek authorities have covered control over the free camp@@ sites and place to anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not responsible for this purpose .
controls will continue throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court may be a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected must now know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the campaign ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
with the diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total .
they are expected to improve emission classes of Euro 5 and some of the Euro 6 emission classes .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates before apply only for the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin .
the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered their re@@ armament .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a fast implementation in the next few months , but not an exact date .
Daimler has informed us to write every person concerned .
if an inspection will be due , that will be done in their frames .
how long can the equipment come up ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin says .
the hang@@ ings of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment , as well as of political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen that the deal@@ er@@ ship did not deal with the environment on the subject of environment . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself might take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be a date to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE will fear that .
but just in the regions where driving people are threatening .
in rural area there are no value loss for older diesel .
the ACE advis@@ es to wait for sale .
ll Cool J to receive Kennedy Center Award

the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) .
handed over are the awards early December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania on the awar@@ ding .
the winners of the progressive TV series are announced by the winners of L@@ ear to aband@@ on participation in the gala .
he said &quot; The New York Times &quot; said : &quot; this presidency has decided to completely neglec@@ t the arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to declare her visibility .

we make the city lively
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ master , goes into retirement in the coming year .
the site is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker City Building has been in charge for 31 years .
and the work still does great fun , as he communic@@ ates in the press interview .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that no application has been fulfilled for the requirement profile .
the city is seeking an architect or Civil Engine@@ er at the next possible time .
thus , under the contemp@@ t of regular cancellation @-@ periods - still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach was employed to serve the board of administration as a sub@@ ordin@@ ator authority , the applicant must point to the agreement .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they could not fill up this anymore , citizens would have to leave for consultation until Offen@@ burg .
but Bür@@ g@@ ern@@ ä@@ ger@@ m was the city and himself important , says W@@ acker who reported from a good operating climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated , on the che@@ ers looking back with pride .
&quot; we make the city worth seeing , &quot; it is safe in the building department and its employees .
but also in the future , varied projects are standing on the agenda : the re@@ shaping of former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Lower Hall Square are around .
the pup@@ il bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium is still a theme .
the latter alone is the latter with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates h@@ ack@@ ers .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here makes fun . &quot;
be compulsory for a city council in large games room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener &apos;s own site can be re@@ acted in many respects .
&quot; people can move much , &quot; so w@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of the green plants is often comm@@ end@@ able by citizens and visitors .
since the old town as ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; to have an eye for it , &quot; if new@@ builds are approved , &quot; the def@@ ending city builder .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ master carries high responsibility .
he is a building , &quot; at the end it runs all over my table . &quot;
he is able to count on many long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ay@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been around for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identify and stay with the place . &quot;
for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if he wants to bury Roland W@@ acker , it should be admitted to the city of Has@@ lach as a graduate studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with technical direction of architecture and have good expertise in the sectors of building and construction .
the municipal office sub@@ ordin@@ ates high and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ growth issues , management of urban property , urban farming of building yard and gar@@ dening equipment , as well as sub @-@ construction administration , including monument protection .
cast a bike on pipes : crossing the south route
according to the police , previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged , that the her@@ eto@@ ed freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and are looking for their night hours after them .
several witnesses had been observed close to the Tat@@ ort by witnesses and a bicycle driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the perpet@@ rators were brought to danger even in great danger and at risk of accessibility .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the facility as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport , the railway customers can also benefit to the perpet@@ rators .
to be out of a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said .
the damage were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the railway line could be led without disabilities .
almost ten persons were out of Friday afternoon , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains dropped out , but they didn &apos;t delay delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged some 200 metres of s@@ itt@@ ings .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( Flamm@@ able intest@@ ines )
red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based protein and dairy products could be the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able condition which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States , affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and blin@@ dness , recur@@ ring or bloody fail@@ ures , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the suffer@@ ings , meat and dairy products have come to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of protein found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of protein found that promote immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the conducting researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in the food , do not enter into the body .
cells , which are capable of resolved inflammation , promote inflammation , promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues .
when the equilibrium is too far in direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
experiments were observed that a kind of tolerance convey@@ ing immun@@ cell in mice came from having a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ate .
and the bacter@@ ium is needed tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of protein - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their diet , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an rich nutrition toler@@ ate , less infl@@ atable colo@@ rec@@ y exercises when the same system can work with people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate of Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was seeking a kind of immune cell that encour@@ ages tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers such cells had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separated , but had not .
it assumes that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oming of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were mounted in a sterile environment that they lack@@ ed a gut micro@@ bi@@ om and had not developed this type of immune cells , and they were created the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria looked on the immune system , the researchers sent L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid , then resulted in small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ borne cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleaned out , it turned out as a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the food of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ability convey@@ ing cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i are protecting from our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an ad@@ ore products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The evolution of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can result in an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the Chelsea &apos;s 40 million pound signed from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup @-@ Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and took only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve that he had to improve the Premier League season before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent Le@@ aked in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had wished for three more prefer@@ ments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already performed a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four priority new@@ bor@@ ns to fulfil .
&quot; three out of four , thanks to the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dre@@ am@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of an Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and went to the form of an Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the promotion took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar monitors , the shape of an Dre@@ am@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertis@@ ements .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
new b@@ ill@@ ings for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is twi@@ sted : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still had the SPD boss , Socialist and Democr@@ at &apos;s Prime Minister always looked at a certain concern for Berlin .
only no stor@@ my coming from the party , just no counter@@ wind from the federal government - was the most important desire of the election strug@@ gles .
since Martin Schulz has changed the party , that fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , employees in the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House cont@@ ested the events in the SPD ruling in the country &apos;s capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with head@@ winds in this approach .
there were fail@@ ures .
and one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU faction proposes a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can easily go@@ vern , &quot; said CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editor of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising cargo handling of a green @-@ member state has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a heavy crisis .
five months before the country @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their single @-@ vote by the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens &apos; Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called the down @-@ down Lower Saxony @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return its mandate .
the crossing for the CDU means a clear dist@@ ortion of voters .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets will immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the federal leader and election manager of the Green Party Congress ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the heading of the green East German MPs to the CDU , without their own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state .
and no one knows what is next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the un@@ expect@@ edly optim@@ istic defeat at Saarland &apos;s election in March .
a blue eye , more not , beat the com@@ rades @-@ stone @-@ time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
that was also true - and it was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ a sh@@ ook the party smoothly .
with difficulty the com@@ rades in the weeks later they returned .
then the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came out of Hamburg .
and with him came the next deep step .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus for this weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because , in the crisis , after that , everything was wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
since , due to the VW @-@ gas aff@@ aires and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ised .
mic@@ row@@ ed re@@ fra@@ ctions came up .
anyway , or perhaps , because , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to put stronger in the bun@@ ch of acc@@ ents .
the amb@@ ition of the former Mayor of Hannover , decided to expand his power in Berlin , was not covered with com@@ rades in the Martin Schulz environment .
they let him grant him , because , because there was a stabil@@ ising of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because , because of the party internal necessity , because of the party &apos;s internal origin , because of the party &apos;s internal force , because of this .
and Schulz did not say .
at times , the com@@ rades , the com@@ rades , therefore re@@ comp@@ es to hold its own ranks .
her anger is foc@@ uss@@ ing on the green , and here especially on the sec@@ rec@@ y par@@ liam@@ ents in the life@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ at@@ orial , such as Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets its own career of career about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , leader of the party conference in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editor Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ AGE has not been elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to Parliament on the state list of the Lower Saxony Party in the country .
the logical consequence would be that they return from their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the voters &quot; of four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as a peak candidate for the Bundestag election to the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there were more or more out@@ ages of the CDU Niedersachsen .
funding for local core III
who wants to renov@@ ate his home in the years , can get soon from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g city development on Wednesday was sens@@ ed .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again seen a look at the events so far .
since 1991 , there is in sensitivity in sens@@ ing areas .
at that time , in the renovation zone I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation zone II from 2005 to 2016 , it was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development and not only close new building areas .
on April 4 , I received information from the gover@@ ment of the Karlsruhe Government that there will be a san@@ atorium area III .
the amount of funding amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the Church sensation .
how is a renovation work then ?
you will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
however , it also plays a role , whether in the planned area ever stood interest , to san@@ itation .
if necessary , the region limits could then shift again .
the pl@@ ank was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
in its framework , the contents of the &quot; Social City &quot; programme presented the content of the &quot; Social City &quot; program , which will then be carried out during the framework .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of interior cities , improving the living and working conditions and preser@@ vation and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per land , is carried out .
the renovation work would eventually be considered stat@@ ute .
the cost of funding for the funding period has been running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory inspection will take place once again , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation centres holding a questionnaire .
in November or December , the set of movement should be made , so that in the next year we can begin with the renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann announced that every municipality had to carry out the mentioned pre@@ ab tests .
it is necessary to evaluate the urban abuse , and decide when it is san@@ iti@@ zed and in which extent .
it will then be purchased for the respective property as well as a san@@ itation plot in the basic register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann is going to get a sensation again , and a picture of the location , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow Quest@@ ionn@@ aire is the &quot; building and land @-@ piece arch , &quot; in which it comes to the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential area .
the blue &quot; operating system &quot; is only re@@ plen@@ ished when in the building business premises .
however , to consider , Got@@ zel showed that a full @-@ filled questionn@@ aires were not at the same time a request for funding .
in addition , new structural measures are not eligible .

there can be no funding for later &quot; reservation . &quot;
at the conclusion , photos of the project &quot; local core II &quot; were shown to make a refurb@@ ishment a refurb@@ ishment .
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so he can open his front door , enter his office and even start with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ on , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and offers now the service for companies and individuals who want their lives using technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out in medical grade .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the firm of Mr. North@@ western also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing in the last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American Civil programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Senior Citi@@ zen of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter designed in Connecticut was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck .
the military office of the White House called for the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn ended , following the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that helicop@@ ters arrived on July 17th , at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and so long stayed until the La@@ wn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours , a second crew was needed for the return flight .
the original air crew during the event was during the helicopter , while security personnel remained in the plane during the time on the plane .
out of the TIM@@ E , the recordings were not clear whether finally , a second air@@ case was necessary .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal government to use nation@@ alized ownership of political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it sounds as if you are locked , &quot; said the Deputy Commander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was called the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President announced a violation of the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated efforts to con@@ strain the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is only beneficial for politically adv@@ an@@ ta@@ geous purposes .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
ump brought a study in February , when the presidential jet fired up before the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states to be made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
h@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often run training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn , to put the U.S. president in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
when tro@@ op was at the G20 summit in Germany at the end of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 exercise flights throughout the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event attracted a meeting of flight signs for the month , said an official .
helicop@@ ters were flown in an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers have no burden for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to exp@@ el the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have any bud@@ get@@ ing labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ zation of the US Secretary of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement is for the V@@ H @-@ 3D but 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
recordings of the unit recorded flight time of flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of helicopter is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers apply on the basis of estimates for placing things , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters .
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance , and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the conventi@@ ons for Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I &apos;m leaving hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on them .
and I think , as most Americans are we all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course reasonable to raise it . &quot;
it was not clear whether she inter@@ acts with the helicopter he inter@@ acts his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump said to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and talked to the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga occurs in the table third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC @-@ Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the standings third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games still f@@ law@@ less balance , the runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has received the sense for reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly did respect of the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that plays in quite similar formation .
right now on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , the imports come from the high north .
&quot; their Danish and Finn@@ s can even point out on the line of the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ ry ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it will always be hard for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white , Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier could give .
it is the moment the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man not for the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing for its first deployment in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ sky at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should also be as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ el@@ ap@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster also Má@@ té Val@@ u@@ z could put back into the team .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking List in January 2016 , not one of the coaching station by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can damage the O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not succeed when on Wednesday evening his signature was under the law of tigh@@ tening the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his past , the law en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming against the US stock .
after all , the draft considers to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines into the EU .
more recently , investors from domestic O@@ MV are co @-@ financed by the Russian eastern se@@ wage line Nord Stream 2 in cooperation with other European companies .
the dr@@ um@@ es is enormous .
however , it was too early for an estimate of consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would even have to raise sanctions even by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are ready for choice .
&quot; the press &quot; has watched which the group could refuse and which could really hurt him .

role back@@ wards : the town asks 46 kitchen staff
the city is organized by the K@@ ita @-@ Lun@@ table herself .
with solid contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the watch is turned back .
on September 1st , the City of Kre@@ feld will take over the dining hall in the urban children &apos;s day facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in their own capital .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Research Center , this is good news : &quot; we were all delighted . &quot;
everything is cooked to the house : a Cater@@ pillar will take over this task and supplies freshly cooked .
the town runs in the Kre@@ felder area 46 children &apos;s day venues , in 44 the children get a hot meal for lunch time .
during the year of Kit@@ a@@ year there are 2,@@ 800 children at the tables and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 participating forces have warm the meals on the 1st of September . they warm the delivered meals , supplement them around let@@ tu@@ ce , raw food and fruit , slic@@ ing the meal individually , give the food out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the workforce are firm firmly to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group @-@ group as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides about the scope of clock .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says French .
&quot; so they are much more integrated and it is easier for the kit@@ sch service easier , educational concepts . &quot;
because this is why it is : healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ force team is there useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not always changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by specialist cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that they put out in the price comparison between property management and foreign exchange for the city as the most economic , says it from the press office .
and this , although 46 participating forces will be re@@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , the UN says
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , reig@@ ning leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are de@@ can@@ did@@ actic in the provinces . three women tend to vote for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
elections can only be representative and believ@@ able if women are un@@ restricted and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban have published threats against a election process that coinci@@ de with the transition of international mar@@ tial arts to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time handed the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

without a lo@@ ot , the duo fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB Bes@@ org@@ nis on investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie would like to make a loan over the long @-@ term commitment to plant in its plant in Glasgow .
the company said G@@ MB Scotland that the company was silent via the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work , producing their own products hob@@ by@@ bs and rich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the Bank manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s decided to express his concern for the financing of production lines will not be presented . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , affects our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers are strongly concentrated on the local community and the big space of Glasgow , an important pillar for human @-@ related employment in an area of high unemployment and social influence .
therefore , at the perspective of employment , wages and prosperity , and in front of the background of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing life management and the chronic output of production , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokesperson for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Bank manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we estimate the ongoing commitment at employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate as all enterprises that are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business will continuously check - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .
we recognise the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and completely . should our operational processes change at the location , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes their interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar in pursu@@ it of N@@ ey@@ mar after killing an offer of £ 189 million to un@@ fold its free spins , but have warned them in Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .
after the ending N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ s@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out without constra@@ int , although a source near the Catal@@ ans pron@@ unci@@ ation insi@@ sted that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned about the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents in front of this view ?
when Manchester City won an interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi was a strict warning for anyone who wanted to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish Society express their interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G clearly shows that it would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having one of their prizes for N@@ ey@@ mar .

it would very serve as the appearance of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own affili@@ ates or their in@@ correct evaluation of the processes .

regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it would be prevented for &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio @-@ ethics committee .
the An@@ acc@@ ness , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion that is intended for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go to the church and that &apos;s a new font . &quot;
she also pointed out that , in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they f@@ use it un@@ fair to turn their standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the des@@ irable accidents , also Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was written with R@@ atz@@ inger the &apos; My brother of Pope &quot; written in 12 languages ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all of that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ re@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high density mobility , 67 domain spar@@ rows .
in the final report , it is called &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can hold firmly that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality has just been able to strike punishment for the students .
unlike many other regulations , contrary to numerous other regulations , many victims of the general humanity are estimated to be in@@ valuable and therefore in many cases , even positive memories are associated with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann says , why the final report about the Miss@@ ing andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ Sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger believes in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non @-@ violence against protection authority in the Dom@@ en@@ burger Dom@@ o@@ atzen &quot; is a contradic@@ tory image by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
as a result , many students stand out his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot;
in other words , it appears as a chol@@ eri@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became aware of the oil if a domain was not a top performance .
how do you analyze this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : if you perform the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , one has to ask oneself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
he has just dedicated eight pages , and he is well acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or compassion in the terrible day of sexual abuse .
the violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of his private sphere .
you can do , if too late , experience it too late or not have taken the first ant@@ agon@@ isms to be taken seriously .
the school of the gramm@@ ar school , which he worked , was characterized by virtually all those surveyed - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus also the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is a very good testimony to describe it as &quot; warm heart@@ y , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able teachers who provided the boys regularly with cakes , cookies and bond@@ ons and &quot; always cared for from children &apos;s grapes . &quot;
merely a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotions , which led to W@@ ut@@ u@@ er@@ brü@@ ten too .
that he did not only threw himself with chairs and threw the key b@@ lows on the floor , but also ear@@ ne@@ ak and too joy@@ ful guys on the hair , or having ears , he has already been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
for his honour , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frag@@ ile time , 1960s and 1970s , to parents like teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 .
I also have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared to what it is actually in this report , namely the ab@@ ject sexual abuse and violence at pre@@ school , they are free back@@ at@@ balls .
one thing is asking if there is not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI , that many media had just stor@@ my on him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e many people who never understood him are still jeal@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report lists Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , related to the report was reported very much about the topic of Miss@@ y at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ re@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report by any involvement or divi@@ den@@ ds in relation to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : very clearly no .
there is no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault that tru@@ sts in the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even parents were dedicated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed myself to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; said one aff@@ ect@@ fully representative of the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
the real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not trust in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ Sp@@ atzen @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in view of the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : a question@@ er student form@@ ulated this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he was counting ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had tim@@ ely experienced and could have the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I keep it ... even for really absurd , accept that it will be reck@@ oned to him ... bu@@ b int@@ ru@@ sive and clear@@ er , or rather , as compared to their parents , boarding conduc@@ tors , trust teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that he did not trust him in the advance of affected pupils and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to acqu@@ it from every fellow worker .
so he cannot be accused of having failed , or brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradic@@ tory crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases .
in the media , much of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; was to be read at the Dom@@ en@@ burger Dom@@ Sp@@ ark .
the former cathedral @-@ chapel Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of having taken part in the &quot; Weg@@ ener &quot; report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : that &apos;s the great problem that everything was mixed and confused to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle , in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is also clean separately : between the pre@@ school and secondary school of the Dom@@ en@@ atzen between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once , other pre@@ ferences .
furthermore , the report inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us leader of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ row .
all the terrible exam@@ ining ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were properly schi@@ z@@ oned and mal@@ nourished , all have taken place at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ andal@@ ous conditions prevailed .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ o school .
on that was , like most witnesses , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
it was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ dig@@ an &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ Sp@@ atz@@ o High School ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : there is no discipline , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims have received the general humanity of R. &apos; and therefore in many cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
so at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the states on pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger closed the ears in front of conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ Sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
in this point , it points out that in the preliminary school , he continues to practice the test penalty . &quot;
in view of the risk of negative pres@@ ump@@ tions , he recommended an urgent action .
this was of course , at a time when legal clarity , as a trial pen@@ alties , which had long been banned in Bavaria .
before , they took place in a legal grey zone , as everyone else knows .
it was hard to estimate that , where the affected may be ex@@ agger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where really the ad@@ missible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say , he always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the examination of schools has officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : we speak some histori@@ ans about the &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; which is at risk of evaluate the danger of today &apos;s moral standards .
the Princip@@ ality has right there .
but this certainly does not apply to sexual abuse , which was in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence in innocent children &apos;s household , which is already far beyond the time .
that &apos;s all quite aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be stopped .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all of that had nothing to do with him .
its means relating to discipl@@ ines and punishment , so ear@@ chers and to move to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
what image of his rainy days is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger did in our conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject of investig@@ ator also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ Sp@@ ark played only a minor part .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t wei@@ rd at all , that he did a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there .
but this must also be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which demand un@@ condition@@ ally , it would probably hardly have been possible to form a institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , the true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical traditions , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not make any big singer and overcome before each success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcome .
what a man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ eman : through the work on the book and beyond that I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and always experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep believing and heart@@ felt people of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something .
I &apos;m getting regularly , just like many former bar@@ riers still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency , regularly keep contact with him to read it - he is almost blind - and it is like a member of her family .
those who have not given him today until today , that he was strictly speaking to them , so clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ est@@ spar@@ rows are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought the world of music .
and that he always had a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful one , to which they still look up today and hon@@ oring them .
and please , once again clearly : all that is going to him are educational methods which were then on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is very un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and a prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin@@ k@@ ish .
there is the evil intention behind it , just too obvious .
because the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now it would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has purchased great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns and perhaps Germany would probably meet the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ Sp@@ aces , at last finally in peace .
