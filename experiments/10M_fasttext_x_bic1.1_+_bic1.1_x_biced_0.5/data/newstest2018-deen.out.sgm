<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four cards that change your sight to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where youngsters are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A grave chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers are farms the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card coin promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when landing cards are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows all that had to be exciting, because the car-Navi took place a green meadow instead of a circumfence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital state of Bavaria, an offer of the Geoporta Bayern regional government, are all other than current - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online-cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is then clearly, as towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a Flickentephah that one can not recognize as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">There were more maps for towns and municipalities in detailed maps, so-called Urumpetals.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, and during the first time measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wish an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although the French troops finally pulled the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, they were the today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The national team for Munich comes from 1856, and is, like all, can be found on the website of the Bavarian Authority.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the provincial capital is the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was arrested 21 years after the completion of the map, so 1877, in the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, subsendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses subswarms are concentrated in 1856 along the castle of Plinganserstraße, which was only named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers uprising against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the west park is, there is nothing more than fields - at first glance: when zooming appears a smaller component with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "urine," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers there today - but small farmers in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is drawn north of subsendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, which had been the scene of the October Revolution, was actually a meadow in the 19th century, and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map shows a glimpse of the history of psychiatric medicines.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the urine sheet, man reads only the street name "at the Gasteig de district of the present district of au-Haidhausen, or at the top height" In the air side, "but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstreet one was once there people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">There were in 1858 / 59 the Munich-Munich-Irrendition "On the Auer Lüders."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of a psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchor of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the staff to turn violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, it was first place to be extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the county gate in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East has been one of Germany's largest psychiatrist.</seg>
<seg id="40">Juveniles on the grounds of former Auer Anstalt now meet young people in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and operated him in a youth centre.</seg>
<seg id="42">Located west is the football field of TSV Munich east, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - built in an architectural approach to the origin of the Irrenaissance which had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was "listed" in 1856, "the Kaufingerstraße was named" Kaufinger alley. "</seg>
<seg id="45">A crucial change was also in the heart of the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allied bombs broke out many holes in the inner city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses, and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof during that day and on April 5, 2017, the Spatenstich will take place for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the Schieberter you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights publishes itinerary for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union to promote senselenium has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of State in Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri, which should come into force on August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missouriians, as a series of questionable, racial-based action occur in the entire state and shown here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent lawed law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution authority of the state, aimed at disproportionate on minorities, said the group, the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have breaches of the civil rights, the people to pass.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are painted because of their skin colour, they are crushed or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events such as racist negotiating against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances early of the year, after having no more fuel during the journey through the state and had taken care of the police in custody, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out on a recently published report by the Office of the General Prosecutor's Office, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will keep 75 percent more common than White.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and know their families, friends and employees, what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring it to the Caucasus, or to know his relatives that they travel through the State."</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri reported 100 of hate crimes, following the latest numbers from the FBI's report program, which puts the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The trip is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain a company because of residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a travel regulations for Texas and Arizona since the United States agreed to commit local prosecution authority to conceal people because of immigration laws, which will contribute to the subsequent inclusion of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">They are generally issued by the Ministry of State for other countries, but last time, advocacy groups have deployed the measure of response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman's fishery Weighaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU committee in Peter White and Kordula Kovac are placed in front of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fisdemann family in the town of Schwendemann met with Thomas Schneider and the two deputies with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann opened first insights into his farm where he is cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" is for him the alternative marketability for the milk of his cows, so swivel.</seg>
<seg id="73">A regional desk will come exclusively on the table of the Feria.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also a BLHV-chair by Fisbach, he distinguished the course of the "elemental project."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green land care for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have been here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the eldest operation and managed to manage this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it is not a biocidal farm.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy with the leader-funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">At a cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the request of the areas could still be moved out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people working in agriculture, and thoughts on how they continue to carry on their operation," the mayor faces.</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in critique of criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area therefore amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be checked until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders were promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers fall 12 610, who they had to invest in 16,2 km of course.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained panning.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and compatriots."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also Peter White stood up: "the best food products are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The regional counties (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows the state funding of pure fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">Premise is the existence of one of the lpr-drawn conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, it must not be poor-protected area (Hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened with the opinion.</seg>
<seg id="95">This is currently the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which almost 16 kilometres of fence are planned for the fishing stake in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now, the White House of Trump is taking refuge in the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest character of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as every other - so the caring of Saddam Hussein's caring took place on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Pump regime, certainly knew what he did when he received a symbolic axe in an hotly dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN over the proposals by the President to drastic immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and liberty of Liberty would have landed him, if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed their meaning, and especially the importance that you have been attributed to the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, which was added to its basis.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller receives Acosta: "I don't want to go to a whole thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was added later, and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factual correct, but how he formulated it, does not really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on the flowering words of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your trash, your poor, and your oppressed masses who strain themselves free to breathe freely, and the rest of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elty apostasy" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - it clearly shows that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural argument: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after her death on the basis - knew very well that they completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans, indicating the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this importance: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a quite different name: mother of the Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on US Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change this far back by the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty came in, but rather an early newcomics that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not to shine the way in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The big phantasy deed of Lazarus was in it to see how it was seen from the exhaustive, but hopeful people after lengthy and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope, and of the will that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not be enlightened, but hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two shottos belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in world champion "will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London in 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland has developed something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we are trying to understand it, and we will continue to find it," said Black.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the circumstances of the circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butalia - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit while Eiliie Doyle was elected leader of the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her chapter "speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh brought completely natural, were magnificent. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner that will compete with its fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdle, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shooting stars in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which had been reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle route of Muir leads on this road and has installed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part on the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another carrot, one after a great season, which included the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The managerial captains says that "enormously" in the fact is that many of their compatriots are not only to the team, but in some cases also the medals and the finalists will be involved.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be the team captain, is in it that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammate voted for me and chose me, making it something special for me," added them.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb for poets.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech in capitals concerned?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it's just like a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public ministry when you cannot bear the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't last long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from the Domestic Policy until its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He was safe in critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">Because in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we will lead the sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's staff have blocked contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union denounced him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as a frivole, and the online comment was full of a return reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a solid hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a pristent means to make himself with his voters and debuted to his hair-free brain on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons that come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to as officially, and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse on the actions of the governor and argued that the blockage of comments continued nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolls or spamming or hasseroling people who ploughing the pleiting online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail corresponded with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer in Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not fulfilled, but she asked to hate hate.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people on the same subject is taking place, then they will be miscounted as a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">As the members of the governors as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call other "intercession".</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to attribute a message by blocking one critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductors, to burn, and to silence protesters and to silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happens just digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticise him that he implied Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is proclaim by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County counselling the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a record from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received an ACLU visit for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington's time, the time of an affordable portrait had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers registered between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous walkers smashed on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitioning, which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, the Trade and Shipping with Britain, have been overcome, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put it to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, opinion of opinion, and courses are on the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club</seg>
<seg id="207">The ex-Europeans no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days at home comfort because the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.</seg>
<seg id="208">The Nordire, who led in the Archerfield links to the end of the year, before being joined by Paul Eales, joined the new venue and operated as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.</seg>
<seg id="209">"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he reaches its fame with this event," Rafferty said.</seg>
<seg id="210">"the players will see this course from its best side, it's in a great state.</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry made a great job when he set this place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is an eager-supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time, although he won both in his 32-year career at the European Tour as well.</seg>
<seg id="215">"that feels really special," said the players in Southport.</seg>
<seg id="216">"I have not able to defend the Extremadura Open, since they had won them in the year, when I was taken out of the program.</seg>
<seg id="217">Back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">The memories of the last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon, to win last year.</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a truly special time and one that we will always appreciate. "</seg>
<seg id="221">Gary ORR, who came back to the European Senior Tour once a year earlier this year, returns to the home floor.</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more if you play at home," said ORR, the man from Helensburgh.</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you sensed this additional pressure.</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy as it has gone so far. "</seg>
<seg id="227">With the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.</seg>
<seg id="228">ORR and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.</seg>

<seg id="739">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of Obama administration in which the States agreed to classify the smog-causing emissions, after 15 states accused the agency for the stride.</seg>
<seg id="740">The EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to move the so-called "ozone provisions 2015" and said, "it is showing the commitment of the agency to cooperate with States.</seg>
<seg id="741">"we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our state partner," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="742">Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPA, to determine the ozone regulations - in which in a portion of the country of pollutant emissions should be measured to determine where the cuts must be taken to delay more stricter airquality standards - to delay a year by October 2018.</seg>

<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and a adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square metres of space for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Common Assembly convenes such a common room not to be seen as a meeting point only for the residents of the seniorical living area, but open into the church.</seg>
<seg id="755">As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the round.</seg>
<seg id="756">This decision will be reconciled by the delivery of funds for the current budget in the last autumn, by delivery possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="757">The construction is in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">The furnishings of a common room would be, thus, Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent can be eligible.</seg>
<seg id="759">The decision proposal to signal the investor is that in this regard, there is no pples between the legs, which is close to him that both semiters - what reduces the level of setting - what the trash level reduces and the construction of economic power - could be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless, not only Wilfried sole, be this additive.</seg>

<seg id="762">Not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">Daniela's reputation refers to the many of its own buildings with which one is not going forward with such a word, and you can now rest in the common room from the window, says: "I do so hard."</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger certainly speaks for the common room - but completely against a municipal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind a concealed subsidy at rewards or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">That's not so, because with the acquisition of the surface you give no access, but get a real, in case of doubt, the counter-speech is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigers, motion for resolution accordingly, finds three proponents.</seg>
<seg id="768">So it remains with two objects on the original program, which Stefan Haller summarises: "if we handle the decision, we make a huge step, to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="884">The latest results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden to undergo a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that over 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old. but not everyone believes the accuracy of this results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish National Authority for Forensic Medicine has started the conduct of tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They are to be more exact during the asylum application of the age, after the Swedish migration authority (Migrational et) for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees has been criticized at the age of age.</seg>
<seg id="887">Migrations has been sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty per cent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency informed that the person "might be 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are only carried out in cases where the person is asked in question.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are durable during the past months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no difference in statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person has been judged for more than 18 years, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have weighed over his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases to propose that the undersearched person is 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found the 581 results published, it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it would be 18 years old.</seg>

<seg id="897">A sceptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska-Institute, whose work comprises the assessment of biological maturity of humans, to see if they walked earlier or later than usually through puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">To assess the biological age in this way, is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">If we can't tell it, we should not do it as if we could see it, "he said to the newspaper Metro.</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="902">The greatest risk is that if the person is under 18, this case is about 10 percent. "</seg>

<seg id="1094">On the consumer protection portal www.growarnung.de, the German states have the most recent information on the affected eggs in batches.</seg>

<seg id="1096">Even if according to everything we know currently, a health hazards is practically impossible.</seg>

<seg id="1098">The food monitoring is part of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Nevertheless, my house has been shut down immediately and has been informed of Germany's parties in close exchange with the authorities of the countries.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How to move the Finance rules of the football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to target enormous issues of European football matches won't interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Spain to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">There are some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA yet, because the leading organization controlled the European game has the power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">The financial fair play rules, which was launched in 2011 by the UEFA Cup, mean that PSG must point out at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million US) to buy the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make the money loose with safety, so that Neymar is underwriting and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the Qatar-rich rulers of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend much money for the acquisition of players, but with legitimate springs, they must allow them to break the break-even point in their way to the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platinum after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success, effectively fraudulent and risked to ruin when banks or owners moved their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP relied from the concentration of the club's debts to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model was used by Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then powerfully invested in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">For the current three-year-old FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses in the amount of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini dropped by the presidency in the Congnad in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferment continues to take advantage of excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a package deal, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the deposits can be expelled for the next five years amounting to 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 is the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the worst sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (back then $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million Euros, and it was ordered that the teams will be limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014-15 season.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outward their financial statements by linked up their income by companies that are linked to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataric corporation may sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA must not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA concluded that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA of the Qatar Tourism Authority had been puffed up.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by the organisational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar was informed that Neymar WM will be ambassadors to find out that Neymar WM will be simply evacuated for UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA is more attentive, to consider any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA has no preparation with PSG about Neymars Transfer, told the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of the Anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not fuelled to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of €542.4 million a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year will have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrive a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, merchandising and tricot.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The Association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signing of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football player, and they tried to prevent Neymars Wegener by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear fall of" financially Doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Katars and the official owner of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that financed an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country has an association, everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="1157">It's very difficult to respect the financial play, because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country. "</seg>
<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new Schoggiants</seg>
<seg id="1159">Chocolate Frey Board-Chocolate for Swiss Made in the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the welcome cooperation is in front of a possible end: the airline rejects the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlp confirmed on request of the news agency SDA a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northern western Switzerland" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, Airline will shut up a new agreement in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be reviewed every two to three years and undergone a quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"with the current supplier Chocolate Frey we are very satisfied," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Some 17 million small rotor packed shades of 14 grams per year spread the flight attendant to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Over the costs the Swiss wanted to do no data.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insider appreciates the order volume according to "North West Swiss" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs, with an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a goggiate manufacturer it is an prestigious contract.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Like many applicants on the new call, Swiss does not like to betray Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Only Swiss manufacturers are in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article, Chocolate Frey wants to make an effort of the agreement over the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the biggest Swiss chocolate-manufacturer was not accessible to an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Chocolates boards distribute the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before Swiss got a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut has delivered in cooperation with Hug the chocolate tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The opportunity to place the logo was Swiss prior to two and a half years ago with Chocolate Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>

<seg id="1182">Also with the first attempt, the Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who designed 65,13 meters, were qualified for the end of battle.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Nostalgia continues in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" to the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of the story is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-year-grunge "The State" for MTV rotten), and for itself - that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise, it feels like that time.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was not surprising, not only because of its absurd Humors (it contained a original story for a speaking canned vegetables which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By getting on the core of the gags - actor middle ages play horny children who will grow up - nevertheless, they make the possibility to win the last part of the weather.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adult who now play adults, is less emotional rooted and his parody goes more after the shooting down principle, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90-er years such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that crack the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At a point to browse a character through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showage), now Romanticor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy malicious Plot with which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Shownold) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian's).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always the courses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dimmensatche of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old buhacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">There are the moments of chance to heat this franchise like a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even at "Glow" with its East-West wrestling quarry.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy by Brian Granewood and Alessandro Tanaka's comedy with Rhys Thomas as director, a Romanian drama of the eighties with both policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who are fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main cast - a hard healer Gregor and a idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt will be synchronized in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than one idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to view (the police spends the time to watch out chess on TV, as Americans may do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous spokespersons - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Finger' voice.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda of propaganda - a murderer, who carries a Reagan mask, is involved in the fact that it is often like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes it passes away, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which was reproduced on a smaller length, could even better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef will always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who wasted a bunch of hampers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined Communist public is that western culture can make everything for food for a age.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictive Romanian Creator were not wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with their own.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Impact on drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched during the Black Forest-Baar Circle, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 moths were arrested in the age of 25 and 77 years and already arrest warrants issued against them already issued.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officers provided larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand Euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">These two are therefore expected to be delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The action took part in the Italian and Bavarian investigators.</seg>
<seg id="1219">More than 300 policemen were used in total.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The members of the Mafia was accused of drug criminality, heavy violence, attempted murder, and robbery and robbery.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office was established against organised drug dealers in the South German region.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the offices in Constance and Palermo there was an exchange exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contacts with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, the large insert on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">In the vision of studies, Italian nationals combined with respect to the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Also a incident on 27th May in Hilfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant in the early morning, is likely to go on the bank account.</seg>
<seg id="1226">A wise acclaim large gaps in the foreigner register</seg>
<seg id="1227">"data from citizens who should not appear": according to a report, the foreigner register has significant shortcomings in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1228">This lead to partly serious lack of misjudgement on asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The representative for refugee management of the German government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, sent a media report according to large gaps in the country key register.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Shortcomings for the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and deportation orders "in part of serious lack of failure," warned in an analysis that is the "Süddeutsche Zeitung."</seg>
<seg id="1231">According to the register, ten million people have been identified with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data are therefore administered by about 600 emigrants in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data were not adequate, the data quality in parts have not been well-maintained so far.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are long no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizen and should not appear anymore in the register."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"incorrect data input can slow down recurring processes, so the report continues.</seg>
<seg id="1236">In statistics on foreign citizens, EU citizens should be captured, which would not have to travel.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Such false sentiments, however, led to a distorted debate on how to deal with reconciliation, therefore it is therefore in analysis.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Meanwhile, the federal government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they travelled from there.</seg>
<seg id="1239">This is based on an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, "the New Osnabback Newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="1240">In the paper it is called the BAMF lead the proceedings relating to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - according to Italy since 1 June 2017. "</seg>
<seg id="1241">Since the end of 2014, it was practically no longer possible, the newspaper applauded with reference to the difficult situation.</seg>
<seg id="1242">After the Dublin agreement it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach them first.</seg>
<seg id="1243">If a migrant travels to another EU country, this state can send him back to the departure.</seg>
<seg id="1244">The post office is now available: "in the meantime, the admission capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased."</seg>
<seg id="1245">Italy have given guarantees for reception and accommodation by families.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) hold on these additives for sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1247">Other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1248">The internal political spokeswoman of the Bundestag in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke criticised this decision: "families with children, due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights absenting conditions and a threat of child life."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Second best result achieved</seg>
<seg id="1250">In a total of 220 litres of blood in Oberreichenbach, a total of 220 litres were already available for other people.</seg>
<seg id="1251">At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1252">Above all, Jürgen Greule, who, in the meantime, distributed 100 litres of blood in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Traditionally, the congregation commends multiple willingness to donate multiple willingness to donate blood.</seg>
<seg id="1254">"it is brilliantly, as our body is created and we will sacrifice the donors for donations that their blood is available for foreigners," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.</seg>
<seg id="1255">"a single blood donor helps several people," explained the Kreisbreeder of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because conservatives are crushed in their components.</seg>
<seg id="1256">For example, three people might benefit from a blood donating.</seg>
<seg id="1257">At the same time, Maisenbacher reported from the promotions being carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.</seg>
<seg id="1258">"in this year we achieved 114 donations, the second best result," said the DRC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">Obviously the change to the theatre house had led to higher participants just a few years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England will likely be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and weakening the speculations have dampened over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth "will remain" as they kept interest rates on family income in the midst of a strengthened pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The policy makers of the European Commission (MPC) of the Bank voted by 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25%, with less members rising in this month, as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for increasing demand.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In their quarterly inflation report the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and in 2018, the pressure on the budget would continue to continue, although inflation in the fall is expected to rise to just under 3%.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But she signals that in the coming years, interest rate would be necessary to curb the inflation of the Brexit, and it said that the loan might need to rise more than expected to the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw a part of the mammoth economic stimulus, which was published before a year after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">It will demand time to finance the financial plan to provide budget financing for banks, even though it is expected that they will be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in part of this system - at 115 billion pounds sterling.</seg>

<seg id="1274">The Bank's projected growth prognosis of this and next year are projected to 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound dropped to these messages, compared to the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound dropped by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the latest disappointing growth rates have slowed on average expectations and increase the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">Growth is expected to grow at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover easily after the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1282">The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pounds, which will compensate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The decision comes one year after lowering of interest rates to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the pace.</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy completely.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Prior to the Bank's last judgment, the call to interest rates was increased after inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households, with three political decision makers in July require a rise to 0.5%.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said, the aims at the ratio to its target of 2% was "quite" to the weak pounds.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Andrew Montcabal, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "in view of the recent decline of swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive, as the lending force was heavily looking for shops and that year in positive way.</seg>
<seg id="1289">The market is especially good for those who exclude the existing Deals and include the new mortgages, and many with free-free options and low rates are becoming popular. "</seg>

<seg id="1292">NHS England gave evidence that a pre-risk reduction group (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection at high risk provisioning by about 86 percent, now is delivered by health service over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Live life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resisted in 2014 by a major house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I love myself in love and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1.000 square foot of the apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a telegraph layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Staudhood and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous covers.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the Architectural Design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi in Notting Hill, to create a 12.5-foot high ceilings to create a home, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to each other, so that the architectonic challenge was to create a mezzanine, where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative in order to solve the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so far that they were stacked on each other, without having to gaps ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not only about building a simple platform, but put the steel so that it had the right height above or below the right altitude. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled it to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper window of retrouvius looks down on the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Spreaded gold-furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirroring plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored, to make it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, pipated units offer space for all the sitting areas and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of living room can exclude the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineer went in," says Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>

<seg id="1355">We are struggling for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a meditation for one of the biggest real estate imperial Victoria in worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Former director of the Carlton Football Club 'and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and property should be broken.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul was trying to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp meditation on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties in worth more than half a billion dollars, then since the family moved to Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco family founded Jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the Stadtzenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. bull as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin has been described by Paul as "principal driver and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial review states that this means that Colin has owned money worth $316 million and worth $176 million in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The allocation of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as a propane.</seg>

<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this was not true, but Paul introduces himself to manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit that was handed in Colin, he says he was hoping to join the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides of the law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi, Italian immigrants and delicaciers, operated in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick during the early 1970s.</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff Trumps plans to limit the media coverage of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it actually.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, it will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first working day with conducting employees, he established a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: poor information that fall into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should take over him - whether on paper or in mailings - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnostics makes sense, but others tried to tame the bull by monitor his media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when the candidate is delayed because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was to convince a fair reporting of places," said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February against POLITICO.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key, trumps Twitter habit is under control, according to six former election campaign officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steamed praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit ever "was" under control, "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these struggle, we know what we don't know, that Trumps Tweets wouldn't contain any more ignition on their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it a few times, troubles him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent junk controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a white house, which are competing for competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by present Trump material, which may potentially promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants, due to the president of strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example written by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press parts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he can find out how these originate from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February, when someone violently accused the president of a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banned because of chikanas permanently from Twitter, or that he has no more specific evidence, or that he expressed in the past false accusations and resisted them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmann added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager, as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counselors are still under influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">This unchangeable factors do the Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1429">The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the Millionth series.</seg>
<seg id="1430">They brought horses, babies and an army of transportation, after they were dropped out in May, but had been deported by one from the junta in order to prevent their accidents.</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed her vehicles through a section, which remained unobstructed to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Residents have pressed the Council of Solihull, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1433">An anonymous dweller said: "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers.</seg>
<seg id="1434">The Council must be forced through shame on the implementation, since he was useless when dealing with the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1442">To support our mobility collection, it is very important that as many people are suffering a anti-social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101.</seg>

<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being reopened and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambience company Gesellschaft mbH back to 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year lost, and also revenues by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, the numbers of refugees that came in the district were offered as a collection room for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the creation of a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel site.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenko's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer in Bad Bergzabern bought the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the Three-Stars-Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenchib.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Jury Prize</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair, US President Donald Trump is alleged to have used a so-called Grand Jury by Special Representative Robert Mueller after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel has recorded the work in the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" referring to the point of trusted people.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper accounts the step as characters that Mueller has expanded and intensify its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there is already the first pre-loading of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence service accuse the Kremlin to have targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller is examined whether they were referenced between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the investigations of the investigations, several men are expected to aggravate the election campaign as a consultant of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps of private and corporate environment among the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Representative of Trump would personally come into the centre and seek the accusation, whether the President may hinder the judices in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to prove and decide the evidence in possible interruptions and decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are also called anchoving chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Generally it is turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecution in order to obtain persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the station CNN, already pre-loading tests were issued to turn around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Beside Trump Jr. also Trumps counselors and swimmers Jared Kushner and his friendly election manager Paul Manafort were talking to the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right experts said on Thursday night in US television that the suspension show that Mueller does not interact in his work and that he should be necessary quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it had to be promised that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of a charge.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the enforcement of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday night took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic give the Democrats a possibility to feel "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement, he did not know any of the suspension of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This, however, usually work in the hearing, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House endorsed any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent on "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The earlier FBI boss James Comey told three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to accept that something has changed, and it was stated in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">It was only used after Trump Comey was fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rationality, accusations against Trump became loud, he wants to hinder the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June, before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to investigate his investigation against the then national security adviser to Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to US media, the White House collected material on special agent and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller is dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the congress, such as in the Watergate affair, the President Richard Nixon, Mueller is a position in which he could be fired on crush the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step but prevention.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators were arrested on Thursday, after which the special agent could not be released so easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic ice mountain takes off in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Arctic the gigantic ice berg has replaced by almost seven times the size of Berlins by the Schelhüts.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This is the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometer large flowed now to the north and probably will need two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres long and width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest kingdoms, who registered the researchers in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">In the extent of climate change a role played at the demolition of the Ice Age, it is unclear to the research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been an unusual merctures of unusual soaps in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The fractional colleague had so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelhüts so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Shrubs swimming in the sea and is fed by great glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks up regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelhüts is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeat was the equilibrium of waxes and abort in a couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete sham was crushed there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I speak a lot for it that the Larsen-C-Schelyos is in danger because the front edge has never been so far withdrawn as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under tension and can be crushed, if a piece of key cancels.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg increases the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice as much water as it yields to the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the mold means that the glaciers are directly into the sea, and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could increase the level of sea level, however, only in a low degree, writes the British research project to observing Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelholidays is the fourth biggest of the Antarctica for AWI-related information, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">On the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and conscious of us no direct link to climate change, the iron sign now comes into an endangered position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most broadest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Under scholars may be controversial, whether the Larsen-C-Schelholidays will now grow again and possibly reverse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this trend will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg do not lead to climate change, so in the past few decades, many ice cubes have been crushed in the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirts of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the past 50 years, counting the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1562">The aim is to cover not only short-term requirements of professionals, but future orientated by the applicant's shortage, says it.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate oneself within the inside and outside, include concrete action for cross-entry and an apprenticeship initiative, call CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>

<seg id="1615">This also recognized the first federal ligaverages that are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The VfL Wolfsburg, followed in the beginning of July 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen, one could even be present on these markets online as only once a year the federal government will send to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">Why is it exactly?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-Sport games, computer games like "League of Legends," "Counterstrike" or "Counterstrike" or even the FIFA simulation of FIFA on a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">They have long ago, as in normal sports, Lies established, in which the professionals are competing against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in Asia, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is safe in need.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobina has also dealt long with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports- University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport, for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Besides, it need cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only exercise at the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But also problems: "doping is always more and more" doping. "</seg>

<seg id="1640">Players are international on the way, that's like a big global family, there is no intercultural events.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by management consultants Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) tells the e-sport a fast growth ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros has been implemented in Germany, mainly advertising, sponsoring and great tourneys.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to grow at 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league, this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the E-sport "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice-hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.</seg>
<seg id="1646">International, many countries are already continuing.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Great markets are Asia and the USA where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez will participate in the US team NRG eSports.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend by lyrics and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed on parole.</seg>
<seg id="1664">In June, Carter was convicted of negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, which took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is unlimited.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but their legal representatives argue that both it and Mr Roy has been working on a psychological illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured bluse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, folded hands and down, when they were condemned.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions were killed by Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor in court.</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">She has no responsibility taken over, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="1673">"it has no remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters attorney said it was a "terrible circumstance that she has completely regrets."</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a right precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit suicide in order to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case moved in national attention after carters reveal text messages that she had encouraged him to finish his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hanging on, spring from a building, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages sent to his death in the two weeks before his death was on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the eyes of his suicide she wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything that you have to do is open to the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press of the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The legal opinion has divided the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1690">That Joshua Kimmich was allowed as captain at the Audi Cup, is no coincidence.</seg>

<seg id="1700">Kimmich confirmed: "that is what man wants to do as a player:" take responsibility. "</seg>
<seg id="1701">On Wednesday the 22-year-old took over the field as Mini-Lame.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Right back, this is now its position, the white binding on the arm did its rest.</seg>
<seg id="1703">And, at all, Kimmi worked in this starting formation, such as the one who can take the Ruder at best.</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed troupe.</seg>

<seg id="1716">There he heard of Süver an interesting proposition: "what happens here I have already noticed.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effective, because the plant in the past years was exposed to climate change, which has brought much rain in spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the life span of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zicade, a microbacterium that wears the dwarf, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there's a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only attracted to holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of doing very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">Solutions that are considered into account include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground, but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties, which are more resistant to dry.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The Assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa, organised crime, corrupt civil servants and inational drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was informed to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades, or to leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: opponent, Neutrale, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask reporters, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal perceptions.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug admissions, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while all the country breaks out, there are more journalists. at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto, as President Enrique Pena Nieto, have been in office in December 2012. 589 have been under attack and threats under federal protection and now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will feel deep, though its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows its middle finger on the front of the Rioce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts who are smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although it was established in 2010 by an Austrian Foreign Office in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only led to the Committee to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, each year involving drug dealers and organisational crimes, the murderers of journalists are only rarely tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce, they still persist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting, even though the terrain is still traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time to waste in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why, we suspect to all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was shot by two men. he was shot and shot at him for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove out in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to travel around in Culiacan free.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing to silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition of the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It makes nothing that anyone can be shot at Sinaloa every day or several people on the road, or that the graveyard is full of toned, two-story mausoleen for drug-rowers who are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbors and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Initially, in February the publication of a interviews with Damasco Lopez, a leader of a rival cartel fractions held in the war with Guzmans.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have offended the sons, spilled gearboxes delivered every copy of the output when she was delivered to newspaper cosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was that Valdez was not forced to force her, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country at its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined the Riodoce's five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars involved.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without entering the rdote problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the sales and the advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard treading investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by one publication that they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors" Cabot Prize for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In that same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican Drug History, wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily, that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live further," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug dealers in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either this or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of many dead... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Rioce team missing Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse the friend who was generous with hugs and counselings, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always be to El Guayama, the bar opposite the office and sit there on the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to ask her own assumptions on how they can do their job done and stay alive.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-efficiency and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own Installed.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, in Sinaloa, no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones were allowed. days before, spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in joke, some of the writers asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who described the governor itself as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug admissions are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has picked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the eldest brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exile to the public spending that focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led to Culiacan in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who has been kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favourite locally from drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">One reporter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politicians who ruled the ruling institutional Revolution party (pri) which ruled nearly all the century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of corruption of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about former incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman passed a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, readers would have watched the column of Valdez as the best informed source on the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before that we knew what has happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender corporation.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sticker, dedicated to the killings of journalists, because the staff have become something they never expected - activists in the press name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist at the Office of the State Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame vanished three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become stronger, as they have written in organised protests "SOS Press" on walking and building sites.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the Valdez-case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to propelled journalists and bring it into the truth because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked since that she has been divided by the government, because she's concerned that their anger has violated their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organic crimes, involved in government officials and an equally valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug trafficking, but also on orders from politicians and security forces that awoke up with the organized crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">The media group "Articulo 19" has more than half of the attacks allocated to journalists of the police and officials last year.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die, because they want you to keep the mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterring effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgotten the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found together with a note that allegedly was signed by Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones, in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua, following the assassination of the correspondents of MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do like El manana of Nuevo Laredo, following the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez introduces himself publicly to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their homeland, or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as it was revealed by the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, gives the drug dealers to frighten him.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I was reporters," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already completed, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all started to summing up their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting paintings with bandages and security forces near the Mazatlan had 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the onstone canon, they have published the news on the site of Riodoce on cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens are nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers, who held the watch to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">If they were afraid, they did not show it.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Among the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all the Sinaloa, followed by Riodoce's vestiges.</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to soften his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">It looks like a statue, like a statue.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinocorns of a Canadian miners were so well preserved that experts have described it as a "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even realize that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said they would have had something of a "unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-held armoured dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered sort of nodosaurs, living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition has researchers to describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eaters is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn radio when he died on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something that was missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blind a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisa of Dinosauriere."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this vegetable fresser, although it is covered with armor, and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by flesh crevorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from robbery, and used a paratroopers, which is also known as counterfeit detection, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix well into its environment and to soften his enemies, experts tell us that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled it by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the casket, a widespread defence method in animal richly, which means that the top of the creation was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the denominations are common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals today living.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by insolvency dinosaurs, that evolution Blocked the confrontation with the confrontation of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the consolation shadows - think of deer, zebras or arbals - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurs was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armocked dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs nivores must have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists still examine the animal on the evidence of his life, including his fourth generation, to figure out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs died when he died, caught up into a river and cast into the sea where it sank on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florias today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservated skin, but it remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal" says Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal is almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only catch a little bit with the eyes, you could almost believe he's going to sleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, that stood on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaurs was hunted by some of its furtive ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This is one of the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tonnes heavier monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the ocean and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn radio when he died on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle until the hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures had an average of about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch spikes, which raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant eaters has been shaken by western Canada until a flooded river was flooded in the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater exploration of the dinosaurs ruled his armor in exquisite item detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remnant remains of this special specimen are so good that the skin remains still hollow tank plates along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I anser it, the more confusing it.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot is on his side, its five fingers crossed over.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the sheds on his sole '.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass horseage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous convicts, mile long stakes - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">At the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), there are approximately 20 men injured in the late Thursday afternoon of Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first information of the police, at 17.00 o'clock there were between the connection positions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm just under 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, domestic vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1976">No details on the exact number of injured persons were first given at first.</seg>
<seg id="1977">They were mild to moderate serious injuries, said police officers.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of life-vehicles was on the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The journey in Munich formed a approximately ten-kilometre return ride.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Like a AZ reporter, it was also on the counter-way to massive disabilities - by numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade notched the attributes of the vehicle workers, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive impetus.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 o'clock the second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">And there was a collision between a car park and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter has been on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is sitting on the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is plunged into his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: exhaust.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor and wakes a frog or rips the rides in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Tickets control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of the breaks are over soon.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently testided the major ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">Just confirm by mobile phone that you should be taken at his place and evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"comes the offer, wide we are from.</seg>
<seg id="1997">It will likely be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote-travel routes in Germany, "said a train speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort check-in" is the railway card recycling without Schaffner.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to use it, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket - what already the most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased via the railway station, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of the ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The "comfort check-in" works like this: one gets into the train, calls his ticket under "My Ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test clients, then a button for the electronic recovery will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendant receive a message on their mobile devices that Fahrgast X is in turn and taken the booked seat.</seg>
<seg id="2006">The train attendant at No. Y knows he knows there is a passenger with already off-value online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which is to use the passenger in turn.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to get your ticket to your train ticket through our train companion, check out the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Management of DB correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Who runs on train, knows that in addition to delay and pasmodifying trains, the ticket inspect include the biggest trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case, one of the fellow travelers don't have all documents that you need to devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either missing the credit card or identity card or any document you need to quote.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train attendant and Fahrenheit, which leads to a bad mood in the waste part or wholesale and delays in control of their own tickets and the conductor at the end of time taking care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented and scrolled by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police has just killed an 18 year old child and it is still on the road," said it.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Perplexed, since nobody had posted the information on her feed, she graduated Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was saved continuously on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the St. Louis area was there, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed, tweeter.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Browns's lefosem body, which was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," I thought out Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone to tweets later on the evening to tweets on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of police tape and people, cried, and a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a bellyhound dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said that another policeman secured his rifle and cried: "I'll all kill you..."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered her testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"it is not the type of murder, which we have used to us and that we can call it typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">In this moment I felt shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she repeated her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie, "Whose Streets?" in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival, love and loss, strength and loss of resistance, which consists of the perspective of people who live in community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell ran with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two have a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"do you remember how black people have to fight for this, what do they believe in?" they remembered what she said.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson because the police had killed 18-year-old boys and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">I couldn't take her away, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know, and it must be drawn up and logged.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I am lucky to give you an experience in which they personally experience any eklatent racism, it is not unlike the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel that I would assign a bad service to keep them far away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located on the South Florissant Road, a village opposite the police station, which was at a camp site, as the activists on the possible non-accusation by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new type of activism for Ferrell shape.</seg>

<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the Organizer.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by people of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had co-operated with the former Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around the death of death.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought about Ferrell's project closer together with six other locals followed the team from "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we're talking," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are presented, because so I shall be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">The aim was to concentrate on Ferrals's experience - to demonstrate that it is a Messiah-leader, but for a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents are showing documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells, as she loves and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work and in the publishing of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is making the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who had marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identified as a weaker form in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we fight permanently on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women have to wear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to notice that "the movement really is held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an inasmatian type of action," when the Ferrell was chosen because of its identity as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook those energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, even though it was on the forefront, because with a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the message cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell has been on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a Chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she klummed to a song and she feels obliged to this memory, ever since she went three years ago in Ferguson on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another and assist.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size": TV-readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the South-east of the pedestrian zone has been sparked the population in supporters and opponents in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the topic is cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery says: "it would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That's really class" (Nicole sighs), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply simply: "size!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which the rest of the shops benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Additionally, the gallery will be located directly on the grounds, on which the farmers market hall is located, in which 13 directors offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - at the Beda square with a possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been selling almost weekly in the farmer's market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the compatriots are always happy to come back.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing are located in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the amount of renting.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This should probably not be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the most shopping mall in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, footwear, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our town.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shops stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is the more important that we at least keep the markthalle.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For all, the goods offered are fresh, mostly sold directly from the producer and is obtaining to obendlessly.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping mall only of larger firms, because the local rents are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It's a pity, special transactions there are almost no more and that of which is still left, will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle covered me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market stand during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery appears at some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already manage to distribute all the shops out of Bitburg before? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">To my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market, it's too many - as I find - sensual building projects in Bitburg no more space anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmer's market hall was made, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which hang almost unstrange - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-Tues and hair sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison where the former secret service analytician confounded a 35-year prison sentence after they publicly incited diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was agreed to expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and groundbreaking discount, whose condemnation by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his position.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Manning and made out of the 30 portraits, such as someone can appear with these genomic data, a sharp if also some intellectual property could not only be interpreted, as they can be interpreted and inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly spoken about the identification of the woman since their puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 prosecutors, including six violations of the spy act, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her picture was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white strange, sitting in the maning seat uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wearing a platinblonde silver- which was associated with her.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just returned from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions. "</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stummel and chewing gum by extracts the DNA from waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time that she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg, a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not take photographs, so she caught up contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse were sent to unequal Briefferonds, which took several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo's comic book "Supplied Images," that would translate a future in which the President Chelach would translate and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was released, Mannings would release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump leads to war against informant from government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetables, which he should actually fix, further to flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things happen out of a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, the artistic testimony called Manning with her superior signature (the "i" in her family name) an end to the "automatic collapse, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence -a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoping to show the involvement of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how surprising, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>

<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, therefore 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in your own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic language.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it emerges with a free spins in the United States, as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they are cold out of your speech, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," said the artist who greet you from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I always get geese if I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally so as it was foreseen in the comic book - but when she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks which are like Horses of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, until the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic hapetus were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement, which also raised after their liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Doctors of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nationwide human race is going on for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, which had been sought for suspects, after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been stabbed to death.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shows the acts of the Cook County Court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, passed away after several bullets.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A special warning system published by the Chicago authority in Chicago, stating that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the site of the event for dead, and detective examination as murder while the police is active after the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president of the University of relations, said in an email statement that Lathem had been bewitched now and excluded from the court of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates at this study," said Cubbage.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesman for the university and the Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to assist the US investigative authorities in any possible way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and wanting to prove himself.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago authority in Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he needed to suspect the suspects on the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police has an idea of her whereabort, and our efforts to localise them," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national agencies can help finding the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said, the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Plaza-building, who had just received a permanent tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as a very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim of a relationship," said Guglielmi.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents: "the police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim, and explores a variety of motifs, including a possible case."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will close the WADA vehicle plan in the near future" - the Russian vice-mier Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">The Russian vice-mier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the world anti-doping agency (WADA) implemented for restoration of Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of fulfilling the schedule of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">The WADA vehicle plan was updated in this respect, "explained Mutko on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-enforcement of RUSADA and recently published on the organisation's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he contains nothing what could have been concerned for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future, "added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria cited in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities authorised the findings of the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state sponsored dopings in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "we lead the investigation, as our anti-doping system has put an error.</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">But there were no government programs, and we will not admit what does not exist. "</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos words agree with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov announced problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Nobody has to accept this report unconditionally, "added Smirnov.</seg>
<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was expelled as part of Doping skandals by the WADA by dioping control in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">It was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA general manager Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA "moved to" in the right direction "to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the headquarters, submit formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said it was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems, which were sitting in offices in cities or states, were hidden, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - have been identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can move closer to this holistic, 360 degree view into the experience with employment," says Vitrano, who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in the employment of employment."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Company started to take ethics, values and employees in 2002 to take advantage of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen for ethical reasons through the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media" came to their right "that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their dirty clothes online.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convert offer your software as service, and tanning the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors, which both support start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convert received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured a $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than so far.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio businesses are doing well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools promise you to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employees's commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless when the company's caretaker take no measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, there is an anticipation that change on the path is.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this disappointments and staff can motivate them.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, the company that has seen themselves to have relied on the collection of data.</seg>

<seg id="2254">And after the collection of feedback from frustrated employees it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">On Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights via employees, and it hopes for a long run, that leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is well-known for high sales.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts up at 23 AM, when a lot of UCLA Footballers are on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have moved their tricot parts and show the back full of silence on the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these two minutes make a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are registered to the summer courses will return after the three-hour exercise in their final tests before they return at 6: 30 on the Waterman Football Center next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"that's the next three days a real Tretmill," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three courses of the UCLA at 19: 15 are beginning to meet the players already completed.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time, during Moras six times in Westwood were conducting practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are expected to hold 18 exercises in August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their opening against Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2273">The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the Camp is finished, resulting in view of the clear sight of its fields of an adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been run with footballs, which will be no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"it's a real problem, and it is not far-fetched to think that people can rent a room there and then set up there to draw an exercise.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-er years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history at the Mainl River Valley in Kent, and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England stretches out time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It's not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the calendar pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a double agger in the 1700-year-old who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his Dauraction!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect as it would be as well.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Ah, I love Archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is defeated so with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have given my welcome offer a little over") it seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days that the Victorian "new" castle to explore the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the Mongolian creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with agriculture partners, gardening partners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only given the full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said" Oh, throw it onto the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps that represent what possessed: "one could mean that landconflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that fought two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go down! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collections use the castle as a starting point to enter a broader basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer', who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant rising from 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording from an uproar who appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled" Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ', "says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant stood in this field and I thought was an uprising was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps they are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit Pattern that hidden the family Darrell seven years during the English reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', presented in the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, filled his own funeral, filled a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his Sarg was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney, saying: "the masters seemed to be quite a bauner, always make money back and spend money for things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-males delights their debt crisis by giving up the elderly women - I present them as a heap well worth looking guys, with a knack to advertise landlocked. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his engagement in the castle, Rhodes fell in search of other unique writers.</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänki behind herself, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been returned by nature again.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But Scotney took a special place for him.</seg>
<seg id="2321">"I was sad to go again," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2322">It was like: "Oh, now I have to get ready again with the damned life."</seg>
<seg id="2323">Campaign launched: over 300 years old Marionelle is covered in Rhöndorf</seg>
<seg id="2324">With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marium chapel in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched her campaign for the introduction of a new roof-brand (Rundschau of Thursday).</seg>
<seg id="2325">Until Thursday, Mayor Otto NEUHOFF and his marketing team aims to keep the logo and the slogan secret.</seg>
<seg id="2326">At the end of August, there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island Grafenwerth.</seg>
<seg id="2327">"too beautiful for us.</seg>
<seg id="2328">Or?, we wonder the makers of the action yesterday on posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"we think that (of course!) not really," write it on their yesterday website.</seg>
<seg id="2330">"but we use this measure to win your attention.</seg>
<seg id="2331">And to make clear that much better is than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In essence, we are the solid conviction that we know as a bad Honnefer to know the beauty and attractiveness of our town very well. "</seg>
<seg id="2333">The action puts it by more than "only" a logo and a slogan, so it means.</seg>
<seg id="2334">"it is true to formulate a single-standing promise that gives the city a distinctive likable entity."</seg>
<seg id="2335">Eventually they stand up in the competition with other municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="2336">The city Bad Honnef can be adjusted for a mid-term amount and cost the campaign.</seg>

<seg id="2339">So this week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the attempt attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting did not place more in general staff, as previously, but in the Prime Minister's office.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the presidency of the government the five Vice Premiers, as well as the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>

<seg id="2348">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties on the movement of exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan as a wire suspension of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Around 486 people who have been involved immediately on the coup attempt will have been involved in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan expected the revolution attempt to overthrow as "religious gift" because he gave him the opportunity to cleanse the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really handle the army in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="2352">In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "Uncautiously in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">The general staff give it concerns about an increasing "Islamic Emirate" of the army which manifests itself among other things in the raising of the headband for solo institutions, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the bulk solids in the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan was fired by decree another 7395 policeman, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed, as Erdogan was tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times her calling on her role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan urged the power of the military step back to step, not least in appeal to the reform proposal of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is implementing a Islamist armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the "Vocal Europe," a prominent officer, who sought refuge for the coup attempt in fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists in a few years."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, NATO could not let such an impact on Nato.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought there will be no more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robot is currently a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny about it, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," says Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern ropes have developed from their inflatable partners to robots using a silicone skin, which feels warm-up - with consciously human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adapt to its robot even correspondingly to its beliefs "and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still worried, as many robots have the "personalities" that would release a Stepford-woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sutuppen have developed to robots using a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt to its users to adjust their robot to the properties that they are appealing, for example relapsing.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relterness, and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," sweeping the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">This is what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods throughout the day - just as real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, to be fixed in conversation, or she can be "in mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects with this rise of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the submissive female properties called rape when you take a step on Frigid (called here: resisting) Farrah is concerned, intranquil one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her emergence and increasing refinement show something dark and deeper in our culture, at a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes, to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, are not having sex robots, and while FRR notices their rising popularity, they still remain at the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what was leakened out of the edge zones, in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange, or offensive, until they have given the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain persuasive that this highly developed sex-robot in a time emerge in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there has been a president in the White House who practiced women are sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid's') are not the graphic pictures, the closed body and an outstretched eye, but how realistic this vision appears.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a large jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex-robot is to make a physical resemblance on actual women as realistic as technically possible (although also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their peas want it to be human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, at the point, when it comes to their "personalities" the robot constitute no real wives.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that could interfere with independence or anything which could interfere with imagination.</seg>
<seg id="2422">To be expressed differently: you are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: mathmaids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of wholesome human lives</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binding period of the dump of the Trump era that the political circuits that have the U.S. voters being kept polarized, also families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest festival there was in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump eating.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to meet us, in order to burst out our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticing is the power of Trumps, families united.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I will mention this because my cousin, a left-wing gasket that lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity of a common enemy can have a mighty effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With ump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to get the dining table, this certainly is a good thing, but it falls in a further context that there is also significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was reinforced by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to move forward to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">If we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the grassal chance that we will no longer pass away his cookies of one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a troubled long-term scenario, in which the Repump Republicans of the Right wing "normalizes," which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as the epitome of reason.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgic for Mitt Romney's urtious version of decay - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax returns) - which occurs in comparison to Trump in fact as a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans must be mentally sound to qualify as an inmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to Karussel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of the New York car department, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crammed and the animals are turning to watch full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the delicious music. this gives a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage, the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not part - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussel is still a strange experience since two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I had given the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked him.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on my street it's the same thing, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but exercise pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>

<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence from Pistorius Appell, by which they say that she was too late.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National prosecution authority said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young Gockles, the cylinder wore to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stand for integration, said school teacher Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young man may be different than the other young (chicks), but belong to it.</seg>

<seg id="2485">The same day they were released, while currently a study expires.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The State Department reported BTV that Bulgarians was released later.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have covered control over the free campsites and place to anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose, which is not responsible for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2490">Software update for diesel vehicles: what those affected must now know</seg>
<seg id="2491">How exactly does the software update take place?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers need to participate in the campaign?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in an overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">With the diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars in total.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They are expected to improve emission classes of Euro 5 and some of the Euro 6 emission classes.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:</seg>
<seg id="2498">Is the new action mandatory?</seg>
<seg id="2499">No, the negotiated software updates are optional.</seg>
<seg id="2500">"the mandatory updates before apply only for the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Federal Office of the Federal Office (KBA) has ordered their rearmament.</seg>
<seg id="2502">How and when will customers be informed about updates?</seg>
<seg id="2503">The manufacturers announced a fast implementation in the next few months, but not an exact date.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Daimler has informed us to write every person concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If an inspection will be due, that will be done in their frames.</seg>
<seg id="2506">How long can the equipment come up?</seg>
<seg id="2507">"hard to say," Smetanin says.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The hangings of the manufacturer's commitment, as well as of political pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"for we have seen that the dealership did not deal with the environment on the subject of environment."</seg>
<seg id="2510">How long should the update last?</seg>
<seg id="2511">The conversion itself might take only three to four hours in the workshop.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Time-consuming can be a date to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do that do not drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE advises to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably foreign manufacturers would follow, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Is there a massive price fall of Euro-4-cars?</seg>
<seg id="2517">The ACE will fear that.</seg>
<seg id="2518">But just in the regions where driving people are threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2519">In rural area there are no value loss for older diesel.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The ACE advises to wait for sale.</seg>

<seg id="2522">The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2523">The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become politically.</seg>
<seg id="2524">One of the winners will not come - from protest.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Ll Cool J (49) gets the first rapper one of the coveted awards at the renowned Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95).</seg>
<seg id="2527">Handed over are the awards early December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join with his wife Melania on the awarding.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The winners of the progressive TV series are announced by the winners of Lear to abandon participation in the gala.</seg>
<seg id="2530">He said "The New York Times" said: "this presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and that burdened me."</seg>
<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to declare her visibility.</seg>
<seg id="2532">According to the former President John F. Kennedy, Kennedy-Zentrum is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumaster, goes into retirement in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The site is already written - suitable applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker City Building has been in charge for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still does great fun, as he communicates in the press interview.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports from varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it amazes him that no application has been fulfilled for the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is seeking an architect or Civil Engineer at the next possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus, under the contempt of regular cancellation-periods - still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was employed to serve the board of administration as a subordinator authority, the applicant must point to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city definitely.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could not fill up this anymore, citizens would have to leave for consultation until Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But Bürgernägerm was the city and himself important, says Wacker who reported from a good operating climate, as well as good mood between authority and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office, some major projects have accumulated, on the cheers looking back with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth seeing," it is safe in the building department and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects are standing on the agenda: the reshaping of former Hukla Areas and the Lower Hall Square are around.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The pupil bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium is still a theme.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone is the latter with some 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," appreciates hackers.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here makes fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">Be compulsory for a city council in large games room.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslachs own building yard and gardener's own site can be reacted in many respects.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"people can move much," so wackers, and the design of the green plants is often commendable by citizens and visitors.</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town as ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to "to have an eye for it," if newbuilds are approved, "the defending city builder.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The Stadtbaumaster carries high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">He is a building, "at the end it runs all over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">He is able to count on many long-term employees: Markus Neumayer (Hochbau) has been around for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been around for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "we are looking for someone who really identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">For continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If he wants to bury Roland Wacker, it should be admitted to the city of Haslach as a graduate studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with technical direction of architecture and have good expertise in the sectors of building and construction.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The municipal office subordinates high and civil engineering, construction planning, undergrowth issues, management of urban property, urban farming of building yard and gardening equipment, as well as sub-construction administration, including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Cast a bike on pipes: crossing the south route</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of the Leobener Straße (B116).</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged, that the heretoed freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for their night hours after them.</seg>

<seg id="2573">To be out of a "substantial" sum, the spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="2574">The damage were fixed on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the railway line could be led without disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Almost ten persons were out of Friday afternoon, two of them concerned the correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains dropped out, but they didn't delay delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch had to be exchanged some 200 metres of sittings.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (Flammable intestines)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based protein and dairy products could be the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States, affecting approximately 1.3 million in the United States, causes stomach cramps and blindness, recurring or bloody failures, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the sufferings, meat and dairy products have come to avoid their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of protein found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of protein found that promote immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conducting researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in the food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of resolved inflammation, promote inflammation, promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the equilibrium is too far in direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments were observed that a kind of tolerance conveying immuncell in mice came from having a certain bacterium in its initiate.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium is needed tryptophan - one of the blocks of protein - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan rich nutrition tolerate, less inflatable colorecy exercises when the same system can work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate of Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was seeking a kind of immune cell that encourages tolerance as they found out that a group of study powers such cells had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, but had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumes that the difference between the intestinal microbioming of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were mounted in a sterile environment that they lacked a gut microbiom and had not developed this type of immune cells, and they were created the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria looked on the immune system, the researchers sent L. reuteri in a liquid, then resulted in small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-borne cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleaned out, it turned out as a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism that is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerability conveying cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri are protecting from our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan adore products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The evolution of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can result in an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2606">The Chelsea's 40 million pound signed from Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Cup-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed people as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the blues and took only 45 minutes what Mourinho had to improve that he had to improve the Premier League season before the beginning of the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"we will help him to be ready sooner than later."</seg>
<seg id="2610">In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho his start-XI for the start of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent Leaked in this week that Mourinho had wished for three more preferments, but he insisted that the club has already performed a "fantastic job," three of his four priority newborns to fulfil.</seg>

<seg id="2615">The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of an Dreamliners in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state of Michigan and went to the form of an Dreamliners over the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.</seg>

<seg id="2622">New billings for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind is twisted: as Sigmar Gabriel still had the SPD boss, Socialist and Democrat's Prime Minister always looked at a certain concern for Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Only no stormy coming from the party, just no counterwind from the federal government - was the most important desire of the election struggles.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz has changed the party, that fundamentally changed.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, employees in the Willy-Brandt-House contested the events in the SPD ruling in the country's capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has been given from there since the beginning of the year, would not be described with headwinds in this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were failures.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="2630">According to the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU faction proposes a general signal against coalition of SPD and Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once more: red-green can easily govern," said CDU-General Peter Tauber to the editor of Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">The surprising cargo handling of a green-member state has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) in a heavy crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the country-election, his red-green coalition lost their single-vote by the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Greens' Green Party leader Michael Kellner has called the down-down Lower Saxony-member Elke Tjackets to return its mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD-Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the heading of the green East German MPs to the CDU, without their own government.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what is next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Misere started with the unexpectedly optimistic defeat at Saarland's election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, beat the comrades-stone-time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">That was also true - and it was clearly worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into exchange, the Düsseldorf-Plea shook the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">With difficulty the comrades in the weeks later they returned.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then the G-20 summit of Hamburg came out of Hamburg.</seg>

<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Landeschef, lost his Nimbus for this weekend, because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town burned.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because, in the crisis, after that, everything was wrong, what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then Scholz fights for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Since, due to the VW-gas affaires and his role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony's Prime Minister has already been criticised.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Microwed refractions came up.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Anyway, or perhaps, because, because in the past few weeks, Weil tried to put stronger in the bunch of accents.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The ambition of the former Mayor of Hannover, decided to expand his power in Berlin, was not covered with comrades in the Martin Schulz environment.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him, because, because there was a stabilising of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Because, because of the party internal necessity, because of the party's internal origin, because of the party's internal force, because of this.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz did not say.</seg>
<seg id="2661">At times, the comrades, the comrades, therefore recompes to hold its own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Her anger is focussing on the green, and here especially on the secrecy parliaments in the lifejackets.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Who wants to renovate his home in the years, can get soon from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development on Wednesday was sensed.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler had once again seen a look at the events so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there is in sensitivity in sensing areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the renovation zone I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the renovation zone II from 2005 to 2016, it was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote the interior development and not only close new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received information from the goverment of the Karlsruhe Government that there will be a sanatorium area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount of funding amount to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the Church sensation.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a renovation work then?</seg>
<seg id="2682">You will continue to investigate so Schindler, where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">However, it also plays a role, whether in the planned area ever stood interest, to sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the region limits could then shift again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The plank was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">In its framework, the contents of the "Social City" programme presented the content of the "Social City" program, which will then be carried out during the framework.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalization of interior cities, improving the living and working conditions and preservation and expansion of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is, per land, is carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation work would eventually be considered statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The cost of funding for the funding period has been running since January 1, 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the inventory inspection will take place once again, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation centres holding a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the set of movement should be made, so that in the next year we can begin with the renovations.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann announced that every municipality had to carry out the mentioned preab tests.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is necessary to evaluate the urban abuse, and decide when it is sanitized and in which extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">It will then be purchased for the respective property as well as a sanitation plot in the basic register.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann is going to get a sensation again, and a picture of the location, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel stressed, an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow Questionnaire is the "building and land-piece arch," in which it comes to the structural condition and the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing," data can be made to size, distribution and residents of a residential area.</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "operating system" is only replenished when in the building business premises.</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, to consider, Gotzel showed that a full-filled questionnaires were not at the same time a request for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new structural measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler still emphasized that the distribution of conveyors according to "" wind "principle." whoever comes first, grind first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">There can be no funding for later "reservation."</seg>

<seg id="2714">The cost of the White House cost taxpayers thousands</seg>
<seg id="2715">The White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing in the last month will cost taxpayers according to the military, which were left to the TIME magazine, up to 24.000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American Civil programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senior Citizen of the White House made a tour of all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter designed in Connecticut was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House called for the presence of helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South Lawn ended, following the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2721">The message showed that helicopters arrived on July 17th, at 7 o'clock in the morning, on the South Lawn for the event at 15: 00 and so long stayed until the Lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">Note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the restriction of the service hours, a second crew was needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original air crew during the event was during the helicopter, while security personnel remained in the plane during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Out of the TIME, the recordings were not clear whether finally, a second aircase was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal government to use nationalized ownership of political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2728">"it sounds as if you are locked," said the Deputy Commander.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was called the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President announced a violation of the reform of health reform, which was in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to constrain the government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One, is only beneficial for politically advantageous purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">Ump brought a study in February, when the presidential jet fired up before the background of his first Kampagnenrallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is thrilled by the show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states to be made by American workers with American materials," said the deputy head of the White House, Lindsay Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn, to put the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When troop was at the G20 summit in Germany at the end of July, HMX-1 led 58 exercise flights throughout the White House.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The flight for the "Made in America" event attracted a meeting of flight signs for the month, said an official.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopters were flown in an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support commissions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers have no burden for any of the other props which were presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman by Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved to expel the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have any budgeting labels for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the Stundentarization of the US Secretary of Defense for fiscal year 2017, the DoD replacement is for the VH-3D but 24.380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Recordings of the unit recorded flight time of flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of helicopter is far below that rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers apply on the basis of estimates for placing things, is most misleading," said Walters.</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the conventions for DoD does not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract.</seg>
<seg id="2750">At that time, the former secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helicopter for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present these week things, which are produced in America," said Spicer.</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security, and I'm leaving hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on them.</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think, as most Americans are we all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">It is of course reasonable to raise it. "</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the White House, Trump said to representatives of Sikorsky and talked to the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "domain sparrow report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domcharrow Report on the Missile Brother from Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This writes author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report of the abebrow scandal at the Domenburger DomSpaces will continue discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisner, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," stated after the publication of the German press agency, he is expecting Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as Mayor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, a apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would very serve as the appearance of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own affiliates or their incorrect evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">By contrast, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that with the reporting on violence among the "two" measure. "</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the grips in Regensburg, no one doubted that it would be prevented for "shameful and shameful deeds," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bio-ethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The Anaccness, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion that is intended for normal, "writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go to the church and that's a new font."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that, in her youth, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They fuse it unfair to turn their standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the desirable accidents, also Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was written with Ratzinger the 'My brother of Pope "written in 12 languages (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all of that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domreatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high density mobility, 67 domain sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is called "Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, it can hold firmly that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">High Emotionality has just been able to strike punishment for the students.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Unlike many other regulations, contrary to numerous other regulations, many victims of the general humanity are estimated to be invaluable and therefore in many cases, even positive memories are associated with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann says, why the final report about the Missing andal at the Regensburger DomSpatzen Georg Ratzinger believes in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440 pages report on the "incidents of non-violence against protection authority in the Domenburger Domoatzen" is a contradictory image by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">As a result, many students stand out his "Humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">In other words, it appears as a cholerician and perfectionist, which became aware of the oil if a domain was not a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Heseman: if you perform the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, one has to ask oneself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just dedicated eight pages, and he is well acquitted of every suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible day of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence at the preschool took place outside of his private sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can do, if too late, experience it too late or not have taken the first antagonisms to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The school of the grammar school, which he worked, was characterized by virtually all those surveyed - "salvation," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger is a very good testimony to describe it as "warm hearty," "competent," and "understandable teachers who provided the boys regularly with cakes, cookies and bondons and" always cared for from children's grapes. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Merely a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high emotions, which led to Wutuerbrüten too.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only threw himself with chairs and threw the key blows on the floor, but also earneak and too joyful guys on the hair, or having ears, he has already been deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">For his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fragile time, 1960s and 1970s, to parents like teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually in this report, namely the abject sexual abuse and violence at preschool, they are free backatballs.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One thing is asking if there is not more to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedikt XVI, that many media had just stormy on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope many people who never understood him are still jealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report lists Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, related to the report was reported very much about the topic of Missy at the Regensburger Domreatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger put in the final report by any involvement or dividends in relation to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Heseman: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">There is no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault that trusts in the cathedral-kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared myself to talk to my father or my mother," said one affectfully representative of the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not trust in parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the DomSpatzen-student Ratzinger's role in view of the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Heseman: a questioner student formulated this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see no case in which he was counting (Georg Ratzinger) had timely experienced and could have the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I keep it... even for really absurd, accept that it will be reckoned to him... bub intrusive and clearer, or rather, as compared to their parents, boarding conductors, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">Thus the report comes to the very clear result: "that he did not trust him in the advance of affected pupils and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed as part of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to acquit from every fellow worker.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having failed, or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name to these contradictory crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, much of "nonviolence" was to be read at the Domenburger DomSpark.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former cathedral-chapel Georg Ratzinger was accused of having taken part in the "Wegener" report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Heseman: that's the great problem that everything was mixed and confused to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean separately: between the preschool and secondary school of the Domenatzen between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say once, other preferences.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Furthermore, the report incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus leader of the cathedral-sparrow.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible examining pedagogy, the cases where the boys of sadistic teachers were properly schizoned and malnourished, all have taken place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous conditions prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger did nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspatzo school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was, like most witnesses, the theme of "Preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradigan" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the DomSpatzo High School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Heseman: there is no discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims have received the general humanity of R. 'and therefore in many cases, despite violence even positive memories."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported from the states on preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger closed the ears in front of conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Heseman: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the DomSpatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this point, it points out that in the preliminary school, he continues to practice the test penalty. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the risk of negative presumptions, he recommended an urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course, at a time when legal clarity, as a trial penalties, which had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they took place in a legal grey zone, as everyone else knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate that, where the affected may be exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the admissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say, he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examination of schools has officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Heseman: we speak some historians about the "Fallout of Anachronism," which is at risk of evaluate the danger of today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Principality has right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this certainly does not apply to sexual abuse, which was inconspicuous at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence in innocent children's household, which is already far beyond the time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all quite awful and I'm glad that it will finally be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all of that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means relating to disciplines and punishment, so earchers and to move to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then prohibited, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his rainy days is Georg Ratzinger did in our conversations with you for the book "My brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of investigator also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Heseman: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the DomSpark played only a minor part.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't weird at all, that he did a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said: without these perfectionism, without which demand unconditionally, it would probably hardly have been possible to form a institution of Weltrang, the true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical traditions, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone, you do not make any big singer and overcome before each success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What a man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger on the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Heseman: through the work on the book and beyond that I met Georg Ratzinger very well and always experienced a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep believing and heartfelt people of whom you can't imagine that he could only do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm getting regularly, just like many former barriers still today, 23 years after his Emergency, regularly keep contact with him to read it - he is almost blind - and it is like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not given him today until today, that he was strictly speaking to them, so clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domestsparrows are thankful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful one, to which they still look up today and honoring them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that is going to him are educational methods which were then on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is very unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and a prominent brother to make a medial sinkish.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now it would be a 93-year-old man who has purchased great merits and without the outside of Bayerns and perhaps Germany would probably meet the Regensburger DomSpaces, at last finally in peace.</seg>
