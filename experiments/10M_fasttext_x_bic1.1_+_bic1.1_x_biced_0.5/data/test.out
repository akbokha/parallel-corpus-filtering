Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the pil@@ es of stones
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf court in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er was looking for some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden cand@@ pil@@ es &apos; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after some minutes , the horses were remin@@ ded of their holidays , they gal@@ lo@@ ed at home in the rapid gal@@ lop of fe@@ eder .
a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and so the riding career didn &apos;t end again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was the best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he led himself with his family over the facility of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he was not s@@ worn in for photographs .
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen , too .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in part of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards in the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Federal Police Department , silver leaf bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen res@@ cu@@ ed him already .
long is the 18th Prize winner of the pyramid of pyrami@@ ds .
he arrived in Aachen on Saturday the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lang@@ er promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the double US mast winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
among the recorded shows the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ asium Eber@@ hard Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ous of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports fans came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , this illustr@@ ate society went into the jumping stadium where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize was running .
Bernhard Lang@@ er held a distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump would like to avoid .
the two US presidential fighters are however un@@ one in the tax and energy policy , as well as in principle .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton lies a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against such as the state of economy can damage - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton invites the economy to death and regulate , he says .
in contrast , he himself would be different , that Tr@@ ump said .
he will drive regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for individuals and for companies .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to open , he has the advant@@ aged chances of open and needs money .
that is why tax would be increased to the rich , says she .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the needs , Tr@@ ump and Clinton says almost no matter .
the Democratic candidate holds the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and will be rejected by the nation@@ alist Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ Wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
on tr@@ ump , there could be even part@@ isan discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are significant .
ump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the US .
oil production should also be possible in a protected areas , which he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement .
Clinton thus wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program , and calls for : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ lan@@ tic trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , both Americans want to is@@ olate the United States by international trade but just want to protect American jobs .
they are supposed to be paid better then , called Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars was a hunger @-@ wage .
she wants to increase it to $ 15 a hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question isn &apos;t quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be up , then he says he would not be changed .
however , the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to def@@ lec@@ t the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him , so that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least of the weal@@ thy wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every in@@ vol@@ atile woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are alone , almost daily .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house provides sanctuary .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby , which is only one year old .
one has laid her small son in his arm .
he looks curious with great eyes in the room .
his mother starts with a table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
see B@@ ahr by Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is a division director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social help in Bavaria , and deals with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are escaped .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodation for all@@ an@@ ese women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs started up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has been officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are politically pursued because they thre@@ aten them torture or death , or because their families are sending them as a hope of hope in Europe . &quot;
for women , other reasons for the run : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ mor@@ ant , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the escape , this continues .
&quot; for example , the tu@@ g for a bottle of water require a sexual act is no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that once they have anchor in Germany , consider , says B@@ ahr .
even here , women in refugee quot@@ ations are often regarded as min@@ u@@ rous and ab@@ used in worst case .
this causes some 90 percent of women who live in the property in the Munich city , trau@@ mati@@ zed , estimates them .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so familiar , that they should say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the living , because the shame is too great . &quot;
since they often do not have to help , more accommodation requires only for them , for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they w@@ asted from a similar project as in Munich in its responsibilities , some answers some with no .
there are not something similar to governments in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , women are not separated from separated women , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press pre@@ diction of the government .
in some common accommodations , both houses and houses in Upper Bavaria , in some common areas , there are only women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bayern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated , it can come to - ongoing violence against women . &quot;
especially the shower room should be separately accessible and accessible to women , is in the study .
how much the women feel of this protection need , you can read the visitor to the house in Munich .
&quot; since we talked about it has been around us , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants Rou@@ gh@@ ing : demands for new labour measures
Deputy of assist@@ ants have asked their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disp@@ utes on a new agreement .
the junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested his entire council to appro@@ ve more labour measures at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers could not say goodbye to the contract concerned about the Treaty .
assistance and medical doctors have voted on the cancellation of a contract in July which have been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the election .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday night , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said the government &quot; be@@ har@@ r@@ ently calm , &quot; which led to the fact that the contract was rejected .
she said , &quot; In view of him the J@@ DC Board voted to fully reject the proposed new agreement and calls for the official re@@ negotiations to all emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board appointed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing program of escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning in September .
the disp@@ utes resulted in the assistance of assistance of this year six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
according to the election of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , the Leader of the agreed contract conditions , recommended by the BM@@ A , came back .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that took place in front of the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical doctors , with that the contract should be adv@@ an@@ ta@@ geous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister for Health , Jerem@@ y Hunt said that the contract for Doc@@ tors in England would be cancelled .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of outside &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin made his Turkish opposite player in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot honour the impression that Ankara wants to write this reconciliation .
there was the blow , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was narrow@@ ly , and he was hardly an warmth , even for his rest@@ rained relations .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin , according to a report of five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even further improvements .
the next day , a newspaper reported that Erd@@ ogan expected to have beha@@ ved so bad as would never happen .
my enthusiasm seemed to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but a Putin des@@ irable , sustainable cold weather showed that Russia &apos;s head of head had nothing forgotten .
rather the cause of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in execution : the shooting down of a Russian struggle on Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was w@@ rest@@ rained .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to fell into the back of Russia .
it was even bigger , since it was committed by a real boy@@ friend .
building up again is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a sharp , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
once it seemed , the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the serious accus@@ ations made from senior officials , that Earth &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state .
he cont@@ ested this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place just therefore , because Putin was given the ap@@ ology to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind win .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is obvious .
Erd@@ ogan is primarily needed to get all the friends who can get , after the last month , in a failed Q@@ at@@ ari coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count towards a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the national television grocery stores fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports will be allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious in the West , as it was thinking about trying to resolve the attempted takeover as a weak answer .
to this end , the persi@@ sting Gro@@ ll on the escal@@ ator of the EU accession negotiations and Putin , which is pi@@ vot@@ al to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west .
in Ankara , Russia &apos;s Russian President won a bonus for providing a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat of support for the elected government &apos;s government .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow . it is self @-@ understand@@ able , that even has a profound fear of regim@@ es .
the summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one , as it once described me an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of outside side &quot; : two countries that stum@@ ble down from the West and feel badly treated .
nonetheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still huge differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently released the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey were actively supporting against each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of Turkey gave it deliberately to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear con@@ sen@@ sus on it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey gave the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders agree at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Board of Management , R@@ BS is currently being reduced to a back office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the bank has since dist@@ anced itself since they had to be abol@@ ished in eight years ago and had to be saved .
in this time , brand name &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the main headquarters and the stock market access will change to Nat@@ west .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private banking sector that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B is become our investment brand as well as to the brand under which our staff will be busy as we now employ more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we are not a global goals , but pursue local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer run his six Nations Sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop at the bank of brands , for how do we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Staff .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

I am very happy that it happened in New@@ market , because I landed some 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ers when he takes victory in victory
two jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys achieved the milestone in the obst@@ acle @-@ race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .

Russia &apos;s Putin smo@@ k@@ ered staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin presented his staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the narrow@@ est trust circle by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin , without stating reasons , has ordered his duties as Chairman of the President of the Russian President . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been an deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he graduated in Tokyo &apos;s prestigious Moscow institution for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s Embassy .
on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin ( in Russian ) , that he was later head of the head and head of the head of the government .
he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your confidence . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of law , to support the implementation of your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked his position to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made mysterious death in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time of the most eng@@ aging confi@@ dan@@ ese Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
in a meeting with President Putin that was aired on TV , both men said that Chief of Staff returned to his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the consequence of a sort of power @-@ fighting ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was praised as a potential president , once again became the Russian environmental policy - pushed into big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his comments on Putin , who are quoted at the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I had asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , I could say to me this very complex item - you almost say - compl@@ ained about four years to trust .
as it emerged , I have been Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council , a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Employment Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed to K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted .
once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could viol@@ ate Putin &apos;s second term President of Russia , since a third term Putin would viol@@ ate Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ bury Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion co@@ stly project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of the Queens@@ bury cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four promises of the &quot; Deck@@ b@@ lower , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 sl@@ ack@@ able parts .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion co@@ stly project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister for Economic Affairs , Keith Brown pays a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment on the construction of the Queens@@ bury cros@@ sings .
we are all witnesses of a engineering with a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the seal is between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total of the bridge at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks get a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck today , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of the For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first lock presents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure of cutting @-@ looking flood and civil engineering is dar .
after installation of the last street cover and its connection with the existing North @-@ deck , we then had to close the existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling on the northern ascent bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons , and an ascent of about 3 % had to be moved upwards .
heating , because the toler@@ ances where the team works , they were tiny - on each side , they were only some millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have good luck to be alive &quot;
three men were lucky to be alive , after they were thrown by her fishing boat in front of the town of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty to swim in safety , while their boat moved from own power .
&quot; we saw how the boat looked around and created the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have taken the boat except their reach until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved from a local fishing boat , while the third man had exhausted at the age of 60 and hung on a bu@@ oy@@ ancy without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of coastal boots and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said : &quot; the three men who have been thrown into the water are un@@ har@@ med and still alive .
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , the boat was lo@@ osed from the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
somebody told us today about these men .
seriously wounded - man sp@@ ends on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and injured .
as the police had ha@@ sted yesterday , the 50 year old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the non @-@ alcoholic and non @-@ alcoholic crimin@@ als cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he put into it twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
while the 50 year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished his sister .
together with their partner , the 45 year old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out with her life &apos;s companions .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ edi@@ atri@@ cian .
when the two women again stepped up the apartment , the 50 year old boy resi@@ sts his sister to his side and hold his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds brown &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green said : investors should be much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; manual concept living &quot; to the next rat@@ chet .
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a scheme is missing .
SPD faction of Christoph Fr@@ mann said : &quot; we are united with the Green Party : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments have to be found as social housing . &quot;
but the cheap apartments can , however , can be found in the stock .
the large disp@@ arity in the Town Hall is , however , the Brat@@ man : &quot; how do you want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new town@@ house building programme , which will cost millions of costs and will have to be financed , shall provide incenti@@ ves for incenti@@ ves .
the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CDU would like to do more than a few regulations .
the left still wants to do hardness , for investors .
regardless of this , the Brat@@ man , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept concept is implemented , it will provide for additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get specialists .
but the program does not yet fully understand : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compare the loss of another 1,@@ 300 inexpensive flats , whose support will be run out during the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the spokesperson on plan@@ ing spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased pending bonds from the city .
furthermore , we have to have thought about to get apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the West town .
solve this problem for a stroke .
the end of the year at the end of the year , at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be placed there in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : we don &apos;t want the owners , the residential companies .
since then , the number of social housing in the western city is dra@@ stically increased , removed from the goal of the so @-@ called flow @-@ mixture .
a concentration of social guards in just a few city parts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens calculate that there will be movement in the discussion .
leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke , S &amp; D leader , believes : &quot; a vast majority must follow the CDU with the boat . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what does not mean , it cannot be found yet a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and luck that pays off
it is fascinating , to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and child are no longer going out to play outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with it on the screen , was used in the last decade of many compl@@ ains .
in Pok@@ emon Go , people go to pick people from the sofa and be more active .
the time on the screen was at the beginning of the TV , then video games and last for Smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not exclu@@ de mut@@ ually exclusive .
I take part of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later this produced a character series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank in the interest of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries has been moved through massive demand , over@@ loaded the server .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphones on the outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are followed with a GPS , once they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; caught . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the wreck and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that re@@ covers the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch that followed 35,000 users , announced that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of those followed people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data for increased performance .
many public re@@ conn@@ aissance campaigns for health , people want to take part in a 30 minute time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the significance of sport can not be over@@ rated .
those who are using regular sports , reduces his chances to fall into cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they are fun .
consequently , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people join the hunt even new friends .
as always there is m@@ ür@@ cher game per@@ oxide , which must always be compl@@ aining about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it to do ?
a breakthrough has happened .
even if using smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier we could follow up our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal , and the use will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed .
however , due to poker achievements , however , there will be more games that will unite all apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ gy
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast invented the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes , under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team kam@@ er@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the US $ Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ rets at the Schwe@@ er@@ bal@@ ken during the single multi @-@ campaign of women during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi@@ war@@ rior and overall the fifth , while they consoli@@ dates their reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success makes them in the same league as unique ath@@ lete like Michael P@@ helps , which brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated the last three years of her sport art - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - which is a mixture of amb@@ ition and precision that she said , &quot; The Best Tur@@ ist is that I have ever seen . &quot;
it expected them to be a final test in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
American female Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ cing , after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ balance of women during the 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil and Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she worked for the farewell celebration of the team co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on top of its long way@@ point to have never planned the future , this isn &apos;t really true .
a part of its ground exercises - that contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is tailored to Latin American music , which would fit at home at the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school tour in the gymn@@ asium , was made into force in Bo@@ or@@ man .
since summer 2013 she has lost no multi @-@ campaign competition , winning a series of victory , which is as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two turns , the picture was d@@ ull .
pig beams and floor layers - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - no@@ ises .
she repeated the road again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her as her En@@ der@@ ous - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow in fine red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in their collection book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of team capit@@ ulated by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; an advantage .
after exercise , she threw the audience to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which was sometimes dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for this reason , twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a completely new meaning from the start of this week :
police : 3 cas@@ u@@ alties in series mur@@ der@@ ers at the music hear by car
according to police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of production , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a pilgri@@ mage , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fired weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another car , is reading in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that the shooting gallery led the investig@@ ators to become an immediate look at whether they are connected with four previous att@@ acking .
a total of seven attacks in nine attacks were killed in nine attacks during four months and two others were injured .

Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the fo@@ undry , which aimed at an empty Pick@@ up truck a half hour prior to the three @-@ fold murder and out that it was the production of the series production .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat , as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with a micro @-@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but like the least of his aging , Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let myself down .
what is not true at all -- of course , one has left out , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Edmund can never see her under any circumstances and that he might not survive even .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed him to be institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with a help .
Edmund could neither sit down to his third year neither sitting nor cro@@ oked , and he still cannot speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run and go cycling .
he too loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language , but Edmund für &quot; Please sing something out of &quot; thought . &quot;
&quot; we bring him a drawing language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical drawing language -- she says . Edmund has invented some signs .
micro @-@ cephal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic such as Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect life with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional prize of a uncertain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I have been asked for a long time since my progn@@ osis , because I don &apos;t expect someone really to say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for the mothers of babies with birth defects which were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it &apos;s getting better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainfall , floo@@ ding gives cause on rescue in Louisiana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call it on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned with more rainf@@ alls on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and south of the region flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the national weather service .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards dealt with that state officials are standing in constant contact with the local authorities and already on the way for the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared the inquiries for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality has requested Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa for ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over vast parts in the South Lou@@ isi@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service provided that an additional 3 @-@ 5 inches could be falling to rain in this area .
in the south of Alabama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it still ra@@ ining in the Mobile Area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Louisiana , will reach all odds over the weekend record pe@@ at .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many homes in the near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream was reflected on Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish , Ascen@@ sion Par@@ ish , because these rivers are slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of Mississippi state border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level ever recorded at 09.@@ 00 on Friday .
rescue teams still p@@ added people from the flood in the region Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his brother , were among those who were saved near the glo@@ om in Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water by Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly over night .

it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had lived there in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a flood of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he is the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency service had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought it to the next fire station in Glo@@ ver , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; had spread rapidly , since there were still heavy rainf@@ alls , and that the authorities would take into account the evacu@@ ation instructions .

&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed down due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents which hope to hold the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy &apos;s Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems like a similar incident .
in a tip , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of homes have been reported to be reported on Thursday , but the Friday have not been reported until now .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; ble@@ ached by balls , &quot; survi@@ ving shooting in Philadelphia
the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown has suffered several shots , including in the paraly@@ sis , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital with his transportation .
&quot; he has made a lot , his small body was broken by balls , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mil@@ iti@@ z on the broad@@ caster .
I can &apos;t believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the young family told the transmitter that he is likely to recover .
he would have planned to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot up in German@@ ia .
three men were shot at the same time : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in the critical state ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is found in a critical state , found on the broad@@ caster .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police have been determined whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a clo@@ ak between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ancing for the assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to different stor@@ m@@ ages , crossed the crime scene .
it seems that it was clearly tra@@ ded in a constant struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walking trail , leg@@ ses were located .
in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; part@@ iti@@ oned by the police station Anthony Reg@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
there were also several homes and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police currently exam@@ ines the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl hit the arm while she played in front of her home in the West O@@ ak Lane .
it re@@ covers and the police are looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present under the Frauen@@ balance in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that from more than one reason .
firstly , since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympi@@ ad and the USA were never so dominant .
and secondly , these team has three tur@@ rets , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Hern@@ an@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lics is , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has established the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport art .
in the last four years the number one was one A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and in America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Hern@@ an@@ dez as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ ro@@ chemicals .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold for women with a competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gym classes in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie defeated all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have four tur@@ keys in the team . in addition , Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer .
but the reality looks like it is a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private gym , which are maintained by parents , which are maintained for the training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the train@@ ers and their Turner and family ) .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in weal@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these societies the Turner will receive its entire training and that is a very expensive and long term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Hern@@ an@@ dez , have trained both of her athletes since she started with the tur@@ nes .
we have to be inspired by the congregations of Au@@ n , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to provide a performance and easier access to gym .
I have founded my gy@@ ms of 20 years .
in my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ ast@@ ics in Harlem for over 15.000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trains national and international vic@@ tors .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the young high @-@ quality tur@@ key , making the possibility of learning and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health , training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ der of the Olympic Team Championships and thank you so many young girls are motivated by a different background to start her way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organize further strikes after she rejected Jerem@@ y &apos;s proposal :
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the amendments made by the adoption of a re@@ formed treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who descended from an election , refused him .
in July , Hunt revealed the contract to termin@@ ate the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; which would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve maintenance @-@ times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ ment@@ ary for assist@@ ants told last night in a notification made by : &quot; assist@@ ants &quot; pre@@ heat the proposed contract , in particular , that it is the current occupation crisis and it is t@@ aming to treat all doctors justified . &quot;
only eight weeks left un@@ till , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts from the BM@@ A to solve the disp@@ utes by discussions at the government on withdrawal will participate , and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ ic silence .
this happened to a speaking hearing , Jerem@@ y Hunt made it only last month that his door would always be off@@ ended .
Jerem@@ y Hunt must act now to lift the vibration and the concerns of the assistance of assistance . &quot;
if he did not do this , so the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to implement additional labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw an accumulation of nearly 13@@ ,000 ro@@ uting operations and 100,000 appointments , because nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant doctors on the stri@@ kers chain .
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the amendments of the Re@@ formed Treaty , with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week @-@ re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ General of N@@ HS , urged the assistance to termin@@ ate the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures gain nothing of the only little , but already loaded up @-@ loaded teams and service providers , and prepare for patients , p@@ leg@@ ers and their families only , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months , we spoke to the Com@@ ment@@ ee of Assi@@ stance , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively to concern the concerns relating to the privileg@@ es and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hop@@ ed that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as po@@ uring , flexibility in training , additional training for those who were of a professional age period , training courses , mutual recognition of teaching , advanced training holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day - that can reduce heart attack caused by heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 per day , after recommended by the authorities to date more people for a longer period .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulator has been recommended for a four years to further reduce risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulator has been recommended for a four years to further reduce risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting fet@@ thal@@ mic materials in the arter@@ ial walls that form cover@@ ings .
when the Bel@@ ag breaks it , it may cause blood cl@@ ots to clo@@ g@@ ged blood flow until the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots solve , it can flow through the blood flow and clo@@ the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .

T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ prob@@ able .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month period of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE health Technology Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack , or a stroke , often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively shows further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand information options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the design draft recommends not a treatment that goes beyond this period .
cultural , Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness and electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed from office last year on leaving a governmental report .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to it that widespread electoral fraud are ignored in Muslim communities such as a devastating governmental report today .
the former cab@@ inet@@ d member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber , for the evidence of electoral mis@@ use concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
the former minister of integration and local government , which is now a ant@@ rup@@ tive king , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters out of religious motivation would be so bad that the police should be allowed to lift off radio belts outside of constitu@@ encies in order to protect elec@@ tive voters .
he recommends that voters should take a identity card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , voters must have only its name and address .
the report proposes , not removable ink on the finger of a person when they give up their sel@@ ective voice to prevent someone twice cho@@ oses .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should receive greater protection , says Sir Eric .
it claims that the press should have access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official comm@@ it@@ ees or work@@ groups .
&quot; that is not only against electoral fraud , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Choice Award in the East of London .
last year , a special issu@@ ing court decided that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be home to a lit@@ igation against corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ tes .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on the cy@@ n@@ ical manner &quot; and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that the cor@@ on@@ ous obligation of Muslims should choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a desc@@ endant , in which one person cho@@ oses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the whole country .
he was ou@@ sted in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - at which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leaders of prove to prove identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on vulner@@ able members of some ethnic min@@ orities was exercised , in particular women and young people to choose according to the Will@@ ems to the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ ist@@ ical background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activist documents have to edit , in order to stop &quot; sel@@ ections . &quot;
the report given by Ther@@ esa May in earnings will also require har@@ sh@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters from your choice after your identification .
not removable ink on the finger of a person , once they gave their voice to prevent someone twice cho@@ oses .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are in@@ competent .
a three @-@ year limitation to an automatic postal code .
ban on political , political activists , and proposals for postal sel@@ ections .
the police have the power to lift up un@@ lock the elec@@ ting stations .
a amendment requiring an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation according to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( Pop@@ ular Act 1983 ) .
photo@@ journalist ban on election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the choice stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that employees usually go through that voters are alone in the cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case a criminal complaint was not charged .
&quot; the election court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , for a lit@@ igation against corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said .
he was found guilty because of a number of reasons - according to the high demands of the criminal procedure .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; check @-@ checks &quot; of the voting rights of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country bears as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled source of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities threatening this good reputation .

the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a watch on Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave that he has been listening to his childhood since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself saw no great simil@@ arity , except for the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy shared the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I think it seems to be a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more likely to enter the centre : the all@@ ot@@ ating simil@@ arity between the British vast Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .

not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others like the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
put theory in the space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;

the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed too quickly and issued a message .
we regret it correctly , that these statements were made , and that it was allowed to be aired .
last night , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed at our viewers on the show and our followers on the social media .
to declare one , Byr@@ ne &apos;s comments relative to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to them as person .
nevertheless they were in@@ adequ@@ ately and an un@@ fortunate picture . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to his mission and tried to just@@ ify his remarks , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment a moment for the comment I made for the comment I made for the C@@ BC Olympic programme , exc@@ use it , he said .
&quot; I applied to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not in relation to them as a person . &quot;
of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;

the buyers did not know where they should see , when a woman went out her clothing in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try sub@@ h@@ osen .
in order to exac@@ erb@@ ate the situation , she insp@@ ected how she looked in it , and pulled it back into the shelf .

&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they returned the under@@ pants that you didn &apos;t like it , as they put it back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she was nothing right , and went out and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect itself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before a weapon of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to circum@@ navigate with armed forces .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn off for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you withdraw from behind , you should then turn yourself as a first turning point , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and enter &quot; from the Line &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
seize the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with his knees to the vest and rotate , while att@@ ack@@ ers meet with pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backward while they set the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ ack@@ ers cannot shoot .
lay it simultaneously the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his handle before they move backward and make the weapon for him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see how it &apos;s Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ makes .
but remember that it is secured when rob@@ ber@@ y on the saf@@ est is to over@@ pass your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to travel his tongue in the dirty towns of Europe
a British traveler sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and th@@ ef@@ lex in a serious test - per@@ ched some of the so@@ iling and most controversial locations in Europe .
the present@@ er and it@@ ator Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a Euro bill , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
in front of any object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer in order to show us what he will interv@@ ene .
but the experiment , which was filmed by the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising outcomes in daylight .
the thought , the rinse buttons of a pull @-@ up toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with physicians and medical professionals to promote intestinal bacteria and his own health .
luck@@ ily nothing left behind , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by traveled across the world and ate such wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to rinse buttons of toilets , the task represented his immune system definitely underneath a sample
in the film he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slaughter water . &quot;
in the film , he was just a righteous man .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its propor@@ tions showed a lumin@@ ous count of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res capacity is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to turn after their lumin@@ ous count of 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have a weight of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel route &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ i@@ number of various locations like the bathroom
in the film he says , &quot; This comes the worst thing I smoked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will find nothing here , because it is in the inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company features Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Vice President for Snacks , juices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ j@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to have something new .
something that is fascinating for watching , and at the same time the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics explains .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings to us that we ended &quot; L@@ ass call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ ine health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way to consumers .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had done some of the things I have told him , like the Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian , to watch them and others , where this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty le@@ aks on film . &quot;
in one of the validity of the survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of respondents associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 percent said that they are using at least occasionally products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ gling social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a biological family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being rolled out of her property , sho@@ cked employees of the property had property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were emb@@ ell@@ ished holes , mol@@ dings were rounded down , rub@@ b@@ ish was ador@@ ned on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was ador@@ ned with the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the household management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was not able to repair any more .
she said , &quot; There was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I am convinced that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider because this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is it too .
the pair had three sons , who lived for a time in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had added the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , in@@ timi@@ dated of residents , drug abuse , drug dealers and excessive scre@@ enings , streams , and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , got an order for external potential in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under conditions , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the property , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the timber frames were rounded
neighbours saying that they watched them on the streets and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ u@@ ed them and her partner those week violent by the estate after giving them an extended deadline for 11 weeks to volunte@@ ered .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , saying that their lives was made to hell .
one said , &quot; They were ashamed of anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the many times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up , because it was so quiet here - that we are not used !
now , where they are at last , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it was the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where police was called in regular intervals , 20 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant ab@@ ins@@ ed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to accept their family , as del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
that was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions to be aw@@ ful in their neighbours .
I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , who have gone cour@@ age@@ ously with us and have made the information done to us .
I hope that this development is don@@ ate to some neighbors consol@@ ation and con@@ veys the message that they are not toler@@ ated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the floor
workers of the property management are now wast@@ eland , which sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police ra@@ ids a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis and scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in height of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine fine , after having been found guilty of the possession of a class B drug .
she claimed that the money was a grave of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 at a car accident .
after being without shelter , it was assumed that T@@ anya and her partners are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms on the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will del@@ og@@ ate Mi@@ eter , who will not keep the assignment of the house
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall was told that Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that are not to keep the assignment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the c@@ ops of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ iso@@ cial behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Donald Tr@@ ump dream ″ massive issues ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditional conservative federal states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave up short@@ com@@ ings of his campaign to former Republican Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire usually referred to as something expressed as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
after he has thrown 16 rival within his own republi@@ can camp , the Zweifel we@@ ars now grow at its success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong report on his can@@ did@@ acy , he took up his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can High bur@@ ners
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
a survey conducted by the United States from June of June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor were rec@@ ited by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton .
other institutions see tr@@ ump in front , but not with the gap , which is custom@@ ary for Republican candidate at the State of the State .
as endangered there are Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump respon@@ ding to the question how he wanted to stop to clin@@ ks : &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot;
and hur@@ ry : this will be &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is not doing anything else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if there is no place for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is ok , said Tr@@ ump further .
and then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , party Tr@@ ump should have threatened to submit to the support of his election campaign , it should not be able to present better conversion values .
instead of taking the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress more strongly under the arms .
Olympia : dre@@ ister Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test
the IOC wants to set up a disciplinary Commission for discipl@@ ines .
Ken@@ yan athletes are facing the second d@@ oping sc@@ andal at the Rio de Janeiro 2012 Olympic Games .
following an attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee ended up immediately to establish a disciplinary committee of discipl@@ ines , in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan func@@ tionary has noti@@ fied that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine test in the Olympic Village , under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ ets F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this is the team management of Ken@@ ias have been reported by d@@ oping controls .
the IA@@ AF world association has promp@@ ted the IOC information about the case to rig@@ orous their own investigations , distributed a IA@@ AF present@@ er .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation , &quot; it was in an IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to D@@ oping control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , who gave the sample and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I .
he was owned by the credit@@ ation of athletes , who stood at the list for the training checks of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan World Ath@@ le@@ tics Military Chief of Michael Rot@@ ich had been withdrawn from Rio Olympics .
he is alleged to have informed about cash payments of his country on upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya has been under the IOC in particular at the IOC in particular from the IOC .
at the announcement of the IOC more than 2000 d@@ oping control controls in front of the Rio games , un@@ noticed before the Rio Olympics were also noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into visor .
before summer , the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had brought low pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Beg@@ inning .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya received from the list of countries whose d@@ oping combat forms are compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ up nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports , ARD has always been raised again that in Kenya d@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
the IOC member Richard Po@@ und challenged a similar research analysis in Kenya , how he had urged them in the Russian track of Ath@@ le@@ tics .
this could prove that in this sport art area and systematically po@@ ign@@ ited .
Russia &apos;s athletes were exp@@ elled from the summer play .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salz@@ burger Fest@@ spiele proudly present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one master@@ pieces .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
the orchestra dig the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ one music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she remembers with melanch@@ oly with Tony , while the younger brother plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ates me .
first because it is unusual about musi@@ cally !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be there .
she says it in her song : &quot; I , Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I : Pret@@ ty and funny and B@@ right . &quot;
it is therefore clever , of course also n@@ ai@@ v , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character whom I used as a Roman . &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous generous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Dud@@ amel is an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
today we took the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York citizens didn &apos;t want it .
they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate the Judge Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land to the Supreme Court .
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands after his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority of majority in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is that the next President shall enter Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s successor at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
on Thursday , during a telephone conference , Rei@@ d said that Clinton had expected Gar@@ land to choose &quot; a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
he said a spokesperson on Rei@@ d , later that he would not yet talked with Clinton , if she had been nominated Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ t Team would not take care of a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia .

Tre@@ ats wants to make time calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine is working with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to launch a 1970 @-@ year Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but rather than famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 on their N@@ U Mus@@ es Calendar .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his neck @-@ magazine of Old@@ school @-@ play@@ boys distingu@@ ish@@ able because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that this calendar does , too .
&quot; we must return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classical nec@@ ks , where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Shaw in a press release for the publication of the Cal@@ endars .
women will want to participate in this project , because it is a beautiful artwork .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting coun@@ cils in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish congregation is expecting mass cur@@ s@@ ement
&quot; whoever does not fit and praised Erd@@ ogan , sits on the packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the appearing of the Gü@@ len @-@ draw foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany pays for short term with tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some cent@@ en@@ arians , &quot; believe the leader Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard approach of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass cur@@ s@@ ement to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government has already passed Kurdish floods in recent months , there were 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run .
after the twi@@ sted p@@ utsch stim@@ ulate more sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks .
many are going to re @-@ start in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ban on exile was the targeted annex@@ ation of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities .
this means Erd@@ ogan expected to increase the remaining Kurds .
&apos;@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ban on the government urged the government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ ogan and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ ogan critics .
I feel no longer in Germany last months for the first time .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are searching for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
fire mark@@ up as a Gü@@ len @-@ pendant destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics of the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and praised Erd@@ ogan , sits on the packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ aries , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ draw foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Education , the Turks had already identified the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers for political persecution in Germany .
at the reporting date June 30 , these were 11,@@ 386 people , and thus nearly 29 per cent of all were eligible for granted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , they are not found before war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are political , i.e. from a nation@@ ally side , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country tag .
they understood that in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
in addition , the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year .
because they are not so far : summer holidays , heat and land for a b@@ oll@@ ern struggle - that bit@@ es .
the loc@@ als , which are persu@@ aded by the sel@@ ective fighters , are on vacation .
most holi@@ day@@ makers in the country are on the way to Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not the loc@@ als but are not allowed to choose the land day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays we are helper to spread the posters , aerial ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and end voices , only effort@@ less .
as of September 4 , 2016 , the Ele@@ ction and last Feri@@ a , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is still a campaign for election campaign against people over the people .
the hot phase , if you can tell , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must fear his position .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CDU .
how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts down and what remains open at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 as head of government , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one looks at his major posters .
he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it had already his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , Se@@ ering has gotten cold feet and gives Merkel the blame for the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D .
your refugee policy , you &quot; We &apos;re going &quot; have accelerated the rise of pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office now .
the CDU with its top edge data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for the wrong time .
she invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents ; Merkel &apos;s German parliament is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; since it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s too bad to hear eman@@ ating from other corners of Germany once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the North East CDU was largely on the usual campaigns on market places and shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and air ball@@ ons .
that , then Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
the union also noted that , on the country , you s@@ ne@@ ying the base that it must be very strict , again a wire to the people .
you are on the left hand of the left , the SPD , and the Green Party : in the depths of the country .
the council of the CDU elec@@ tor co@@ ert to his mit@@ igation is , however , self @-@ de@@ bun@@ ting : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , any birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called for its SPD now to a particularly dedicated campaign .
in the p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election , the SPD still gained 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the gre@@ enery , small party , with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to make the jump into the country .
they make up a modern virtu@@ e in the holidays of holidays and embar@@ r@@ assed on the Internet .
&quot; online contest &quot; , &quot; he calls the state chairman Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green chi@@ ds apply to track search for local stim@@ ul@@ ants under the rest .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the peak can@@ did@@ ature , just cur@@ d with a hou@@ s@@ ebo@@ at by the Mecklenburg Temple . it also finds it beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ restoration : gas plants suffer from blocking
at speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is all@@ u@@ vial praise .
&quot; they made everything fairly low , &quot; says El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet gas station .
that is a super@@ team .
there is no delay too .
the construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the South at weekends until the end of October , everything should be completed .
the decision is also praised for civil engineering , for example , when it comes to the establishment of self @-@ processing drives .
since the building site was carried out on Monday to the south and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been placed , and the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
the down@@ stream due to the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the Deputy director Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ri@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ gh@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because there were many sha@@ des and were more intimate than the sign@@ age .
what led to them that man@@ ned trucks in living areas were fran@@ ken .
while the speed lim@@ it@@ ers were not adher@@ ed , the assembly demanded the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were significant sur@@ charges , &quot; says King , who made himself to be able to find out on the spot .
there have been two to three per minute dr@@ illed .
the high speed was at 77 km / hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site is gone , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a little sol@@ ace that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
people don &apos;t want to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 has under@@ gone a renovation of net sales , each one asks .
however , some more and some less affected .
those who have to do with the &quot; Final Custom@@ ers &quot; has been produced less , so for other companies , for which the renovation hardly had consequences .
also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; at most light decline , &quot; however , this also gives evidence that &quot; the course of course is missing . &quot;
most exploited are local spots along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , the owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
that is already existed already .
not only him , but all the restaurants have taken it hard . &quot;
we were missing the clients from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
the sales of revenue rose to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
road &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his collabor@@ ators have to be dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise rep@@ lied with the advice , the restaurant is prof@@ iti@@ oned by the advantages of the position on B . 27 . now , they also have the dis@@ advantages to surrender through the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where some more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family enterprise has been located since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the history of history .
that other regul@@ ars may now look less frequently because of the complex traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go up , it is also very nice too .
at the end of restoration work again , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt to come back .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 work on its customers for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its host in its long @-@ standing history .
work : six months of construction , that &apos;s brutal .
in the name of terror attacks on laws , the terror attacks is melted .
according to recent proposals , the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives a reconciliation .
all his proposals are politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Agriculture in the presentation of his new security measures .
they are calling for anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also involved in part .
but as the Minister of Interior , it was due to him and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sen@@ sus &quot; within the coalition .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was given a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before he presented his conclusions about security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , changed : that a new security agency is to take care of an encrypted communication , is not new .
not the fact that Germany must translate several EU directives on air passenger data and arms correctly .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is starting a second stop for suggestions that have not been to do with the SPD : he wants to un@@ fold sympath@@ y for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; dream of the CDU man .
he still keep this for reasonable and needs nothing , which has no chance for the co@@ al@@ ment partner anyway .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : it plans rapid proceedings for shifts and more possibilities for detention from man before deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should advance their smartphones and declare social media accounts for a security check .
while Dul@@ dings for the past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to do some worse than so far - about those who take off@@ ences or reject their papers to swal@@ low their identity .
some of them is politically and legal .
it also works even un@@ balanced and lets questions open .
and with some points - at the im@@ bal@@ ancing of ideas for example - the question arises : what does that actually do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be dis@@ figured that the ass@@ ail@@ ers were in Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
many people in view of the high number of refugees were concerned about security .
and things that cultiv@@ ate men , let themselves also be ex@@ cl@@ oned in election campaign times .
inner safety is enormous in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the safegu@@ arding is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
Union and SPD remain increasingly on the subject of internal security .
during the past days , it passed between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the out@@ fitting of the federal police , then via a security policy collection of some uni@@ forms of interior ministers , in which the res@@ or@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a turn from double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also lab@@ ies with con@@ cili@@ atory sounds here .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a turn of the double pass .
we met the discussion in Germany .
you agree , be not sensible .
and on a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional by all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable , &quot; is only to show itself .
there is quite a bit there that could provide for dispute .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing an internal security subject .
party manager Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes a full call for conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the certainty of increasing security . &quot;
another Volkswagen is still busy .
in spite of diesel models , the suppliers will increase worldwide .
it does not run in all markets .
during the return reaction , it is the vort@@ ex .
Volkswagen launches his deliveries into the second half of the year .
despite the diesel @-@ aff@@ ection due to its many brands and some good run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car company can continue to show an increase in the previous year .
but in July , the core brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe and loads the total sales , just as the company had taken away in D@@ ax .
worldwide , the brand was sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , the deliveries rose by almost one sixth .
head of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition to some core markets , it has also been given a department store to some core markets .
besides the situation in Turkey about the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote have also affected the EU exit from the EU .
in the US , where the first emission of emissions first escal@@ ated , there is also a min@@ us of be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue g@@ lim@@ it@@ ously through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition treaty was only 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles .
group leader Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to show a sales spl@@ its from January to July .
in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated using a software testing system .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , Volkswagen re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after the upgrade of the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
the coach station will inform the customer after the retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was in operation on Friday .
the reason is legal qualities .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models now .
this was confirmed by VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Finance last Monday .
the report was confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister for Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that in case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the upgrade no wor@@ sen@@ ing takes place , and all type of relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not as it was in company backgrounds .
for instance , in the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come in a workshop a half year after the retro@@ fitting into a workshop - and that would result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in addition to the customer inter@@ pret@@ ations , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage in some other damage , which is nothing to do with the ab@@ ass@@ in sc@@ andal caused to safegu@@ ard with any of the guarantee of any warranty .
therefore , VW do not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands punishment interest rates - as a second Institute in Germany .
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts . &quot;
the German Federal Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single case and sees no signal : normal savings would not be afraid to pay for their austerity Pen@@ sions . &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay a 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; said Paul .
he has been a period of 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to another , and could not be able to toler@@ ate it .
&quot; those lying in me at the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the banking manager .
&quot; I can &apos;t lay up for every million Euros . &quot;
he then continued the cost after the urs@@ or principle .
the cash simply dropped in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the banking manager .
most customers would have understanding and change to other investment forms .
only few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course caused considerable costs to the ECB . &quot;

some German banks have therefore increased their fees for depos@@ iting , credit cards or bank transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking Association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private consumers have to pay for deposits in deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany under banks and savings banks . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cliff which is slightly more luxuri@@ ously furnished . &quot;
&quot; it can be a problem for a small bank &quot; if they get free money .
founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund has two branch offices in Bad Goisern , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ mir , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region there are known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
the Bayern regional association of Bavaria &quot; are currently not known for any other banks to calculate an issu@@ ance for deposits of individuals , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst .

destination plates : who actually buys sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men middle ages love sl@@ abs .
before you get to the commentary , in order to ins@@ ure him under the p@@ seud@@ onym Non @-@ Al@@ le@@ In@@ spec@@ tor &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement leads from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most often re@@ pres@@ ting of sound panels is not shown to boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which would like to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all fore@@ sight , at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able cas@@ ual group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobbies : it has an emotional meaning : older panels keep their feelings rather ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a bust@@ ling road in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit before I stand , my hands hold and try something like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a close look on it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look on it .
even though the heart of So@@ h@@ os is slowly gathering in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were based - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand up in the immediate vicinity of several men in such stores , and try to study their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I spoke of Sister Ray ( data : two young women , three men mean age ) in the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels .
these panels , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , the walls of his living room .
the reason why he owns a si@@ zable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records when they appeared and again buy objects that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s that appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he is true that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and are happy to spend some time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much .
it is my truck .
We@@ z , 25 who works at Sister Ray , believe that many customers , which he meets with the You@@ go@@ v profile .
but he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ y , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and see again to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people are generally exc@@ used for their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to the record of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business just like Ph@@ onica , to realise that record transactions are a relaxing community of equality .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans are overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted record covers , from objects which are happy and happy .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material poss@@ essions than a kind of sol@@ ace , &quot; says We@@ z .
that is with me as collector so and I think it &apos;s so in many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; sol@@ dered one employee of a record stack .
a survey of IC@@ M had revealed in April that nearly 50 % of the people who bought a record in the last month they haven &apos;t listened to .
the survey also found that 41 % had a record players whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record is no record players .
at this time of the news report , I would look very worried while I flo@@ wered in a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova Kom@@ pil@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ ar .
&quot; someone only arrived here and said , &quot; I have no record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record top , so I can put them in the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening .
more productive , less musical @-@ intensive .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record players . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which will start slowly .
fen@@ ter , which has dedicated to the sil@@ ver@@ plate nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I am pur@@ posed .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists that make photos , teenagers and women aged middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts neu@@ ros@@ oph@@ onic pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks strange , but brand psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard @-@ determined if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the shop for a few minutes and viewed the vari@@ et@@ eries for sale available .
she is rather a shov@@ el fool than a big one .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so the collecting plates are not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loved sigh@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I admit to cour@@ ge the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young te@@ ens who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of sheets of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them itself - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to receive them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry , and some customers can send in the depths of So@@ ck@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also that one is most suitable for luxury objects like sl@@ abs .
even though my research results showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in Pl@@ o transactions in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record holder , which exist in reality , record shops , and online searches , not taken into account .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security , not by ram@@ bling through record transactions of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves , while they face an infinite , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false host who rises above the shoulders of an older men &apos;s middle age .

French Court ref@@ uses to take over demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
in a trial hearing this week argu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the government should carry out to sell 72 billion businesses within the camp goods , selling stap@@ le services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a couple of euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy , which would be paid no taxes , which can be paid by fire and risk of fire .
humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important since the free meals , which are offered by government supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
they also led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 Pro@@ visional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are absolutely im@@ itable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than to feed people who live &quot; in extremely pre@@ defined conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
one of the places threatened by defe@@ ating was the Jungle Book Kids &apos;s Café des Camp , which is generally owned and spent 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as an advice to asylum items for the hundreds of vulner@@ able people aged in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the pet@@ ition to keep the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot;
the two aid agencies help refugees Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants voted on Friday that the number of people in the Dsch@@ ung@@ ell@@ ager living to more than 9,000 people have increased - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of Neu@@ ank@@ ö@@ mm@@ ets during summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be set to the next generation speed measurements : in different states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening devices are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic stri@@ ving en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example , in case of accidents that would be dangerous for a mobile measurement .
for example , on highway construction sites , or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary he@@ itter to comply with the speed limit .
a durable mobile construction can be too dangerous , or consuming .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring mode , the case data will be transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously in several tracks .
variable speed lim@@ it@@ ings as well as drive verb@@ ose to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the original condition , one can move the trailer with each car with a trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply chew@@ ed , it is lowered by measuring tools , so that the wheels in the pan@@ mo@@ cks and , by the way , van@@ ish the safe outer cover .
moreover , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ ake off V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 units last year .
great Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ he Rug@@ by , after losing master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ acon Stadium in Rio .
in Fiji we scored a masterpiece in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line and ro@@ her force to win gold - its first Olympic Games of any color .
the defeat was sil@@ enced by the not too bad tro@@ t of silver medal - Great Britain fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ final on the same day may fall back to them in the final .
but in spite of this , I would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in top shape .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not be - that at least a bridge will be a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Head of Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult way behind .
she lost eight years ago with Ryan each game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this cap will hurt you , but the progress is amazing .
in Fiji they were wonder@@ full and the attacks carried out by GB@@ S out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , when you run in driving co@@ aches . the World Series winners came from 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went up in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he turned into .
there are 12 @-@ 0 and GB hard for the ball .
a short T@@ ackle T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain by man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a placed a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still more than one minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ al@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ fied by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fiji had been born to play 7 , while UK still has to be learned .
it is like that .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time through and decided the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started a attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran out too long in favor of the South @-@ cons@@ ulate , whose fans sang , b@@ anners and d@@ anced at the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to see the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame put the i @-@ pin with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff no@@ ff , the fi@@ j@@ is im@@ pover@@ ished and GB , cr@@ ushing defeat in the grass .
in the past days , Fiji had defeated a semi @-@ final match with 20 @-@ 5 over@@ lap and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ k in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on interrupted the line with an impressive foot work and achieved a gate among the position in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , assured the profit - and thereby the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning who insp@@ ires the fight with the cancer of the train@@ ers
there will be no worse gold than playing with these games and that wants to hot .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the rest , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the sport@@ sman Robin Williams , was present at the second Olympic team in a row without tax conc@@ ub@@ ine , the first women in the history of British Sports that put on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ s is unbe@@ aten , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of tails , what does not reflect the kind of triumph@@ al .
behind every gold in the Ru@@ dern there is a batt@@ ali@@ on to consent , which make the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who would not survive the day 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could comm@@ ence the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the correct concept under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incenti@@ ve .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
that is how it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even greater .
in the in@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts arrived on Williams , who spent a nerve in the morning something more than else and thus trying to handle his own fears .
st@@ anning who used as captain in the Royal Artill@@ ery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan &quot; said &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean to me , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you on him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would have no better person for coaching or have a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and Heather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with whom their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get caught away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for doing something T@@ oll@@ es .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take for a year before making decisions about its future .
bells must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of Steve Back@@ rever@@ b .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
in London , it took approximately six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
everything was so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity su@@ ck@@ led
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as a &quot; Bavarian &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fr@@ atable drinking water @-@ purpose water as an example for the great water producers .
so it was in front of some time in the original in a piece of Bay@@ er@@ isches Rund@@ fun@@ ks .
a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia was killed .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group was &quot; Bavarian far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years of working collabor@@ ator , is 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 locations and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants .
the congregations are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water suppliers for further cities and communities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ ume &apos;s Mayor at Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was recruited as a water @-@ keeper in 1985 and has been appointed CEO of Zw@@ eck@@ d Büh@@ l in 1985 .
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extended by the water management and maintenance work on office and organization management , the bud@@ get@@ ary plans , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency extensions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the land under the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the restoration of the containers ( 1999 ) , the re@@ development of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes .
there have been no breast@@ feeding , and I have always taken new developments because water life trem@@ bling and drinking water is the most important food .
in their eu@@ logy , they praised G@@ ault , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used himself with plenty of heart disease for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived with water @-@ purpose , as if it would be its own company .
just a few weeks ago , he was able to present the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group on the nit@@ rate of the nit@@ rate of the district of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
he has received much recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the other hand praised Water@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper , and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
the highlights from his view , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau , and the re@@ organisation of the square .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult were , however , in front of the reservoir at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here it had to work throughout the night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water .
moreover , the supply of Neu@@ brunn was to be maintained only because one filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ches .
the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose system was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who would succeed Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Netanyahu is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine made major progress , &quot; said the 44 year old in the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot;
when the disease was diagnosed with her son , they believed that they should die .
the now eight year old Ti@@ ago had been well ahead and learn to be private in New York , where it was the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; to give an example : if I wonder something that &apos;s going back two years when I sang at the Milan Scala , he reminds himself of nothing , &quot; Netanyahu said .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ e@@ de - man sho@@ ots to his partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man on Friday killed 10,@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and wounded them fatal .
&quot; the man called himself with us , and given to shot his life in his life , &quot; said police woman .
the perpet@@ rators are on the run , after him may be proclaimed openly .
nationwide nationwide , since Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters in size , muscular , brown , and has a gl@@ are .
meanwhile the police has released a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man carries a gl@@ are .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon for himself , so the police .
he who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship &quot; .
the victim was born in 1988 , and the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the Croatian police in Lübeck initially wanted to make no further information about the le@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims . however , it confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a contradiction . &quot;
&quot; we do not say &quot; more than that , &quot; said police woman in Lübeck .
according to witnesses , a special police unit ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .

financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the wast@@ ew@@ rom @-@ funding are from the table .
it may remain in the liberation of renewable energies moving in the inventory of the so @-@ called inher@@ ent energy production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the Western German General Newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations last two years . &quot;
the European Commission originally planned to initially establish steel manufacturers , which would use gases from the blast furnace for power generation to fund their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission to talks with Competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works will be replaced , an EEG lev@@ y ratio of 20 percent must be replaced .
but even these will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission to its own generation .
thus , the status quo of the previous rule is largely written .
this particular importance has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; in view of our campaign &quot; steel is the future &quot; that is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more needs to follow . &quot;
&quot; the IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann , stated in Frankfurt , are also weak@@ ened with the reform of emissions standards , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
the steel industry in Europe has since been suffering from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressures since the financial crisis 2008 .
last year , the situation became worse than the world &apos;s largest producer of producing domestic demand in the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concerts Preis@@ d@@ umping ahead .
during this spring of spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
for example , import tari@@ ffs on import @-@ carbon effect , for others , economic prospects have emerged in China .
un@@ clear , how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
German industry @-@ pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp still was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
last the prices have been stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de individual works of single works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced less than six percent less steel than in the previous year , as the German @-@ German economy ha@@ sted Friday .
after a short increase in May , the volume went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates an increase of increasing emissions in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing senior citizens good
the S@@ ingen has accompanied her life as her whole life : when a young girl was her in the school choir , she attended the subject of music , and the 78 @-@ year @-@ old plays the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in an elderly choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and lively , she tells her .
very next , she does something good for her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen , S@@ ingen is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler , from the German senior League .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with equ@@ ities the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
through the regular meetings , seniors and social contacts can establish and maintain .
because there are often social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience was made by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organise themselves on the other , and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cl@@ oning . &quot;
singing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing , senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
whoever calls on his lungs , is not so fast in everyday life as quickly as the pu@@ rest .
even if it &apos;s about to get the sound of the voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz stated by the unemployed community of the seniors .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , explains them .
L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people are awak@@ ening , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through song lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people are de@@ structive to long @-@ present events .
when singing , a special performance is required by the S@@ ingen , says L@@ enz .
at the same time , focus on his own voice and to a given rhythm , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , practice themselves , do not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through singing in choir , H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing together in the choir .
to show yourself : if I have long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , so there &apos;s enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , does not betra@@ y L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 sin@@ ful people who hears it when a tone does not go to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , senior citizens have various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone singing from the circle circle in a geri@@ at@@ ench@@ or , you can easily connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in a cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ ical choir , can turn directly to the church or the church subur@@ b .
many senior teachers are also found via the Internet .
if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask help with the Internet .
those who want to sing , should be connected to a choir , advis@@ es h@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul good and liber@@ ating something - that is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect the calls of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise , the male also didn &apos;t get cold , however , they always remained in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the efficiency of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys on the cleaning of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster at Lau@@ te von K@@ itt@@ ens who found themselves in great need , as scientists from the veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) have found out .
cat also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the flow of less and strongly encouraged young for the males either is not perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H .
it is the first auth@@ ori@@ ent of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the K@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ams differ with the effectiveness of their assistance .
a total of nine adults and eight female servants were observed from the MH@@ H animal housing .
they were played for a herd of small children , which were taken for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to others they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger K@@ itt@@ ens , which were also lifted .
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they swi@@ vel@@ ed faster for the speaker , when this calls played the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be an@@ born or developing with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise that the males re@@ acts at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
in doing so , some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , just whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist of Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; by Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür in Turkey .
he was accused of being a terrorist group .
the first time after the attempt of attempt in Turkey takes place an important soccer game in Turkey .
in front of du@@ el the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is predicted .
even with the suspension of withdrawal according to the crash test in July , the government , the daily rout@@ ines , should not be imp@@ aired .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempt of attempt .
even before the football , it is not made .
the public prosecutor issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür .
in the meantime , the South of France is accused of being accused of a terrorist group in America .
in the south of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the president of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len will be responsible for the coup attempt in President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ ogan .
although the emergency condition is still valid for 90 days until October , actually the life of most Turks , but as good as no effect on the life of most Turks .
the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places around the country has declared Erd@@ ogan on Wednesday for an end .
sport is like the whole country - divided in tra@@ ilers and enemies .
especially fans of the club @-@ club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the Great &apos;s Gro@@ s tell the dramatic experience in history is strict de@@ jection of military p@@ utsch@@ es .
even the fans themselves agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
he will come back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski , during poker winner , &quot; Gala . &quot;
the Köl@@ ner established its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , the 31 year old finished his first time as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atik &quot; rejo@@ icing it : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the disap@@ pointing year of the record company found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after the Vor@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also emerged in the Europe League early .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was only to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it , and that is the most important thing , &quot; says Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Game year was better for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who had 26 season of seasonal h@@ ers as a Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ shake , the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , at the AC Florence , under the contract and occupying Bes@@ ik@@ tas only declared Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; k@@ icker &quot; Club@@ head F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
but it would have to be ready to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of its estimated annual salary , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; his salary at Florence , we cannot pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have even medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was closed twice for d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other leading Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh at this - they struggle in Rio to medals .
the topic d@@ oping is determined by the head@@ lines at Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had compl@@ ained after a d@@ oping lock her grid right shortly before the games , was blin@@ ded out and hat@@ ched at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
it was a sculp@@ ted Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a super@@ bly sm@@ iles , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when determined that they won &apos;t take gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ et .
but there are numerous other sport@@ s@@ men , who go to the start despite d@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m / s@@ quad@@ ron / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in ath@@ le@@ tics .
he was locked two times for d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his B@@ ann the Olympic champion in 2004 and Ex @-@ Champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock on after taking the pain relief using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after having had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended Himself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ Info / Croatia ) : 2011 , World Champion of 2012 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested on the prohibited stim@@ ul@@ ant agent of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic suffered the know@@ ingly in@@ gest@@ ion and was imprisoned for six months .
the four most popular lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ored .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m / season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , has been tested positive and imprisoned in 2010 for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement must have been responsible , Mer@@ ritt Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 metres the world &apos;s fastest man .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ d , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete could be retro@@ spec@@ tively known as many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his WM title of 2005 , nine years later , after having found testosterone d@@ oping .
meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave the 2004 Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid de@@ op@@ ings and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
in 2008 , the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the 2008 Olympic Games gained back because of a verdict at the International Criminal Tribunal of the CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 metres he is ranked second in the world ranking list .

Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian People - hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood up with his wife , said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they had suffered a sn@@ ug@@ s , and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this back .
it planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und for early September .
whether other explo@@ sions on the visitor island Phu@@ ket , as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , Austrian citizens are being affected , is not yet un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stood in relation to permanent contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at some 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok H@@ in , two bombs were explo@@ ded on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai change was killed and approximately 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday , two war@@ nings went up again , and the authorities were killed another man according to the authorities .
even Phu@@ ket was reported in the morning as a bomb explosion .
in the Det@@ onation , a taxi driver was wounded within a taxi driver near the popular beach train .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed urban staff .
according to the authorities in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ in@@ ct of the coastal police , the explosive police went into the air .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the south @-@ east coast of several injured .
there was one connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bom@@ bers carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Staff Cour@@ ts Dan@@ ai crit@@ im@@ av@@ ee Friday before journalists .
&quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot;
it may be too early to express itself to possible moti@@ ves - this is likely , however , the acts of Muslim rebels .
Thai media , too , wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical of the bom@@ bers of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the terrorist attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist asc@@ ension movement or with the international terrorism .
&quot; this is just a local sabot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have received sec@@ rec@@ y evidence in recent days sec@@ rec@@ y evidence in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact date and places informed .
still be un@@ clear , what group is behind the attacks .
the police rejected their officials all over the country , security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment venues .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the well @-@ founded bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on his homepage to make the instructions of Thai security authorities as a result .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary trips in these provinces are dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday performed a few days after a conten@@ ti@@ ous referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this dream of the military became a great influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody rest , keeps himself good to have brought back the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the military in the extreme south of the country since years .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
some years ago , in Bangkok there were also killed in a attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Shr@@ ine . most of them were foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the younger history of the country .
the rights of &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is in visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several offices , the Constitutional Council also set the group under observation .
&quot; we see the &apos; Ident@@ ity Movement &apos; for efforts against the free democratic principles , &quot; said constitutional President Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate , the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , a dis@@ astro@@ us Islamic faith , or from the Middle East , are diff@@ am@@ ised in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; multic@@ ult@@ i W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ coming . &quot;
Constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority has worked closely with the state offices .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; to pick up their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Head .
generally , extrem@@ ists try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists , as well as legal extrem@@ ists .
this is no question@@ able advertising for its own cause .
the propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emot@@ ionally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
recently , there were reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; of Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , any possible contacts of this species is relevant until a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - through certain people , the extrem@@ ist , changes their target direction , and is so extrem@@ ist .
so crucial , whether such people have contributed to the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view to the significant increase of legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new sense of terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that it can give judicial structures .
there were the &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may definitely be that further legitim@@ ists of groups or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee storms or attacks from other right @-@ extrem@@ ist moti@@ ves are planning .
however , a German @-@ wide or European controller of juris@@ dic@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were developed on the regional level or in social networks .
in fact , they expressed that many convic@@ tions on the account of people went to appearance in the right scene before .
that &apos;s the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or tra@@ ilers of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed off@@ ences , who had previously agreed before with the right extrem@@ ists who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or left , who were then radic@@ alised through the extrem@@ ist mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is appointed to the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympic Games or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the dis@@ cour@@ age@@ ous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros with summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics center , the light @-@ important s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it just van@@ ished - no matter how far the sni@@ pp@@ et had been selected .
in the social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral inter@@ ne@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 Star@@ ts .
but it was rather his not a sporty figure , which attracted attention to the attention of international media .
why did the 24 year old take part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was entitled to a special launch by international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ merged countries .
as in O@@ th@@ op@@ ies the most men walk , Hab@@ ed just wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it is ready for the great race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the whale . &quot;
based on a &quot; welfare state &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; gave him fun .
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres fre@@ estyle , there was no role .
compare with &quot; Eric the eel &quot; were also drawn .
the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i attracted media attention at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to compete over 100 metres fre@@ estyle by an out@@ run .
the fr@@ en@@ etic was fired by Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was able to swim for eight months before Olympia , and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

who will lead the market research company now , is still un@@ clear .
on Friday , it was the case on Friday where the shareholders had been the dis@@ appointment of the re@@ lu@@ ent successes of the years ago re@@ structured .
since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K .
&quot; the fruits of re@@ structure are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it .
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , every participant was sometimes un@@ quiet at some point .
&quot; if that would be the case in BMW , that would also make the odds , &quot; said it .
the company had , after set@@ backs in the preceding quarter , could not stop his loss of loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level of last year .

accidents - bus sli@@ t in scrat@@ ch@@ urch@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
there were eight people injured in the morning of an accident involving 43 elderly passengers and passengers on Thursday ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , distributed the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to show her data according to an agreement that was partly on the track .
the bus departed from the road to the right and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six lif@@ egu@@ ards and an emergency service came to the accident scene at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the uns@@ at@@ is@@ trav@@ ellers were brought back from a line @-@ bus back to the Cor@@ si@@ can district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare drive of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators sought the load experience and witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meters are from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ enk@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ tec 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
upon the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage costs will again be increased once again , if appropriate improvement should be necessary .
after a vast calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the permission of the domestic product was established by Land@@ scape and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for these se@@ wage plants under@@ go underground .
due to the legal basis , the market Kas@@ endorf is committed to operate the facilities .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from world leaders , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to lie lower in the pur@@ se .
the fee @-@ heights are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Directors Herbert Schmidt on the panel , a re @-@ stim@@ ulation of the fees for se@@ wage systems was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , there are also over@@ - and sub@@ covers from the previous cold development period .
the serious bre@@ wing @-@ cav@@ ities established Schmidt with it that there are relatively small san@@ itation systems in all three se@@ wage plants with a very low wast@@ ew@@ age dec@@ ay ranging between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters a year .
due to the low distribution base , for example , expenses for performing repairs of several thousand euros would be engraved .
moreover , the se@@ wage wast@@ es in all three plants slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , due to all three systems , due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair costs , in a considerable extent , please not last due to their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the feast , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt noted that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
for almost 20 years old support plants had to be over@@ hau@@ led by the pump on the pump . after nearly 20 years of operation the first se@@ wage pond had to be installed , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge is dispos@@ ed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; on these exceptional expend@@ itu@@ res came to take into account the continued professional and maintenance costs which are to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still clearly below the present level .
stone houses made clear that at low wast@@ ew@@ age in the three facilities supplied the expenditure for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
thus , Schmidt , the market leader of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain Prussian , especially since one can &apos;t extend the supply area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al plant in order to not extend this facilities because it is about de@@ fied sanitary facilities .
Bulgaria in Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % had been posted .
the annual average productivity of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , compared to pre@@ mon@@ ate a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; Mobi@@ liar , household appliances and ro@@ uting environments ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as at the advance of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as a Asian caric@@ ature crit@@ ici@@ zes
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers tell that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel compared to races .
with its filter tool , it offers Snap@@ chat about 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already ans absurd .
you can transform themselves into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ refined , self @-@ winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ector per day .
all failure to get to the public .
snap@@ chat @-@ filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused that the app , Black@@ face encour@@ ages or white skin to become a beauty ideal .
when it struck a filter in some users this week , which gave them sl@@ ot@@ au@@ ght , false teeth and stran@@ d@@ ling che@@ eks , they called it some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; sm@@ ooth@@ ills . &quot;
they asked if these repet@@ itive contro@@ versy raised to a larger problem , that the company has a diversity .
the news and indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat claim that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered a ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to An@@ ime characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ veness , the rac@@ is@@ ran@@ us , remin@@ ded the filter to viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
others have decided the An@@ ime comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American college student , whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos that the filter was inj@@ uri@@ ous and mil@@ dly said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the return of a very resi@@ li@@ ent Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow cat@@ ching has been drag@@ ged in .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that has crossed this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ z .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience for young people - who di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older opponent - might assume more of that sensitivity .
if one of snap@@ shots felt a picture is that for a user is offensive , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided that she is working as a manager and engineer for her , her Snap@@ chat account has called on to do the same .
in an interview for Medium and in a phone interview , she said that her racial contro@@ versy reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu crit@@ ici@@ zed the big part white , only male leaders and ended their essay using a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ u@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either do they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or feel comfortable to say what to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , that is mostly un@@ answered by the Snap@@ chat .
the company releases no figures on the diversity of its employees and has its status as private enterprise .
on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a speech , the company has set up a personnel manager , which focuses on sub@@ ver@@ ed populations and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu told her part that she will be closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military kidn@@ apping ISIS Intelligence information , asks Committee of Congress
military nationals of the United States Central Command post @-@ Chang@@ ed Information of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , listed in a report of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Advisory Council , Intelligence Committee and the Military Command , reported from great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Secret Services which reported their assessment to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida that controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news service information that were typically approved by high level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly identified a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it was the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses will be presented by our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
Cent@@ Com lead the lead to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed resi@@ due problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although it does not hesitate to change government pointed at Obama &apos;s instructions , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their accus@@ ation , an optim@@ istic image from the threat of the Islamic state , known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements made clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; said the report .
for example , Cent@@ Com was announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second @-@ second city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress of Kansas , Kansas , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the subsequent report to record the danger due to ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after them knew that analysts are concerned about mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , there are further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports by the general insp@@ ect of the Ministry of Defence in progress .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own insights in Thursday that agreed with some of the Republican Task Force &apos;s conclusions .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com was created a full limited process for the creation of intelligence agencies to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi Security Services , &quot; gave the highest ranking Democrats in the Kom@@ mid@@ ee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff .
this process , such as the ship , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; the mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; gave excessive space for sof@@ ter opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said there were no evidence on the intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analysts &quot; regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations into the Pentagon &apos;s Administrator @-@ insp@@ ect that were taken by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the general meeting would still be in progress .
but he also believes that &quot; experts sometimes quite den@@ ying opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues in the National Defense . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , had dropped out of the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest ass@@ essments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State remin@@ ders of disp@@ utes over the Islamic State of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com was questioned about how the former government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to susp@@ end on the after@@ math of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revol@@ t against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker announced the team at Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government points that , contrary to the government &apos;s declar@@ ations , there had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , because this provisional refin@@ eries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ atures because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the US win four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won by 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be actually a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in memory .
however , this is what they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equ@@ alizing in its group with the British on the first place that remained un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will hit the first round on Saturday in the last game .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which each of the two teams will achieve the first and second place within their group .
first placed , the strong Dutch will go slightly longer out of the way that lead the other group .
as always the game is going out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story , four years after the last London Games took place on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey club in their hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years ago she became a National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as it did not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came in 2012 , in which for her and her team , everything went wrong .
the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and began to turn things better .
&quot; change of culture , mental change and physical change &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work of work in London , which we now have .
we have embra@@ ced the ru@@ d@@ der .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India was without victory in the game without victory , but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the play from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game in her hands .
it carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ ded the ball into the US to make a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like b@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ami@@ dst the support of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , as late it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel stable and in@@ sof@@ ter , a shaving relay between competition and stri@@ ving .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el himself is a burning staff , who served as a tri@@ athlon for tri@@ athletes on the ath@@ lete &apos;s tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors within the queu@@ e shop , without using Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covering y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have might be sent under these known names that were sent to Prime Time , even if it would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ ist .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting with gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not univers@@ ally recognized : air@@ pist@@ ol chery , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may reign for long .
but when I should make a humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me turn the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ski@@ p had already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so me@@ tic@@ ulous that many those questioned , I didn &apos;t know that there is a Olympic port at all .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the United States sent ath@@ lets to match it , it has never gained a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 he had an ath@@ lete who made it to the end of the end .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to settle for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who share for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the Tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ el has a certain exterior charm , partly because it sounds for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a little enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ or@@ ously potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ ors of his never @-@ ending gra@@ vey@@ or - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two types that it essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , meaning as much means &quot; jump board . &quot;
clim@@ bers jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( thre@@ aten , h@@ amm@@ and sal@@ tos ) before landing at the feet .
they are assessed by the official Olympics program according to design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , outw@@ ard and over , sometimes up to the target , sometimes and back , upwards and down on the playground .
it does not only hunt the finishing line or the initial wall , but in the TV coverage another highlight : the World or the Olympic stadium .
the targeted stre@@ ak is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic , and it is enough to even touch a viewer &apos;s tears .
but it is also what I feel when looking at these games as a little ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is up .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she whis@@ per@@ ed , seem@@ ingly ag@@ ulated like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes upward , then effort@@ lessly to the top .
here also here is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves enter the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant raising of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the trials and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also found at 13.00 .
NBC shows the en@@ circles as part of a desc@@ endant blo@@ c after two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that will probably be over@@ seen in general tum@@ ult .
if the growth of consciousness can only be reached by the attack and object of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner at The Wall Street Journal , Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his home to the air , new fan base .
&quot; a generation of protest@@ ers &quot; in Ethiopia , long a consortium of the United States
violent protest in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers promp@@ ting political changes in Ethiopia to strike violent opposition in the government .
witnesses speak that three protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in fire@@ arms .
is Ethiopia tried to break ?
over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid group of West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the past months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was inde@@ xed according to human rights organisations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen trained to kill an armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos relating to the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security merchants are h@@ itting young people with impacts , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the leader of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated to be west .
American military and intelligence services closely cooperate with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror via the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa if at all , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in considerable speed .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was everything as an example for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , but dis@@ sidents were put into silence .
many were taken into exile , or imprisoned in prison , or put them into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress the people and they don &apos;t have other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints , that cover everything from the land use to the lit@@ igation relating to power of the ruling coalition .
following a far reaching crit@@ ici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time ten@@ sions rise along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this c@@ ud@@ dly , disputed line requested in June hundreds of life .
the analysts agree that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which could be forced over the past few years , could recover the turbul@@ ence and could be armed again .
several factors explain why feelings of dying after years of rock should now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via the social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more common and an Internet services improved .
even if the government has closed access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are in regular intervals , especially among protests , does , many people still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave up that they were assembled to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since the branches , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from branches of countries , are predominantly Christian high , in politics and economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ lands .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ers , accounting for around 6 per cent of the population , and those in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics are dominant .
the third reason for the distur@@ ban@@ ces is death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion leader , had died until his death on a non @-@ public disease in 2012 for 17 years , Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister .
he was considered tac@@ tic gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that it was particularly promising to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use Special Representative to process opponents , and to make them harmful .
according to the current regime , the current regime is lacking , Mr. Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es in a relatively un@@ clear reason .
Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tiger region of northern Ethiopia , comes to Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am coming from the south .
analy@@ st tell that he is not the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear , that the result will be more bloo@@ d@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced a pro@@ tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the indications that had been exp@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen by the government .
while the following ra@@ ids were killed , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months , and at that time the distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively fast .
development experts , Ethiop@@ ians leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , like new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measur@@ able progress in poverty ab@@ at@@ ement .
but apparently this does not prevent the intensi@@ fying of internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian Government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month attacked protest in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic town , of Tiger performed shops and hatred against the Tig@@ ers is becoming more common in social media .
analy@@ st tell that the protests in the US and other Western allies will bring in a unique position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently announced that it closed the base .
while the West wants to support democracy in the West , he doesn &apos;t want to unite his ally in a vol@@ atile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim Obama had been founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ versy starting on Friday , that his multiple repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would not have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication cast new questions about the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Presi@@ dential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fellow @-@ stri@@ kers to take an effort into protection during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the specific position , which he could not have meant .
having made the clari@@ fication on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the statement on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really does not intend to indicate that president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning Twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ic .
twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he thought the exc@@ use perfectly seriously .
as the conservative radio present@@ er H@@ ugh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted help to dis@@ close the statement by telling him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate wanted nothing to know .
the last storm of criticism lev@@ eled against Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct his campaign due to falling limits on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the business situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and found that he had found her talk boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he moved to strong criticism as he thought that the Russians were supposed to have been caught Mrs. Hahn &apos;s E@@ mails , but he later told &quot; Of course , I called the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then withdraw after demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test out how certain messages from his fans will come , as they arrive , and then they may define &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his testimony enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ sharp@@ ened the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even corro@@ sive tone since its values have gone back .
a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was posted on Friday , showed a leader of a huge advantage in the North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attempted to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics , to mis@@ understand his testimony or to mis@@ understand his humor .
but while he is intensi@@ fied in the focus of attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal fellow @-@ guns to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent inter@@ c@@ ession , was strug@@ gling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani thus says to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama had more than unknown , small organization before Obama named her back@@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved to Iraq troops from Iraq .
most Ma@@ instream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are attemp@@ ting to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , ISIS allowed themselves to spread themselves under control the situation in the Middle East .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and designed them to ride on each of his words and to be pres@@ sur@@ ised against him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot;
some of the Democrats sc@@ ott@@ le above Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologi@@ ze as only one more evidence that he was in@@ appropriate for the Presi@@ dential Bureau .
once at the price of the market , café is coming back into Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a rund@@ own café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay bar that had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business was replaced in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in form of cup@@ cakes .
loc@@ als there were as last loss in an genetically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ aster wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
but if New York changes is change , it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the publisher is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered to al@@ locate funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment again .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu includes sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there is natural dishes .
the café serves no beer , but there is fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez told that he noticed a st@@ oned stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on an Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself .
after the closing was closed , she gave her a while the coffee t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; it was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b who liked it , &quot; she said .
now they drink coffee again , even if they coff@@ ees at this day instead of their usual iced coffee , a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a pro@@ long@@ time and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went to work there , and he always questioned the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch , and they prepare my Everything Ba@@ gel in butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal will always get his usual order , but sometimes he changes his all @-@ bath with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not make a groove on the fact that the soap business has taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie b@@ lown to create a special soap for ver@@ b with the coffee @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; Rodri@@ guez .
the café also accepts the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points .
a new customer has translated the bill into Polish and Rodri@@ guez , that he presented them soon to make them feel welcome , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring buildings .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground , when the café graduated .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the rehear@@ sal and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took on his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt took a Fai@@ thful for refined delic@@ at@@ essen at Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Jane A@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ it &apos;s last book &quot; Ch@@ op Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the United States , while brick in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest cooperation , &quot; a decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with one reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ apps snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the IP@@ crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with oli@@ v@@ ets , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the reporter had h@@ ended h@@ ack@@ ers , this found the pair for a discussion on the meal in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; he said .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheeses and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , which stretches out the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts eat , that they serve as dinners .
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have been placed on the stomach as lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you can @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women collabor@@ ated for male subjects and it was served fresh baked pat@@ tern@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
there were Americans sent out during the first World War of food to star@@ ving Europeans . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws up the ways with which the country went , not to be the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the way that the new bud@@ get@@ ing was known : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and treas@@ urer were used to stap@@ le food , the treas@@ uries as &quot; wonderful kind , Ess@@ ential re@@ lics , &quot; it was aware that the ch@@ efs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by low weight ob@@ tain@@ er .
meat , for many years of the centre of the American kitchen , became a very rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutriti@@ ous satisfaction before taste or even healthy kitchen had been understood .
during research for the book , which includes recipes , it was prepared for a dish from this era , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was not a popular addition on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the business concepts .
as ever before or since then , household welfare - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
in keeping with recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to be transformed into &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary sp@@ ies &quot; and the challenge to transform p@@ amp@@ ons like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rot into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treats .
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s answer to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ stance .
while he praised the simple I@@ owa farmers in the kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ ear@@ ed as the million million@@ th man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked most continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a almost gilded dining room and wore a tu@@ x .
he was wonderful real@@ time alien .
perhaps President Roosevelt could have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the veter@@ an &apos;s house@@ keeper with no interest in taste could be emphas@@ ized by women that the White House produced the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most advanced food . &quot;
many of the types come from the era of great depression , to get into food , was rejected once the country came back on the legs .
on our continued focus on calories and food , bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as science was applied on food .
the couple had to understand the eating habits of bricks in law in law , for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
brick was rec@@ alled : &quot; it actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ breaks .
after the plates were cleared from Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e to have prepared a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roosevelt ate to lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody had a little disp@@ le@@ ased a spoon into the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E was three times a copy .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ dy he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed on bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save people &apos;s life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a facade @-@ bom@@ bed attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civilian group that had so far been delivered to almost 60,000 people , according to the image newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civi@@ liz@@ ard that shows him in a 11 hour rescue from a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about the bright symbol@@ ist in the horror of the war .
as heroes , he has never seen himself , said in the picture : &quot; for me , this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
just before Omar himself had an attack on the victim , he talked about the last bomb attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have thrown four facade bombs above the Alz@@ adia District , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the killing of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland &apos;s oldest cycl@@ ist is nearly 400 years old .
rare sight . more rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are usually only available in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Green@@ lan@@ ha@@ ie got up with 150 years of offspring .
in fact , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k flo@@ cked along the bottom of the North Atlantic with an average of 1,@@ 220 meters in an hour .
only if it depends on it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a wh@@ opping 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
such a strong lifestyle , however , seems to be a formula for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ orn@@ ate from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ graphic Research in Rostock this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
true , the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist susp@@ ects long that Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks become st@@ on@@ ry .
only the evidence missing .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are hard to observe , they are mainly living in the polar sea front of the spar@@ sely populated coastal waters of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures of the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter .
researchers want to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
her tim@@ el@@ ong@@ emp@@ o shows her , when she was equipped with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard for six animals .
prey make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up the j@@ aw of a young ice @-@ bears .
maybe she ch@@ ase them sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ bles at the bottom of the ice cream and look at Ka@@ da@@ ver who tor@@ ates from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long while the biggest 502 @-@ cm measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the age of carbon in the shar@@ ks with the Carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens occurs already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which the proteins contained therein will no longer be re@@ done .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a remarkable Carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
it was therefore , therefore , after the early 1960s , when the nuclear ar@@ aff@@ inity attempts to get bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in contrast , with 220 centi@@ meters in length , the lens only contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear ar@@ ming , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had a normal carbon @-@ 14 gas , due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ Clock showed an age of 335 years at the age of 335 , while the Rekord Ha@@ i with 502 sits even 3@@ 92 years old .
the fact that Greenland &apos;s shar@@ k females got offspring when they are longer than four meters .
now the researchers were able to as@@ sign the length of the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters are probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age at 156 years have been determined , Greenland with the multip@@ lication fall at least one and a half centuries .
this may also be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters , is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , an 211 @-@ year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ dge he@@ el , was caught before Alaska .
due to low temperatures , the body of the living animals often lives on savings .
so you mature later - and slow down .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume increases much faster than its surface , which the animal heat spreads .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of an elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
so a small animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as if you have so much offspring as early as possible , &quot; says the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist .
a very big animal should not invest his resources in a long life .
construction site in double pack
with topics around the building , the Municipal Council is focused on the latest meeting in the most recent meeting .
with relief , the panel adopted the message by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently reported resi@@ du@@ es can begin . &quot;
after the ground@@ breaking , par@@ zel@@ ing and closing questions were clari@@ fied , the sale of the land is available in the residential construction area &quot; Stre@@ et@@ road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section of Bin@@ der@@ straße - one of those interested in finding nothing more in the way ) .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction of the construction is in rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and ru@@ sty people alike .
as it was called , construction consent can be noti@@ fied immediately in the Town Hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to advise on its September session .
in order to support requests concerning the res@@ ett@@ lement of further commercial enterprises , the establishment of the job creation , the Municipal Council decided not to change the area plan in parts of this year in spring of this year .
in the area of sub @-@ time lar@@ n , the commercial area is established there by two par@@ c@@ els towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the City of Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies coming from London .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; Michael Vo@@ ig@@ saw , Head of the Compet@@ ence field Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether the funds will continue to operate from London financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU pass , the approval has been introduced to them in Britain .
they are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to transfer jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ age &quot; Frankfurt @-@ Main Finance &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the main course of five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , agree with responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance company E@@ IO@@ PA and ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but it is less important to the ECB &apos;s financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to bank@@ note bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ master .
even in Luxembourg , a large fund industry , however , will cut away worse , just as Dublin for the infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
the city will also be easily available for commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris , it is not that easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ ro@@ ses .
in addition to the Seine , the r@@ ents for top @-@ class commercial real estate can be 50 percent higher than on the Main .

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent lit@@ igation with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. counter@@ purpose decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal cost that you have created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

Clin@@ ica earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and figures 3@@ 4.2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton published their tax returns to the Democrats in 2015 , which y@@ ielded up for the presidential candidate in the Democrats and her husband , an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars ; former Foreign Minister granted an income of USD 3 million from the house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their ten@@ ure in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ pl@@ ess Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i was known in a statement .
in a conflict , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and decl@@ ines concerning his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations , even though they are not obliged by law .
ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given their lawyers as a reason for ref@@ using control tests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advisor , to CNN that he would not allow jun@@ ta to publish something before the tax tests are not completed .

on Thursday she spoke the subject , too , during an address to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; she said to the crowd .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid any or only very little tax in the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors that still could be the case .
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton also supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal also .
during a campaign event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate , requested his seat at a meeting to discuss their tax declar@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett stated that he was subjected to a tax review of the IRS and ump @-@ ump &quot; Fear &quot; in the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has now been published head@@ lines up to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ique now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , we paid an effective state tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .

Jewish director sm@@ ashing the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arabic &quot; refresh@@ ment - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ unle@@ ashed a media clock after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has no Israeli pre@@ fix in Berlin because it calls for Arab guests in a staff &quot; requested . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find Israel in the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries called directly from the hotel room .
how is it in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel eliminated and was extingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has an opportunity to choose Israel using a call center .
after an explanation , the director looked to the hotel &apos;s recep@@ tion@@ ist .
the answer he received there , &quot; he shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel stated that the intervention was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason , which was behind it , unle@@ ashed even more rage in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
that is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this is worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident also revealed a quite big reson@@ ance on the internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel stated that there would have followed the alleged extradition of Arab guests . &quot;
be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue .
the hotel quickly had all the accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; Ver@@ see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel .
&quot; never , &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel has not included in the quick list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the abol@@ ition of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran on the year comparison rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew sharply in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to proc@@ ure access to the market .
of course , further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran had risen by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade swing was achieved through deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign offices gave roughly 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel citizens , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists fall in Russia last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians attend Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received Mon@@ uments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner over@@ looks at home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ged last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ o@@ drome to the fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor part that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made herself too hard . the J@@ inn and proudly introduces the legend when he stor@@ med home , in order to visit a victory from the Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England , four years ago , claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ an medals .
they repeated the trick , having made it in March at the London World Championships in London despite the back of Ho@@ ys only a humble sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des .
ho@@ ys retired a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
S@@ kin@@ ner was the man who stayed with her when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots that un@@ folds now .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and S@@ kin@@ ner put an Olympic champion in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ di returned to his lap , but Kenn@@ y carried the team forward and S@@ kin@@ ner kept it .
a strategy of strategy made a large proportion of transformation , in the execution in a higher speed to slow down and to slow down to slow down S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked out from his position as a BBC specialist and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium .
the 23 year old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up a Olympic champion in the final round and defe@@ ats the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
following the triumph of 2012 on the side &apos;s Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was evidence that he fell down on the railway after a weak start .
he returned this statement later , and there was no ob@@ jection of England &apos;s rival .
during such an over@@ lap victory there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many global titles so that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is an barometer of our progress in the last five months , we are expecting successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the Form Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would mean exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a sacred date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that is the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy it for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels good to win alone .
Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be sm@@ itten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll be qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with security in focus on the second day .
yesterday , he fought against the qualification before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the proper women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and ended , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sel Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is reli@@ ed on its strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a crowd of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
it played Dr@@ amas in the background , such as the resignation of the technical conductor Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the heart of sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ be@@ aters , as well as the retired of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first night of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks very later than that now the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached its peak at a perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland , due to abol@@ ition of energy contract .
the future of aluminium mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria , as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at stake , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate energy providers and to lift all delivery contracts , such as the provided energy company .
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operation the plant .
a sub@@ sid@@ y of 20 years is running in November .
up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the complex of Al@@ coa in Portland stand at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
in addition , there could be dom@@ ino effect as the melting energy consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa finished the Point of Henry melting , which led to a cl@@ amping of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risks a cl@@ amping .
this step deals with many years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mel@@ ts with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ eral Valley , told that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is located in a majority owned by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina Joint Venture , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller parts .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting &quot; means , &quot; the company shared .
AG@@ L still said that the treaties were so called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 onwards .
the contracts entered the deadline for 12 months so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the current supplier .
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong dates for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it had already written the value of contracts already in its net closing in the amount of $ 187 million , &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa told that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ dom@@ as &quot; ... the melt of the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; could not be affected .
the U.S. company said that it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang that would have entered into force of November this year , even if there is still an explanation , why it is signed from the contract .
analysts war@@ n from the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland consume some 900 meg@@ awatts of electricity annually .
if both presses should disappear from the market , it would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .

&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers for weeping , &quot; wrote San Antonio .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , in the presence of Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ( with the exception of problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forgot the cover of her sister and ending with a classical programme : they all have a surprise party .
this represents the cli@@ mat@@ ee@@ ee@@ ee plot close to everyone &apos;s birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ nant provided the sentence , &quot; You did not believe that we have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of an animation by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) but Kris had to take part in that public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , we started a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an era .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes it to see what the V@@ ogue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West , to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for himself .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , rather resem@@ bles a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertising drivers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his coat of Co@@ uns@@ stars is expected to see that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ ist@@ lau@@ er and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine than the &quot; push @-@ model &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or young people from today who know how to make a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to j@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women looking out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover had appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success each .
with their reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been st@@ icker .
in June , the local Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and their colleagues called &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the Moment of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cook high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue cover .
but riding on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by the point .
San Antonio J@@ enner is on the cover of the September V@@ ogue edition .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
she makes advertising for her under@@ coat of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells from her made images from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine of LOVE .
and in their spare time , they will be seen in reality TV . presumably just to see their sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
municipal centers show yearly 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0.000 in the country &apos;s most common areas will be rejected annually by the municipal centres of the country , while the industry &apos;s impact on the effects of further aver@@ ages are already taken over on over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , there are already three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and procedures - with their request for free legal advice and legal proceedings .
legal services of the community , which are already fully utilized , are ready for further reductions .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose more than 30 percent of its agents .
the director of the Church centres in Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Centers revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a raid of the government would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ &apos;s Municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people from major services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who have left violent relations , people with im@@ measur@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive debt , families who were dismissed by separation , workers who have no wrong way and this survey shows that they can not get the help you need .
the federal government will cut the average by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of people need to be forced from Queensland with their legal problems without any help .
we demand the At@@ tor@@ ney Office and Federal Ministry of Defence and sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these aver@@ ages immediately , so the people who need them to obtain legal problems with legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal rights to the national average .
it is now time to view the needs of Municipal Centers and its Customer Relations , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : lose elections ahead of the elections : SPD and CDU elections
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU .
this revealed the representative surveys of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to reign in the north , this is not possible after the survey .
in both federal states , the SPD is the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only just ahead of the CDU , which could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed among the left and Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country .
despite minor losses , the Green Party declined by 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent earlier ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented in the country &apos;s country with 3 percent each .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD report only accounted for 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU was only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
this is still behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left at 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Congress of Represent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would be able to miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in time lu@@ des : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the followers domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kilogram , and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty big .
in the beginning , the built @-@ in store was about eight meg@@ abyte of meg@@ abyte , that would be sufficient today for about two self @-@ resolution .
an iPhone has now been delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , to the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , fans can buy the devices yet on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Internet @-@ time of the Internet .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hanover as &quot; office in the West @-@ bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for that time standards : SMS and emails were sent and received , even by fax it was communic@@ ator to get communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible by HTML @-@ browser when running slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could work similarly to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
fairly proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average price for one smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented sur@@ ge , was eventually sold to Microsoft and sold .
today , the market is well @-@ known providers that came up all much later than Nokia .
always be online , which is today for many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , based on Samsung and Apple alone by 5@@ 55 million .
the global market share with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications company .
a whole industry has grown around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was not beginning in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac @-@ World to launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , which can be easily served by touch screen .
the winner of the winner of Apple began , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group today .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the re@@ viewing .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian vendors as Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention .
today , every German spent 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we all need to learn the smartphone even , &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball in charge of the Siemens executive board .
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing as well .
England must domin@@ ate the Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row won &apos;t only bring in our local municipalities and throughout London , but to produce and prosperity throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we worked for a large effort to make sure all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be reached by creating new possibilities for local local companies and companies near Heath@@ row .
for our local communities , we are already present 10,000 new jobs , create 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were prec@@ eded by us in London 2012 , there will be such that would think that the challenge of the extension of Heath@@ row is too great .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blu@@ ish ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ aries had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to over@@ take , but Heath@@ row respon@@ ds to every question to him .
as the Olympic Games is Heath@@ row for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , creating £ 211 billion to funny growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in whole UK .
we have been a great team in Heath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 bn more expensive infrastructure programme in time and budget , from the T5 - which was built five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heath@@ row is also one .
it is time for us to domin@@ ate this Olympic spirit and Heath@@ row and create our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and jobs , to be proud of England .

ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ play &quot; on display block@@ ers
for companies that earn money with online advertising money , according to one of the software producers attempts to handle sco@@ re@@ ation , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ spiel . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block the indication of the indication on his desktop site , ad@@ block Plus a blog post , in which it claims that users could update their filters in the program to block advertis@@ ements in social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook told us that his Des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding page on his advertising , to detect the indication of the detection over which is part of the site advertising to make it harder to compl@@ ain .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams confirmed that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o fight between the pointing open source community and the env@@ elop@@ es have been in progress since the invention of sco@@ ot@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left for social media in combat is a strong indication for the industry &apos;s wor@@ r@@ ying indicators for the industry .
according to a survey conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , use almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook , a total of 84 percent of advertising revenue makes Fac@@ ebooks forth .
the company is based on display block@@ ers on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad @-@ block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker with them .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues , so the investment of a step seems worthwhile as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook told us that its &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; would have been ref@@ uted to have more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that ad@@ joining new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because they would also block any content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; for users , this does not represent a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a message from Facebook in an email message .
advertis@@ ers are a mute remedy , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with suspected suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday at a prob@@ able suicide bom@@ bed by several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred close to the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a Swiss lady in the age of 49 years , which had been transferred by several vehicles , including a truck car , wanted to kill himself .
it still died on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some have not been identified still , said the police , those as well as every witness of the incident to report itself .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , has given Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash prevent@@ able ?
that is something the prosecutor to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not drawn to the responsibility .
in each of the two cases - a person ran in the dark on the motorway - was decided that drivers not go out of it that pedestri@@ ans running in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a co@@ p was acquitted of the neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide , after having crossed over a man and killed one night on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
22 @-@ year @-@ old victims were drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the road , took the court .
the court determined that the co@@ p -- that had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable situation , &quot; said the Judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate @-@ model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus had probably inhab@@ itable the projections of a new NASA climate model probably inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorith@@ ms , which are similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus and its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once be identified .
scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , inv@@ ent @-@ like atmosphere and , nevertheless , slowly circul@@ ated .
the model also lit up top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but had once enough water and geograph@@ ic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and shake off faster dist@@ orted .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow movement of Venus reached their day leg of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , to shelter the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus that resem@@ bles evolution that had previously been acquired by planet research .
although it was supposedly inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over several billion years were exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans have ev@@ apor@@ ated and their steam @-@ vap@@ or was burned from ultra@@ violet light .
when its hydro@@ gen dischar@@ ged only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus that know how we know them today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer in the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and introduced a team @-@ determination right for decision @-@ making of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; over the last three years , I have duties as Chief Executive and Vice President Of hockey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ ants , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
I have thought about the summer long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the train@@ ers and Vice President of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a contribut@@ or @-@ to @-@ determin@@ ate decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his team &apos;s contributions to his team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Z@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him for the future only the best .
during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , the winner of the Jack Adams Awards were awarded as the best trainer in the league .
he led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the after@@ season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 39 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
the Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart won by Roy four Stanley C@@ ups -- two songs with Montreal Canadi@@ en and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ers again take talks on , set strike out of
the workers strug@@ gles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration of the northern overseas workers will be suspended , while all the parties sit on the table for a new talks , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were performed spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group , as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ mt unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ start the processing process of current dispute , &quot; says it in a common declaration .
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the next weeks that will begin at the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
since this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating will follow a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company are required to come across the market down@@ turn .
Shell announced for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alized its operations as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ ity to the BG Group .
energy companies are due to lower raw materials prices under pressure , an economic situation that would depend on the decision of the British in June to reli@@ ve the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers leaders in order to discuss one of the largest labour disp@@ utes , which took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in North Sea by an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ base of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with Kepler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of star@@ vation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data can help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating at different rates , as well as the planet @-@ time frames are used .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ base of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood .
now you are now turning the fastest .
leading stars , these mature stars contra@@ sts large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds go by magnetic fields of stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star turns out , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every star , taking the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- to know .
the newest version of rotation rates point out that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull are compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with older stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow fans tend to be massive , better for faster rot@@ ors , to be very bright stars , &quot; said rebellion .
as the star@@ base of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmetic laboratory to compare qualities to rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar press in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said rebellion .
there is still much more to us about how we want to learn more about how , when and why stars are slow down their rotation rates , so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
re@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star came off .
tears ran to Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base .
after his emotional review date , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will carry out the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12th .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I tell &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants in the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most precious player in the league , in 2009 he won the &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es &quot; the World Series .
his signature was 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of the contradiction on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach with a full content in the future .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) , the Seattle Rang@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays indicate just two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old would not yet be recorded at the basketball courts of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - S@@ nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his occurr@@ ence outside the square .
as early as 2009 , the Super@@ star gave &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; forbidden by dying of ster@@ oids to have taken place between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was imprisoned for 211 games due to contrac@@ ting in the so @-@ called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis Sk@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the major susp@@ ect for many years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a lit@@ igation , the lock was reduced to 162 encoun@@ ters .
&quot; the league could even have done for 2014 for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without any break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez was still sweet .
his farewell @-@ day did not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legen@@ ds take a great stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ insky are first dates
caught : because of a positive drop @-@ sample I cannot start Adrian Ziel@@ insky from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - Rio 2016 Olympic Games will be overs@@ ha@@ dowed by the first official accus@@ ation .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh place of competition the first official D@@ oping accidents became known in Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ insky have been tested positive and excluded - immediately before the start of the &quot; Ath@@ le@@ tics &quot; Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions .
Ch@@ en has been proved last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a cas@@ c@@ ading agent for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ zers .
the International Business Court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 year old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en had planned to take part in the qualification of over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing held at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &apos; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation in investigations , &quot; quoted by X@@ in@@ hua from a statement : &quot; we will continue working with the International Business Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
the CA@@ S for the first time in history is not the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of sport@@ s@@ men with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news spread about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old himself went on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; it was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete &apos;s ath@@ lete .
according to the report , it is said to act with the banned substance to act by the EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been suspended at preliminary sus@@ pending , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample is supposed to have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow promp@@ tly returned to critic@@ ise the ath@@ lete with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not move the right shots , &quot; he said , &quot; we have been under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
so , for example , all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ter from the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ ed nation could not participate in Rio .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was also tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both cont@@ ests the in@@ gest@@ ion , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another severe blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had its complete Russian team until an exception because of systematic differentiation , also the L@@ ists Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , these events in China had also su@@ cked in China for fierce fights even between athletes .
this follows the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang P@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle , I want to surrender myself , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
sun also stood at the centre of a meditation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping cou@@ sins , &quot; said this .
sun was positive in the Chinese Championships in 2014 , but had to be tested by the ul@@ cer@@ ess Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit in a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de be@@ press h@@ ack@@ ers her sol@@ ubil@@ ity
programm@@ ers of ex@@ pressing malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in this way .
according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once , partially multiple victims of attack with ex@@ tor@@ ment software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies had already been the aim of a ranks of the ranks .
40 percent of the victims were willing to use the solvents required by the perpet@@ rators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company power plants .
if they are successful there , the potentially stress @-@ money is considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; we are currently watching rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski explained in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the ex@@ tor@@ ment software for itself .
first , private users were the destination , but the change to corporate att@@ acking took place fast in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , they are looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos .
these files en@@ codes the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
afterwards the software will present the demands of the ex@@ tor@@ ists .
in order to obtain the final turn@@ key code , the victims must transfer the money - usually in the form of bit@@ umen Bit@@ coin .
but where at private use the personal photo database on the game stands , there are companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production will shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off when a Ran@@ som@@ ite makes .
22 percent of German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to under@@ cut business activities completely , in case people were in danger of danger .
in Germany there were already several hospitals in attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of nursing .
&quot; we say the victims always : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
for managers , it is difficult , given by stand@@ still in operation the demand of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the security researcher of F @-@ Secure examined the user surface and contact with the contact pressure and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you explain their sacrifices by chat as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they will be able to redeem payments from a few hundreds of euros , companies must share their share hard and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to reverse their data un@@ de@@ cryp@@ ted .
given the potential high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ al ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ acker is always professional and share the work , says safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus vendor SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person may write an Ran@@ some of about within one week . &quot;
more likely it is , however , that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware in the form of a software package to the real ex@@ tor@@ ques .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware itself , advis@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included in the scope of delivery is a custom@@ ization tool that allows for smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the ex@@ tor@@ ists then seek further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
one is thus log@@ ged in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set of a crimin@@ als and decides to install the software on possible many PCs .
payment is at a fixed machine .
&quot; in conventi@@ on@@ ally , the crimin@@ als are inter@@ c@@ ting with distribution , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
meanwhile , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known now with many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies employed by companies acting in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey do trust Ran@@ som@@ ware by using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
by contrast , the perpet@@ rators have already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful replacement for successful replacement , the perpet@@ rators are instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price tag , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the dam@@ aging potential , depending on the type of data , even more than before .
nor could the perpet@@ rators over@@ take completely new goals in the internet of things .
at the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstr@@ ating a safety researcher , how they could get connected with the net connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the heart of the winter , the Fre@@ el@@ ance of a der@@ art blocked heating so many victims can be worth a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators then instead of the heating in the future will block a whole factory street in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in Industry 4.0 .
one for all the cases .
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ load , but the HR @-@ V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , there is no spot in any place .
the materials of the inner room are well processed and are perfectly smooth , just the cockpit @-@ side falls there a little bit .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
it is not only a boot from 4@@ 53 l with high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l sitting down enclosed back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
that &apos;s less magical , as it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bank can be up as feature film bo@@ ilers and therefore offer storage space , which is up to a height of 1.@@ 24 m ( 1.@@ 24 ft . ) tall .
the trunk would be well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , his work should be qui@@ eter slightly qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is still another engine : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
steering is likely to be a little direct .
the facilities in the tested Top @-@ version &quot; Executive &quot; has no wishes to be desired .
the City emergency braking system is one of the City &apos;s emergency braking system ( works up@@ to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the track assistant .
the coll@@ ision warning lights sometimes irrit@@ ated , because he has rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ eto@@ ing object . &quot;
very reliable works for the remote light @-@ assistant .
and the smart speed regulator is respon@@ ds to the traffic identi@@ fier and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t at need the speed .
the full connectivity is available but only for the top @-@ quality : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI jack lie below the arm@@ rest and are therefore slightly in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are in order .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euros .
motors comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and single @-@ day car .
air@@ line is not responsible : down@@ fall on the passenger seat
an Air@@ line is not responsible for the fall of a passenger to the passenger j@@ etty .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argu@@ ed only with dangers , which are typical for air traffic .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up with the overthrow of a knee .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a common risk of life , such as judgment .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease fall : when pays the organis@@ er
fell ill after their trip only then money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests were reported to show the same symptoms .
in the hearing case a family was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting in the second day of their Turkish qu@@ ur@@ k .
it almost spent the entire holiday in the room .
their condition caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective small wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sal@@ tw@@ ater .
the family was the opinion , the trip was thus lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the wast@@ ew@@ ater was indeed defective .
but the organizers realized only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to go out that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the verdict .
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ urities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly bl@@ ur@@ red by cont@@ ag@@ ion , belong to the general living risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the crimes committed by refugees in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state has had to s@@ uns and decided to react to terror at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ r@@ ator with hatred and split .
we will not don@@ ate this triumph .
when offen@@ ders can leave the country faster , then the safety and strength will also be the approval of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals for the 2017 Bundestag election .
he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely in a medium @-@ class size of over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ y for terrorism must be under punishment again .
video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ce@@ ability was so amended , that above all the purchase of weapons on the Internet is frigh@@ tened .
the last much discussed sweat @-@ manic@@ ured doctors should remain ste@@ ady after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to seek solutions how the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said , with a view of psychological en@@ closures .
in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for needed .

for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to dep@@ loy investig@@ ators .
SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the certainty of increasing security . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly stated against action against action .
&quot; it was a tro@@ wel@@ ve for the Shar@@ pen@@ er in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , calls from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship was rejected .

better traffic flow on the highway wag@@ inger
there is a bit of reading on the road - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the legal scheme is to be extended .
this is a good news for all the car drivers who stand at the road traffic on the street , every evening in the St@@ au when they drive over the highway A@@ wes@@ ome ( A 43 ) .
the road works extends on next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Street exit the right lane to 700 meters .
drivers can then encounter right from the Hammer Straße directly .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , whereby the total outlet is improved on the much @-@ prop@@ elled section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the passenger train on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ ns the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ day the back@@ rest goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
the reason for this reason is the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic is only a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt almost three @-@ four@@ ths ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge has no longer necessary the necessary loading capacity to absorb the heavy heavy @-@ way forward .
as long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated stag@@ nant , the judicial operation may not say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official residual length up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ eg@@ o@@ esp@@ ur , the regional operation has been deliberately chosen for the training holidays because with disabilities .
traffic is passed on Tu@@ es@@ days and on Wednesday at the construction site .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the theatre play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a musical project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people to visit mig@@ rant and refugee grounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; The Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Young Theater in Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey , &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey has visited 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years the st@@ aging of the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee camp , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome categories as part of this project &apos;s cultural institutions in Münster .
most adolescents of the class have come from Afghanistan between September 2015 and March 2016 , amongst others , Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria with little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ograph@@ ies , the scenic images and video animations it would have been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .

rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather recovery
the weather has made the shooting gu@@ ck@@ les in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there are still hope .
the night was not suited for clouds and rain , the Himm@@ els@@ a spectac@@ le , said the chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday mor@@ nings .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather shall be good , then we &apos;ll see some shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are the Persian , the fastest planes of shooting at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names , because they are apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes right in the north east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one gets forever , while at night you wake up to sleep long before the wake @-@ up bells don &apos;t think to think of sleep .
that is all other than relaxing .
after all , it is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten per cent find their sleep frequently or continuously as relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there can be many different causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter Bill , the board member of the German Society for fl@@ acci@@ dental and sleep medicine .
but what you understand , however , the In@@ som@@ ite is , therefore , an in- and sle@@ epl@@ ess error .
as a short time , many people can sleep as an uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wagner is said to have a board member in the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medications .
insom@@ nia is an expression of another disease , not rare .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is common , especially with depression , &quot; says the process .
and it can be that various factors require each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and bl@@ ur@@ red about everyday problems and worry about , there is no example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , and is com@@ promised on day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es pain .
the rec@@ tification can look completely different : it is sm@@ itten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
to re@@ lie@@ ve the sleep problem , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy , or medication - classic sleeping @-@ tablets only occurs in exceptional circumstances and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
in Germany , there are hardly any sto@@ oping sleeping doctor in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ gri@@ ds , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Department of Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Berlin .
this is why you should first turn themselves in sleep problems at the dent@@ ist , advis@@ es the process .
this can clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was to take in the sleeping laboratory , and what is going on ?
to evaluate the sleeping laboratory in medical laboratory , for example , with respir@@ ation , in disease @-@ minded day @-@ fatigue , in sleep @-@ minded , or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ epl@@ et@@ ousness , be explained .
to prepare for the investigation , one does not have to prepare .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; please only make a lun@@ ch@@ n@@ ap , &quot; says fi@@ m@@ esh@@ es .
after the shortened , one walks into the bed at his normal time .
in addition to electro@@ des on the body you can carry nas@@ al s@@ ungl@@ asses , a chest strap and a anten@@ n@@ ae on your finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can people get involved in the handle ?
there are quite a lot of positions where you can rely on for a better sleep .
do not count on : regular sleep and rise @-@ times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch television to sleep , alcohol supp@@ le and watch out at night - then you start immediately to calculate , and that is quite and not eligible .
what the Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself for the disap@@ pointing dismant@@ ling of the DS@@ V team at Olympic Games .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler now compl@@ ain about his ex @-@ team @-@ mates by Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € rewards and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig 150.000 € , nobody should talk about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night on his Facebook page .
the feed system in the swimming sport is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good .
we cannot compete with countries that do not promote very much and do not see it precisely in d@@ oping the topic d@@ oping .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that these controls are set to be set , &quot; he explained further .
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler must already be reported nine months before his first start to the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : bonds of bags of luggage
professional slide at the airport Düsseldorf
on Thursday , the Bosnian Serb police fired the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several t@@ ash@@ - and carrier steels as a gang .
against 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport had a gang that was known to police officers from the past attempted theft .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ es since mid @-@ July and had a common , collabor@@ ative and particularly professional .
according to the specialists of the crime nov@@ iti@@ ate 34 , the Di@@ ving that had travelled for crimes committed by off@@ ences to Germany in order to prove four actions .
in total , they captured a total of over 15,000 Euros .
alt@@ ars , a few lin@@ den , in between still a remainder of the cob@@ ble@@ stone : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works at first sight not so , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous locations &quot; of the city .
you walk along the road from the east to the west , one comes on playing fields , a fresh@@ er nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
to the façade of a gray house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is also to be torn down soon , is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here .
articles about this trendy city district , &quot; how the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls may be illustrated by burning cars in the last few weeks .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was busy , the residents are occupied by rent , but on the ground floor , however , rooms are occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , since the beginning of the year , the police had repeatedly called for a tough occurr@@ ence of the police against the project , known as &quot; No @-@ go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers had been cleared , according to official statements about 30 to 40 officials and three team w@@ agon on site , locked down parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers met with the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer evening the road works peac@@ efully : parents go with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained in late @-@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the hood lies a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main majority of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the &quot; Kie@@ z , &quot; and J@@ ana * , who are moving forward here three children , especially from the police presence .
with the residents of the hood they share the care of increasing food and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it sounds not after a &quot; Kie@@ z , who wanted to investigate a majority police protection before v@@ and@@ ing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator , and the police open between owners and their neighbours , evi@@ dently not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter , which , in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk .
also houses and household projects are already part of the &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; : in 1990 numerous houses in the former East were occupied , including virtually the entire mother@@ land road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the main@@ board had been cleared in a proper street noise , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and were inhabited by the people today , who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become more increasingly to the mag@@ nets for tourists and bal@@ ancing liner from around the world : with these , people from East @-@ times and former domestic citizens share their &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them to the extracted discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were dropped with d@@ ots .
no other street was mentioned this year so often in words &quot; left @-@ sided violence . &quot;
a reason for that , not all neighbours who have considered a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body breach , statistics show up almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the crimes make property damage , ten@@ den@@ cial , re @-@ built new@@ builds and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94 , there cannot be no speech of un@@ certainty .
as for violence , it &apos;s principal : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , which certainly does not have been .
even the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rig@@ s no longer .
for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , live together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved to the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße .
this is why it was so important that the natives get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly inv@@ ades the interpretation of the districts in July .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to take away cap@@ tiv@@ ally : by spotted new@@ builds in the former bau@@ bles holding the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely ad@@ thei@@ sts . &quot;
but what should I do if somebody hears not ?
it places fru@@ stration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
there were little understanding for the tra@@ iled , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
whoever moves , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves in a ta@@ iled quarter , can be compl@@ ain about the noise of noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commissioned
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organ@@ izer .
besides , she is a social worker .
for July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the management team by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working together refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else besides .
Reg@@ ine Client from the Working Group indicates that the volunteer is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the jeal@@ ous wool mil@@ dew that has a problem .
thus , some - less mo@@ cking than the multitude of desired issues were under@@ min@@ ent - meant , when managing the position wanted to write .
searched for a management team with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long experience in the field of social work , a jeal@@ ous@@ y wo@@ ol@@ d@@ au .
however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ esty and full @-@ time players supported .
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection of refugees , which have been recognized .
for the connection of connection , the municipalities are in charge .
you must under@@ take refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for building , rent or renov@@ ations of these accommodation will need to carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ cill@@ or to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed as very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration has no private apartments .
it has not been functioning until now , to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communities must be used as beautiful as it is so beautiful .
so new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , there are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to solid capacity , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do @-@ profit labour - and well motivated , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes the work for the community to have a positive influence .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but it does not only mean work .
the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a condition of rig@@ orous feelings .
so there are offers of sports , contacts with loc@@ als and in particular language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so you can jump here as well as administration and volunteer community .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it takes time and might be able to rev@@ ise the time , for example with language courses .
who somehow did the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach and could not work , and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
however , there are problems , customers are honest , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer can always be motiv@@ ate to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth job . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; what a man@@ cher may call you . &quot; a risk of residual could not exclu@@ de her .
the hel@@ pers are sensitive .
these inci@@ dents are also the issue among refugees .
they were afraid that the ass@@ ail@@ ers bring them completely in ob@@ itu@@ tion .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would happ@@ ily stay in Ur@@ bach .
so Home and Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers need to look at the site and in the region after activities .
in doing so , they always have a new push for refugees and migrants coming to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
the policy is clear to answer this question .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on @-@ site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine Client also makes clear that the makers have already been utilized to integrate the previous people un@@ reasonable .
that are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one needs to help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : finding bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew for approximately one hour a different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are violent on Friday morning against 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi @-@ family home in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabit@@ ant surprised the two and struck the in@@ hol@@ lows into the escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters in size , probably m@@ asked , bore both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ses .

the res@@ oun@@ ding ran without success .
possibly the unknown were , in fact , close to the apartment , or with their escape .
