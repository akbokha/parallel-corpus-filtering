<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal TTP - both Clinton and Trump would like to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidential fighters are however unone in the tax and energy policy, as well as in principle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against such as the state of economy can damage - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton invites the economy to death and regulate, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast, he himself would be different, that Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will drive regulators massively, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to open, he has the advantaged chances of open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why tax would be increased to the rich, says she.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the needs, Trump and Clinton says almost no matter.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate holds the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and will be rejected by the nationalist Teaparty-Wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">On trump, there could be even partisan discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ump wants to build coal plants and drive the coal extraction in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in a protected areas, which he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton thus wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program, and calls for: "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transplantic trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both Americans want to isolate the United States by international trade but just want to protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are supposed to be paid better then, called Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars was a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase it to $15 a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question isn't quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he would not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to deflect the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him, so that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least of the wealthy wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every involatile woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who are alone, almost daily.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is only one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her small son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with great eyes in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starts with a table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">See Bahr by Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a division director of Condrobs, a carrier for social help in Bavaria, and deals with the topic women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are escaped.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodation for allanese women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs started up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>

<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are politically pursued because they threaten them torture or death, or because their families are sending them as a hope of hope in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">For women, other reasons for the run: "many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, honmorant, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the escape, this continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, the tug for a bottle of water require a sexual act is no rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that once they have anchor in Germany, consider, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here, women in refugee quotations are often regarded as minurous and abused in worst case.</seg>
<seg id="32">This causes some 90 percent of women who live in the property in the Munich city, traumatized, estimates them.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar, that they should say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the living, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often do not have to help, more accommodation requires only for them, for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they wasted from a similar project as in Munich in its responsibilities, some answers some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There are not something similar to governments in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Swabia, women are not separated from separated women, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press prediction of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In some common accommodations, both houses and houses in Upper Bavaria, in some common areas, there are only women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published for the committee, it says: "it is very important that men and women will be hosted separately." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated, it can come to - ongoing violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Especially the shower room should be separately accessible and accessible to women, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel of this protection need, you can read the visitor to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we talked about it has been around us, we have a long queue," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outside"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture which ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin made his Turkish opposite player in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot honour the impression that Ankara wants to write this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the blow, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was narrowly, and he was hardly an warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin, according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even further improvements.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan expected to have behaved so bad as would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm seemed to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a Putin desirable, sustainable cold weather showed that Russia's head of head had nothing forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather the cause of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in execution: the shooting down of a Russian struggle on Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was wrestrained.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to fell into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was even bigger, since it was committed by a real boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up again is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media led a sharp, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Once it seemed, the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations made from senior officials, that Earth's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamist state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He contested this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place just therefore, because Putin was given the apology to apologize, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind win.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed to get all the friends who can get, after the last month, in a failed Qatari coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count towards a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the national television grocery stores fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated this way: "tourists there long, tomatoes here."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious in the West, as it was thinking about trying to resolve the attempted takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the persisting Groll on the escalator of the EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is pivotal to withdraw from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the west.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, Russia's Russian President won a bonus for providing a bonus for the attempted coup d "état of support for the elected government's government.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow. it is self-understandable, that even has a profound fear of regimes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it once described me an analyst, "Alliance of outside side": two countries that stumble down from the West and feel badly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nonetheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still huge differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently released the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey were actively supporting against each other.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey gave it deliberately to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect Disaster, when NATO member Turkey gave the Russian fight jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders agree at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the Bank's Board of Management, RBS is currently being reduced to a back office roll.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bank has since distanced itself since they had to be abolished in eight years ago and had to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this time, brand name "RBS" have used to protect other final consumer brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the main headquarters and the stock market access will change to Natwest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other, smaller brands for the private banking sector that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB is become our investment brand as well as to the brand under which our staff will be busy as we now employ more to a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we are not a global goals, but pursue local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will no longer run his six Nations Sponsorship, and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop at the bank of brands, for how do we concentrate on inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Board of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these stamps again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a position of the Kremlin, it is that Putin, without stating reasons, has ordered his duties as Chairman of the President of the Russian President. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been an deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated in Tokyo's prestigious Moscow institution for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of the Kremlin (in Russian), that he was later head of the head and head of the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thanks for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of law, to support the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked his position to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made mysterious death in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time of the most engaging confidanese Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin that was aired on TV, both men said that Chief of Staff returned to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the consequence of a sort of power-fighting?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who once was praised as a potential president, once again became the Russian environmental policy - pushed into big skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin, who are quoted at the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said it is true that I had asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, I could say to me this very complex item - you almost say - complained about four years to trust.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it emerged, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Employment Service (FSB), he was appointed to KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that Ivanov could violate Putin's second term President of Russia, since a third term Putin would violate Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, near allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion costly project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north-deck of the Queensbury crossings with the viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four promises of the "Deckblower," which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, and 46 slackable parts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion costly project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister for Economic Affairs, Keith Brown pays a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment on the construction of the Queensbury crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering with a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the seal is between the viaduct and the bridge deck a delicate activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total of the bridge at their place and the last section of Decks get a betongation for the deck today, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first lock presents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure of cutting-looking flood and civil engineering is dar.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installation of the last street cover and its connection with the existing North-deck, we then had to close the existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling on the northern ascent bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons, and an ascent of about 3% had to be moved upwards.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green said: investors should be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "manual concept living" to the next ratchet.</seg>

<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A scheme is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD faction of Christoph Frmann said: "we are united with the Green Party: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments have to be found as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">But the cheap apartments can, however, can be found in the stock.</seg>

<seg id="12">A new townhouse building programme, which will cost millions of costs and will have to be financed, shall provide incentives for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, says Bratmann: "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to do more than a few regulations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left still wants to do hardness, for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, the Bratman, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept concept is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program does not yet fully understand: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compare the loss of another 1,300 inexpensive flats, whose support will be run out during the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the spokesperson on planing spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased pending bonds from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Furthermore, we have to have thought about to get apartments back into the price binding.</seg>

<seg id="30">Since then, the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, removed from the goal of the so-called flow-mixture.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating, to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are no longer going out to play outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with it on the screen, was used in the last decade of many complains.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Pokemon Go, people go to pick people from the sofa and be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was at the beginning of the TV, then video games and last for Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities are not exclude mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I take part of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were created first for the video games in the 1990s (later this produced a character series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sank in the interest of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been moved through massive demand, overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones on the outside and looking for Pokémons that are followed with a GPS, once they were found once, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "caught."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that recovers the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch that followed 35,000 users, announced that within two days after market launch of the game, the number of those followed people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data for increased performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public reconnaissance campaigns for health, people want to take part in a 30 minute time, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the significance of sport can not be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who are using regular sports, reduces his chances to fall into cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they are fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Consequently, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is mürcher game peroxide, which must always be complaining about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if using smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier we could follow up our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal, and the use will be reimbursed.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to poker achievements, however, there will be more games that will unite all apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present under the Frauenbalance in the gymnastics and that from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly, since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympiad and the USA were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, these team has three turrets, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewdin is and Madison Kocian, the catholics is, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has established the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport art.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one was one Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as she was unexpected, but masterful gyrochemicals.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold for women with a competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gym classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie defeated all the same way as Aly and Madison, to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will have four turkeys in the team. in addition, Marta Karolyi is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like it is a more expensive sport and Turner first line in private gym, which are maintained by parents, which are maintained for the training, setup, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their Turner and family).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these societies the Turner will receive its entire training and that is a very expensive and long term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both of her athletes since she started with the turnes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the congregations of Aun, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to provide a performance and easier access to gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gyms of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15.000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the young high-quality turkey, making the possibility of learning and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health, training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holder of the Olympic Team Championships and thank you so many young girls are motivated by a different background to start her way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a £2 per day, after recommended by the authorities to date more people for a longer period.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anti-inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collecting fetthalmic materials in the arterial walls that form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the Belag breaks it, it may cause blood clots to clogged blood flow until the heart and caused a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots solve, it can flow through the blood flow and clothe blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who had already had a heart attack, subject to higher risk to have a further risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unprobable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The design draft of NICE, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month period of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE health Technology Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people suffered a heart attack, a further heart attack, or a stroke, often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively shows further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand information options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of risk - is limited to a period of up to three years. the design draft recommends not a treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to circumnavigate with armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn off for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you withdraw from behind, you should then turn yourself as a first turning point, so that you can see your attackers and enter "from the Line" says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Seize the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with his knees to the vest and rotate, while attackers meet with pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run and move backward while they set the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, grab the weapon and rotate it, so the attackers cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lay it simultaneously the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his handle before they move backward and make the weapon for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see how it's Mizrachi Premakes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabt for a guide to travel his tongue in the dirty towns of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler subdued his immune system and theflex in a serious test - perched some of the soiling and most controversial locations in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and itator Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a Euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of any object, he used an Luminometer in order to show us what he will intervene.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed by the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising outcomes in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinse buttons of a pull-up toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with physicians and medical professionals to promote intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left behind, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by traveled across the world and ate such wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations up to rinse buttons of toilets, the task represented his immune system definitely underneath a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told me: "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughter water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was just a righteous man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proportions showed a luminous count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometres capacity is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to turn after their luminous count of 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have a weight of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel route "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterinumber of various locations like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says, "This comes the worst thing I smoked in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will find nothing here, because it is in the inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company features Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Vice President for Snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vujenmaa says: "we really wanted to have something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching, and at the same time the benefits of Probiotics explains.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstormings to us that we ended "Lass call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestine health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had done some of the things I have told him, like the Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian, to watch them and others, where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty leaks on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the validity of the survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said that they are using at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood that in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because they are not so far: summer holidays, heat and land for a bollern struggle - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, which are persuaded by the selective fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most holidaymakers in the country are on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not the locals but are not allowed to choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays we are helper to spread the posters, aerial balloons, flyers, and end voices, only effortless.</seg>
<seg id="9">As of September 4, 2016, the Election and last Feria, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is still a campaign for election campaign against people over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can tell, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition must fear his position.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">How strongly Neuling AfD cuts down and what remains open at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 as head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one looks at his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and chatting a little with the people, as it had already his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seering has gotten cold feet and gives Merkel the blame for the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your refugee policy, you "We're going" have accelerated the rise of populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top edge data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents; Merkel's German parliament is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as the Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since it was probably the majority of other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to hear emanating from other corners of Germany once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North East CDU was largely on the usual campaigns on market places and shopping centers with umbrellas and air ballons.</seg>
<seg id="24">That, then Kokert, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The union also noted that, on the country, you sneying the base that it must be very strict, again a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are on the left hand of the left, the SPD, and the Green Party: in the depths of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The council of the CDU elector coert to his mitigation is, however, self-debunting: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, any birthday party needs to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much on the game stands, Sellering has called for its SPD now to a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the polls, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD still gained 35.6 percent of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The greenery, small party, with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the jump into the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make up a modern virtue in the holidays of holidays and embarrassed on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online contest", "he calls the state chairman Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green chids apply to track search for local stimulants under the rest.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the peak candidature, just curd with a houseboat by the Mecklenburg Temple. it also finds it beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty."</seg>

<seg id="2">At speed, with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, begin at 5.30 o'clock in the morning and only at 20 o'clock, there is alluvial praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything fairly low," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay too.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be transferred to the South at weekends until the end of October, everything should be completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The decision is also praised for civil engineering, for example, when it comes to the establishment of self-processing drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the building site was carried out on Monday to the south and also the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rottenburg has also been placed, and the traffic situation is relaxed within the resort.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 again on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The downstream due to the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some significant complaints," says the Deputy director Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachristraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weighrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because there were many shades and were more intimate than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to them that manned trucks in living areas were franken.</seg>
<seg id="15">While the speed limiters were not adhered, the assembly demanded the vehicle from Mössing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant surcharges," says King, who made himself to be able to find out on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute drilled.</seg>
<seg id="18">The high speed was at 77 km / hour in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site is gone, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For businessmen at the B 27, it is only a little solace that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">People don't want to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 has undergone a renovation of net sales, each one asks.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have to do with the "Final Customers" has been produced less, so for other companies, for which the renovation hardly had consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "at most light decline," however, this also gives evidence that "the course of course is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">Most exploited are local spots along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, the owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existed already.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have taken it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">We were missing the clients from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales of revenue rose to "far more than 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">Road "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his collaborators have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt on a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise replied with the advice, the restaurant is profitioned by the advantages of the position on B. 27. now, they also have the disadvantages to surrender through the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where some more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family enterprise has been located since 1715, and refers to the history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars may now look less frequently because of the complex traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go up, it is also very nice too.</seg>
<seg id="42">At the end of restoration work again, Göhner has no doubt to come back.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner keeps the impact of the B 27 work on its customers for the greatest crisis, which has experienced its host in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Work: six months of construction, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the name of terror attacks on laws, the terror attacks is melted.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to recent proposals, the Interior Minister de Maizière is now a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a Dulce status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all that?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives a reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are politically reasonable, "says the Federal Minister of Agriculture in the presentation of his new security measures.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are calling for anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, further points would first be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also involved in part.</seg>
<seg id="10">But as the Minister of Interior, it was due to him and on a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Maizière was given a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, before he presented his conclusions about security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot is already known, announced, changed: that a new security agency is to take care of an encrypted communication, is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not the fact that Germany must translate several EU directives on air passenger data and arms correctly.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière is starting a second stop for suggestions that have not been to do with the SPD: he wants to unfold sympathy for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"that will be difficult points for the SPD," dream of the CDU man.</seg>
<seg id="18">He still keep this for reasonable and needs nothing, which has no chance for the coalment partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas presented de Maizière too.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: it plans rapid proceedings for shifts and more possibilities for detention from man before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should advance their smartphones and declare social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">While Duldings for the past asylum seekers, he wants to do some worse than so far - about those who take offences or reject their papers to swallow their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is politically and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">It also works even unbalanced and lets questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - at the imbalancing of ideas for example - the question arises: what does that actually do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be disfigured that the assailers were in Ansbach and Würzburg.</seg>
<seg id="28">Many people in view of the high number of refugees were concerned about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that cultivate men, let themselves also be excloned in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inner safety is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The safeguarding is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD remain increasingly on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">During the past days, it passed between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garrisky dispute over the outfitting of the federal police, then via a security policy collection of some uniforms of interior ministers, in which the resorchefs also demand a Burka ban and a turn from double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also labies with conciliatory sounds here.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't hold anything from a turn of the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We met the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">You agree, be not sensible.</seg>
<seg id="42">And on a Burka ban he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is unconstitutional by all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable," is only to show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">There is quite a bit there that could provide for dispute.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is currently trying to profiling an internal security subject.</seg>
<seg id="46">Party manager Sigmar Gabriel signalizes a full call for conversation and says: "the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to the certainty of increasing security."</seg>

<seg id="2">In spite of diesel models, the suppliers will increase worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">It does not run in all markets.</seg>

<seg id="5">Volkswagen launches his deliveries into the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Despite the diesel-affection due to its many brands and some good run markets, Europe's biggest car company can continue to show an increase in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July, the core brand was weaker, especially in Western Europe and loads the total sales, just as the company had taken away in Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">Worldwide, the brand was sold in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, the deliveries rose by almost one sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Head of sales Jürgen Stackmann brought back the weaker figures from July, mainly on two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition to some core markets, it has also been given a department store to some core markets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Besides the situation in Turkey about the coup attempt in Turkey, British vote have also affected the EU exit from the EU.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the first emission of emissions first escalated, there is also a minus of beech.</seg>
<seg id="15">Large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony will continue glimitously through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only an extradition treaty was only 0.9 percent to 3,37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group leader Fred Kappler could continue to show a sales splits from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">In this period, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide, 5.904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated using a software testing system.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, Volkswagen calls around 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of rearmament, Volkswagen reiterated that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the upgrade of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power.</seg>
<seg id="23">The coach station will inform the customer after the retrofitting a "guaranteed" certificate, but I do not speak of a "guarantee" as it was in operation on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The reason is legal qualities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee of equipped diesel models now.</seg>
<seg id="26">This was confirmed by VW-Representatives in the Federal Ministry of Finance last Monday.</seg>
<seg id="27">The report was confirmed that there was a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations are not accepted," declared Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has adopted the guarantee that in case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the upgrade no worsening takes place, and all type of relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "warranty" but not as it was in company backgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="32">For instance, in the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come in a workshop a half year after the retrofitting into a workshop - and that would result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">In addition to the customer interpretations, it is important to avoid that there is any other damage in some other damage, which is nothing to do with the abassin scandal caused to safeguard with any of the guarantee of any warranty.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, VW do not use the term "warranty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love slabs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you get to the commentary, in order to insure him under the pseudonym Non-AlleInspector's age with rough insults, this statement leads from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the most often represting of sound panels is not shown to boom in millennials, which would like to welcome the newness of physical objects, but due to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight, at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable casual group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbies: it has an emotional meaning: older panels keep their feelings rather (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a bustling road in Soho, a modest grey suit before I stand, my hands hold and try something like: "so, let's take a close look on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look on it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly gathering in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent salesmen were based - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand up in the immediate vicinity of several men in such stores, and try to study their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I spoke of Sister Ray (data: two young women, three men mean age) in the Reckless Records (data: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels.</seg>
<seg id="17">These panels, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records when they appeared and again buy objects that he sold, when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s that appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who buy records are rather introverted and are happy to spend some time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25 who works at Sister Ray, believe that many customers, which he meets with the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medienhy, people who have heard about the comeback and see again to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people are generally excused for their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to the record of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business just like Phonica, to realise that record transactions are a relaxing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted record covers, from objects which are happy and happy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions than a kind of solace," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collector so and I think it's so in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" soldered one employee of a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM had revealed in April that nearly 50% of the people who bought a record in the last month they haven't listened to.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% had a record players whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record is no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would look very worried while I flowered in a pile of Bossa Nova Kompilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men middle aged) has noticed a "trophy" of the Reviar.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only arrived here and said," I have no record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record top, so I can put them in the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musical-intensive.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which will start slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fenter, which has dedicated to the silverplate nearly a whole floor, has a blower audience when I am purposed.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists that make photos, teenagers and women aged middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beasts neurosophonic pop instead of experimental jazz drans from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but brand psychic traumas are hard-determined if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in the shop for a few minutes and viewed the varieteries for sale available.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is rather a shovel fool than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, so the collecting plates are not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a loved sighing.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit to courge the jeans-Hotpants, I watch a group of young teens who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of sheets of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them itself - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to receive them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry, and some customers can send in the depths of Sockos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also that one is most suitable for luxury objects like slabs.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research results showed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in Plo transactions in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record holder, which exist in reality, record shops, and online searches, not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security, not by rambling through record transactions of Berwick Street and the leaves, while they face an infinite, 30-year-old false host who rises above the shoulders of an older men's middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a trial hearing this week argued the authorities in Calais, that the government should carry out to sell 72 billion businesses within the camp goods, selling staple services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or easy meals for a couple of euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy, which would be paid no taxes, which can be paid by fire and risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that stores and restaurants are important since the free meals, which are offered by government supported association and other groups, not enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often have accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 Provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely imitable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than to feed people who live "in extremely predefined conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by defeating was the Jungle Book Kids's Café des Camp, which is generally owned and spent 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as an advice to asylum items for the hundreds of vulnerable people aged in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 in the Deacon Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji we scored a masterpiece in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line and roher force to win gold - its first Olympic Games of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was silenced by the not too bad trot of silver medal - Great Britain fourth in that day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day may fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in spite of this, I would have beaten a 15-man team in top shape.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not be - that at least a bridge will be a gold medal for his neck: Fijis Head of Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">She lost eight years ago with Ryan each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt you, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Fiji they were wonderfull and the attacks carried out by GBS out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., when you run in driving coaches. the World Series winners came from 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau went up in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he turned into.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are 12-0 and GB hard for the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A short Tackle Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain by man Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua placed a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-pfiff and there was still more than one minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valo Ravouvou prefied by further weak tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had been born to play 7, while UK still has to be learned.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time through and decided the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran out too long in favor of the South-consulate, whose fans sang, banners and danced at the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to see the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-pin with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fiff noff, the fijis impoverished and GB, crushing defeat in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past days, Fiji had defeated a semi-final match with 20-5 overlap and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Bok in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton interrupted the line with an impressive foot work and achieved a gate among the position in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside teams, assured the profit - and thereby the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning who inspires the fight with the cancer of the trainers</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no worse gold than playing with these games and that wants to hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 tough Hieve that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the rest, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the sportsman Robin Williams, was present at the second Olympic team in a row without tax concubine, the first women in the history of British Sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.s is unbeaten, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes that glides over the surface with the elegance of tails, what does not reflect the kind of triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the Rudern there is a battalion to consent, which make the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who would not survive the day 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do it, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could commence the interruption to a minimum, if that is the correct concept under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even greater.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of victory, their first thoughts arrived on Williams, who spent a nerve in the morning something more than else and thus trying to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who used as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan "said" I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much. "</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you on him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for coaching or have a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with whom their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get caught away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for doing something Tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take for a year before making decisions about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Bells must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventure of Steve Backreverb.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took approximately six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">Everything was so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - light view of the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The frozen and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of homes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, which threatened the industry from the wastewrom-funding are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It may remain in the liberation of renewable energies moving in the inventory of the so-called inherent energy production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Western German General Newspaper "(WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations last two years."</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission originally planned to initially establish steel manufacturers, which would use gases from the blast furnace for power generation to fund their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry had an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission to talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only if the generators in the steel works will be replaced, an EEG levy ratio of 20 percent must be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even these will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed the agreement in Germany with the EU Commission to its own generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus, the status quo of the previous rule is largely written.</seg>
<seg id="13">This particular importance has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in view of our campaign" steel is the future "that is the first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more needs to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann, stated in Frankfurt, are also weakened with the reform of emissions standards," said IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has since been suffering from overcapacity and substantial price pressures since the financial crisis 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation became worse than the world's largest producer of producing domestic demand in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw Chinese steel concerts Preisdumping ahead.</seg>
<seg id="20">During this spring of spring, the situation has a little relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, import tariffs on import-carbon effect, for others, economic prospects have emerged in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear, how sustainably the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry-primus ThyssenKrupp still was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last the prices have been stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also wanted to exclude individual works of single works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced less than six percent less steel than in the previous year, as the German-German economy hasted Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing senior citizens good</seg>
<seg id="2">The Singen has accompanied her life as her whole life: when a young girl was her in the school choir, she attended the subject of music, and the 78-year-old plays the 78-year-old in an elderly choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and lively, she tells her.</seg>
<seg id="5">Very next, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen, Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler, from the German senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with equities the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular meetings, seniors and social contacts can establish and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because there are often social and family structures in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience was made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to arrange and organise themselves on the other, and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cloning."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing, senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever calls on his lungs, is not so fast in everyday life as quickly as the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it's about to get the sound of the voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, Ursula Lenz stated by the unemployed community of the seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people are awakening, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, people are destructive to long-present events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a special performance is required by the Singen, says Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on his own voice and to a given rhythm, and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone, practice themselves, do not only concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one goes through singing in choir, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing together in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I have long for something, I'll get better and watch over me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, does not betray Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 sinful people who hears it when a tone does not go to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, senior citizens have various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone singing from the circle circle in a geriatenchor, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a clesiastical choir, can turn directly to the church or the church suburb.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior teachers are also found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you have no access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask help with the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should be connected to a choir, advises hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul good and liberating something - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="4">Thus, a disastrous Islamic faith, or from the Middle East, are diffamised in extremist way.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therefore we observe the movement as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "identity movement" is grouping with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns against "multiculti Wahn," "uncontrolled mass migration," and the "loss of own identity by overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional Protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the "identity."</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said, his authority has worked closely with the state offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'Identity movement' to pick up their target audience, where it stands," said the Constitutional Head.</seg>
<seg id="11">Generally, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Islamists, as well as legal extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is no questionable advertising for its own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are due in a special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, there were reports from several federal states on contacts of the "Identity" of AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Maate said, he did not have knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the constitutional protection, any possible contacts of this species is relevant until a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the party - in this case, the AfD - through certain people, the extremist, changes their target direction, and is so extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">So crucial, whether such people have contributed to the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the significant increase of legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maate, he would not speak of new sense of terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have found in recent years that it can give judicial structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There were the 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may definitely be that further legitimists of groups or small groups, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee storms or attacks from other right-extremist motives are planning.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, a German-wide or European controller of jurisdicrorism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were developed on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, they expressed that many convictions on the account of people went to appearance in the right scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">That's the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspicious attacks on asylum seekers were not known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or trailers of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have committed offences, who had previously agreed before with the right extremists who were perhaps politically indifferent, or for example CDU, SPD or left, who were then radicalised through the extremist mood."</seg>

<seg id="2">Upon the plant in Azendorf, the sewage costs will again be increased once again, if appropriate improvement should be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a vast calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the permission of the domestic product was established by Landscape and Kulmbach that for these sewage plants undergo underground.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the legal basis, the market Kasendorf is committed to operate the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, citizens and industrial companies from world leaders, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to lie lower in the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee-heights are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of Directors Herbert Schmidt on the panel, a re-stimulation of the fees for sewage systems was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, there are also over- and subcovers from the previous cold development period.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious brewing-cavities established Schmidt with it that there are relatively small sanitation systems in all three sewage plants with a very low wastewage decay ranging between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for performing repairs of several thousand euros would be engraved.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, the sewage wastes in all three plants slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to all three systems, due to their age of refurbishment and repair costs, in a considerable extent, please not last due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the feast, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that in the sewage plant Azendorf, the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">For almost 20 years old support plants had to be overhauled by the pump on the pump. after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be installed, the sewage sludge is disposed and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to keep the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "on these exceptional expenditures came to take into account the continued professional and maintenance costs which are to be considered in the new calendar period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 still clearly below the present level.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made clear that at low wastewage in the three facilities supplied the expenditure for the operation and maintenance. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Thus, Schmidt, the market leader of great entertainment costs in the sewage plants remained spared over the past 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by anime-inspired, but some observers tell that it is unsensibel compared to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it offers Snapchat about 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already ans absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform themselves into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unrefined, self-winding tools that generate more than 30 million improved selector per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All failure to get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat-filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app, Blackface encourages or white skin to become a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it struck a filter in some users this week, which gave them slotaught, false teeth and strandling cheeks, they called it some critics a racist cartoon by Asians - "smoothills."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked if these repetitive controversy raised to a larger problem, that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat claim that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered a apology: the filter was intended as a homage to Anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiveness, the racisranus, reminded the filter to violating clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others have decided the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American college student, whose tweets were widespread over the photos that the filter was injurious and mildly said unpleasant. "</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the return of a very resilient Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish-sighted, but that the yellow catching has been dragged in.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed this cultural Stolperdraz.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience for young people - who diversed in the race as their older opponent - might assume more of that sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of snapshots felt a picture is that for a user is offensive, it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was earlier, "said the 25-year old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided that she is working as a manager and engineer for her, her Snapchat account has called on to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an interview for Medium and in a phone interview, she said that her racial controversy reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the big part white, only male leaders and ended their essay using a hashtag: # DeluSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either do they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that are there, but not in positions, in which they are safe or feel comfortable to say what to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, that is mostly unanswered by the Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company releases no figures on the diversity of its employees and has its status as private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff, but according to a speech, the company has set up a personnel manager, which focuses on subvered populations and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu told her part that she will be closed her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military nationals of the United States Central Command post-Changed Information of the war against the so-called Islamist state in Iraq and Syria, as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site, listed in a report of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Advisory Council, Intelligence Committee and the Military Command, reported from great dissatisfaction under Central Command Secret Services which reported their assessment to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida that controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"news service information that were typically approved by high level CentCom commanders, regularly identified a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it was the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when bad analyses will be presented by our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">CentCom lead the lead to the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed residue problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it does not hesitate to change government pointed at Obama's instructions, it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their accusation, an optimistic image from the threat of the Islamic state, known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements made clearly more positive than the facts," said the report.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, CentCom was announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, second-second city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, much clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Kansas, Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of the year 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the subsequent report to record the danger due to ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in life after them knew that analysts are concerned about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, there are further investigations of CentCom reports by the general inspect of the Ministry of Defence in progress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own insights in Thursday that agreed with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 CentCom was created a full limited process for the creation of intelligence agencies to Isil and the Iraqi Security Services," gave the highest ranking Democrats in the Kommidee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, such as the ship, "delayed the publication of subsequent reports," the morality under analysts and "gave excessive space for softer opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said there were no evidence on the intervention of the White House in the CentCom analysts "regarding a" specific political opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations into the Pentagon's Administrator-inspect that were taken by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress while the investigations of the general meeting would still be in progress.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also believes that "experts sometimes quite denying opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues in the National Defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year, however, had dropped out of the question that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminders of disputes over the Islamic State of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom was questioned about how the former government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to suspend on the aftermath of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in revolt against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker announced the team at Mr. Hooker according to government points that, contrary to the government's declarations, there had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, because this provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this realization was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislatures because of its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into retirement and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US win four-fourth match in the field-hockey of women, a showdown with Britain before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won by 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be actually a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, this is what they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equalizing in its group with the British on the first place that remained undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will hit the first round on Saturday in the last game.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which each of the two teams will achieve the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">First placed, the strong Dutch will go slightly longer out of the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game is going out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host through their success story, four years after the last London Games took place on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in blue Bell, Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey club in their hands (their two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years ago she became a National player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as it did not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came in 2012, in which for her and her team, everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the National Team and began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"change of culture, mental change and physical change" said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work of work in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have embraced the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the game without victory, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the play from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game in her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">It carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and luded the ball into the US to make a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like bam.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the support of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro will feel stable and insofter, a shaving relay between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic Fackel himself is a burning staff, who served as a triathlon for triathletes on the athlete's triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors within the queue shop, without using Simone Biles, Katie Lecovering y or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have might be sent under these known names that were sent to Prime Time, even if it would be a swimmers, Turner or even fist.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting with gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized: airpistol chery, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may reign for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But when I should make a humble arguments for my particular darling, let me turn the attention to the discrete charm of the Trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the Trampolinskip had already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so meticulous that many those questioned, I didn't know that there is a Olympic port at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athlets to match it, it has never gained a medal in the trampolines and until 2012 he had an athlete who made it to the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to settle for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Trampolinel has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a little enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartoonous tremors of his never-ending graveyor - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two types that it essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, meaning as much means "jump board."</seg>
<seg id="22">Climbers jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (threaten, hammand saltos) before landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are assessed by the official Olympics program according to design, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, outward and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">It does not only hunt the finishing line or the initial wall, but in the TV coverage another highlight: the World or the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streak is nobel, admired, even fanatic, and it is enough to even touch a viewer's tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when looking at these games as a little tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she whispered, seemingly agulated like an astronaut, goes upward, then effortlessly to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here also here is a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves enter the distance, only the dreaming, elegant raising of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The trials and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also found at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC shows the encircles as part of a descendant bloc after two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that will probably be overseen in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the growth of consciousness can only be reached by the attack and object of male athletes - as it proposed the male US Turner at The Wall Street Journal, Dooley expects his home to the air, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation of protesters" in Ethiopia, long a consortium of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters prompting political changes in Ethiopia to strike violent opposition in the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses speak that three protesters were killed during clashes with the police in firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia tried to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid group of West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer to the government was indexed according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen trained to kill an armed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos relating to the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security merchants are hitting young people with impacts, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated to be west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services closely cooperate with the Ethiopians to fight terror via the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa if at all, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was everything as an example for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, but dissidents were put into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were taken into exile, or imprisoned in prison, or put them into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress the people and they don't have other options to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in the Ethiopian Ethiopian.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints, that cover everything from the land use to the litigation relating to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far reaching criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the Opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this cuddly, disputed line requested in June hundreds of life.</seg>
<seg id="28">The analysts agree that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which could be forced over the past few years, could recover the turbulence and could be armed again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of dying after years of rock should now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians were able to communicate via the social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more common and an Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has closed access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are in regular intervals, especially among protests, does, many people still communicate via Internet Proxies that hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave up that they were assembled to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since the branches, the Amharas, who come from branches of countries, are predominantly Christian high, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigers, accounting for around 6 per cent of the population, and those in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the disturbances is death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebellion leader, had died until his death on a non-public disease in 2012 for 17 years, Ethiopia's Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered tactic genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that it was particularly promising to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use Special Representative to process opponents, and to make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">According to the current regime, the current regime is lacking, Mr. Abdi said, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take the position of Mr. Meles in a relatively unclear reason.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mr. Meles, who came from the Tiger region of northern Ethiopia, comes to Mr. Hailemariam coming from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst tell that he is not the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear, that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced a proturmoil in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, according to the indications that had been expelled by the government and subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following raids were killed, many protesters were killed, even if there were fewer than in the last months, and at that time the disturbances went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts, Ethiopians leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty abatement.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this does not prevent the intensifying of internal abuse of the Ethiopian Government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month attacked protest in Gondar, an amharic town, of Tiger performed shops and hatred against the Tigers is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst tell that the protests in the US and other Western allies will bring in a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently announced that it closed the base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy in the West, he doesn't want to unite his ally in a volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had been founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy starting on Friday, that his multiple repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification cast new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans Presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow-strikers to take an effort into protection during an eventful phase of protection, in the specific position, which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the clarification on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the statement on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really does not intend to indicate that president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tweet was contrary to the previous day, Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he thought the excuse perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">As the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump wanted help to disclose the statement by telling him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican Presidential candidate wanted nothing to know.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leveled against Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct his campaign due to falling limits on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to the business situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and found that he had found her talk boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already taken sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved to strong criticism as he thought that the Russians were supposed to have been caught Mrs. Hahn's Emails, but he later told "Of course, I called the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then withdraw after demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test out how certain messages from his fans will come, as they arrive, and then they may define" clear "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his testimony enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defsharpened the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even corrosive tone since its values have gone back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was posted on Friday, showed a leader of a huge advantage in the North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally attempted to apologize for his provocative statements, he accused his critics, to misunderstand his testimony or to misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is intensified in the focus of attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal fellow-guns to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent intercession, was struggling to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani thus says to the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama had more than unknown, small organization before Obama named her backbenchers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved to Iraq troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most Mainstream Republicans are attempting to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, ISIS allowed themselves to spread themselves under control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, and designed them to ride on each of his words and to be pressurised against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor," "TV experts who try to understand him and said," You can't. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats scottle above Mr. Trumps apologize as only one more evidence that he was inappropriate for the Presidential Bureau.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once at the price of the market, café is coming back into Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a rundown café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi but for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of its Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie's business was replaced in the summer of 2014, sold soap in form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals there were as last loss in an genetically modified city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabaster wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is changing, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb now is a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York changes is change, it is also new.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Café opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepted cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the publisher is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to allocate funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment again.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu includes sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garages such as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is natural dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there is fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez told that he noticed a stoned stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on an Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after being moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way to himself.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the closing was closed, she gave her a while the coffee tines, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb who liked it," she said.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now they drink coffee again, even if they coffees at this day instead of their usual iced coffee, a blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a prolongtime and loyal customer since the start of the Verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went to work there, and he always questioned the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I came to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they prepare my Everything Bagel in butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today, Rosenthal will always get his usual order, but sometimes he changes his all-bath with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he did not make a groove on the fact that the soap business has taken the old business area.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie blown to create a special soap for verb with the coffee-brewed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go to their offer," Rodriguez.</seg>
<seg id="38">The café also accepts the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the bill into Polish and Rodriguez, that he presented them soon to make them feel welcome, so that his new neighbours feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice locally would like to fill the cold brewed coffee in bottles and sell.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring buildings.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground, when the café graduated.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that the rehearsal and the Order felt a new coffee like a homecoming.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took on his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt took a Faithful for refined delicatessen at Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on this day was a little modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with people," said Jane Aegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>

<seg id="9">Their latest cooperation, "a decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with one reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, schnapps snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the IPcrash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a cream cheese with olivets, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter had hended hackers, this found the pair for a discussion on the meal in the era of the Great Depression.</seg>

<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap, which stretches out the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts eat, that they serve as dinners.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been placed on the stomach as lead," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you can-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women collaborated for male subjects and it was served fresh baked patterned for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland's oldest cyclist is nearly 400 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight. more rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks are usually only available in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlanhaie got up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the Greenland-shark flocked along the bottom of the North Atlantic with an average of 1,220 meters in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only if it depends on it, the five meter long animal accelerates to a whopping 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Such a strong lifestyle, however, seems to be a formula for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate of Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," says Alexander Schornate from the Max Planck Institute for Demgraphic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">True, the Evolutionary biologist suspects long that Greenland's sharks become stonry.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, they are mainly living in the polar sea front of the sparsely populated coastal waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures of the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers want to know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her timelongempo shows her, when she was equipped with a transmitter in front of Svalbard for six animals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the jaw of a young ice-bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe she chase them sleeping animals or patroubles at the bottom of the ice cream and look at Kadaver who torates from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland's sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the biggest 502-cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the age of carbon in the sharks with the Carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens occurs already before the birth of the sharks, which the proteins contained therein will no longer be redone.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a remarkable Carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was therefore, therefore, after the early 1960s, when the nuclear araffinity attempts to get bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast, with 220 centimeters in length, the lens only contained a low excess of carbon-14 from nuclear arming, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland-sharks had a normal carbon-14 gas, due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14-Clock showed an age of 335 years at the age of 335, while the Rekord Hai with 502 sits even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that Greenland's shark females got offspring when they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length of the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters are probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age at 156 years have been determined, Greenland with the multiplication fall at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This may also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, an 211-year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpodge heel, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures, the body of the living animals often lives on savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume increases much faster than its surface, which the animal heat spreads.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of an elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">So a small animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it as if you have so much offspring as early as possible, "says the Evolutionary biologist.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should not invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The City of Main, in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies coming from London.</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most of the Brexit vote," Michael Voigsaw, Head of the Competence field Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether the funds will continue to operate from London financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU pass, the approval has been introduced to them in Britain.</seg>
<seg id="6">They are just big US banks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced to transfer jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobbyage "Frankfurt-Main Finance" anticipates 10,000 new jobs in the main course of five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), agree with responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as European insurance company EIOPA and ESRB.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered, but it is less important to the ECB's financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the proximity to banknote bank is important for banks since they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigmaster.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even in Luxembourg, a large fund industry, however, will cut away worse, just as Dublin for the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thanks to the big airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The city will also be easily available for commercial real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Paris, it is not that easy to find free-quality offices," says Voigroses.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition to the Seine, the rents for top-class commercial real estate can be 50 percent higher than on the Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition to Frankfurt, Frankfurt offer higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of corporate consulting firm Mercer spread the city to No.7, Dublin on No.33 and Paris at 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if the quality of life has a question of preferences, "with his already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market, Frankfurt could move further banks and investors," the IW.</seg>
<seg id="20">But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, despite the Brexit implications.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason the power relations work: in London, according to figures of Landesbank Helaba, in the end of 2015, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector, in Frankfurt there were 62,500.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the abolition of sanctions, according to Russian ambassador in Iran, Levin Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran on the year comparison rose by 70.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest in Russian companies grew sharply in the country, divided the ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies take existing connections with Iran, while new companies are ready to procure access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of course, further trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "said Dzhagaryan.</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran had risen by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, the Russian imports increased by 91.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trade swing was achieved through deliveries of machines, land vehicles and weapons, "said the ambassador.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, the Russian foreign offices gave roughly 35,000 Visas, primarily travel citizens, Iranian citizens.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor part that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made herself too hard. the Jinn and proudly introduces the legend when he stormed home, in order to visit a victory from the Favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England, four years ago, claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympian medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, having made it in March at the London World Championships in London despite the back of Hoys only a humble sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man who stayed with her when they saw potential in the shallots that unfolds now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindu, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy winner - and Skinner put an Olympic champion in qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindi returned to his lap, but Kenny carried the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy of strategy made a large proportion of transformation, in the execution in a higher speed to slow down and to slow down to slow down Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked out from his position as a BBC specialist and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up a Olympic champion in the final round and defeats the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just amazing.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Following the triumph of 2012 on the side's Kenny and Hoys, there was evidence that he fell down on the railway after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later, and there was no objection of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">During such an overlap victory there was no problem for this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hindes said, "It feels like all the UK flags on the tribune as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many global titles so that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is an barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expecting successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the Form Kenny it is in the realm of possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a sacred date for British sports; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy it for the moment."</seg>

<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels good to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be smitten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull be qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>

<seg id="42">Yesterday, he fought against the qualification before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the proper women's competition, the morning continued and ended, Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relied on its strong train team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played Dramas in the background, such as the resignation of the technical conductor Shane Sutton in April, in the heart of sexism and Mobbingbeaters, as well as the retired of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first night of the competition at the Velodrome, it looks very later than that now the legendary reputation GBS, which has reached its peak at a perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa finished the Point of Henry melting, which led to a clamping of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a clamping.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step deals with many years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melts with its Loy Yang A power plant in Lateral Valley, told that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in a majority owned by Alcoa and Alumina Joint Venture, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller parts.</seg>

<seg id="15">The contracts entered the deadline for 12 months so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the current supplier.</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong dates for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with that it had already written the value of contracts already in its net closing in the amount of $187 million, "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa told that the decision to book the contracts, the "Abdomas"... the melt of the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt "could not be affected.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang that would have entered into force of November this year, even if there is still an explanation, why it is signed from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn from the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consume some 900 megawatts of electricity annually.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the climateeeeee plot close to everyone's birthday party (Seacnant provided the sentence, "You did not believe that we have forgotten you?," with the honesty of an animation by 8 o'clock in the morning) but Kris had to take part in that publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of Vogue, we started a new era of the Kardashian era.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine than the "push-model" of its generation - under the former category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons, or reality stars or young people from today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women looking out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce appeared on the last cover had appeared with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of their career.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in time ludes: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The followers dominate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram, and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thick and bigger, it was therefore not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty big.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning, the built-in store was about eight megabyte of megabyte, that would be sufficient today for about two self-resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone has now been delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" arrived exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, to the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can buy the devices yet on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Internet-time of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the Cebit trade fair in Hanover as "office in the West-bottle format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent for that time standards: SMS and emails were sent and received, even by fax it was communicator to get communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible by HTML-browser when running slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and a electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could work similarly to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen found.</seg>
<seg id="18">Fairly proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price for one smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The mobile phone card of the Finns experienced an unprecedented surge, was eventually sold to Microsoft and sold.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market is well-known providers that came up all much later than Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow won't only bring in our local municipalities and throughout London, but to produce and prosperity throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me it was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was in 2012 in London, when we worked for a large effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be reached by creating new possibilities for local local companies and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we are already present 10,000 new jobs, create 40,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were preceded by us in London 2012, there will be such that would think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrow is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bluish ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The two-flaries had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overtake, but Heathrow responds to every question to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">As the Olympic Games is Heathrow for many and not for single infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, creating £211 billion to funny growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in order to leave the airport as well as in whole UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have been a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 bn more expensive infrastructure programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was built five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two frequented catwalks of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow is also one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to dominate this Olympic spirit and Heathrow and create our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and jobs, to be proud of England.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus had probably inhabitable the projections of a new NASA climate model probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms, which are similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus and its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once be identified.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, invent-like atmosphere and, nevertheless, slowly circulated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit up topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and shake off faster distorted.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow movement of Venus reached their day leg of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, to shelter the surface of a large part of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus that resembles evolution that had previously been acquired by planet research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly inhabitable, Venus -- over several billion years were exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans have evaporated and their steam-vapor was burned from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data can help the astronomers understand why stars are rotating at different rates, as well as the planet-time frames are used.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the comparing of our results with other stars, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio, the news spread about the positive sample at Danekowa, the 33-year-old himself went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," it was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>

<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes do not move the right shots," he said, "we have been under observation, so many have been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">So, for example, all weightlifter from the chronic dopinged nation could not participate in Rio.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of expressing malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in this way.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, partially multiple victims of attack with extorment software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies had already been the aim of a ranks of the ranks.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to use the solvents required by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of malwarebytes to attacks in company power plants.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially stress-money is considerably higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching rapid evolution of the damage software," Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski explained in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the extorment software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the destination, but the change to corporate attacking took place fast in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, they are looking for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Afterwards the software will present the demands of the extorists.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to obtain the final turnkey code, the victims must transfer the money - usually in the form of bitumen Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where at private use the personal photo database on the game stands, there are companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production will shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off when a Ransomite makes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had to undercut business activities completely, in case people were in danger of danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals in attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of nursing.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: don't pay, you only promote the problem," says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult, given by standstill in operation the demand of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the security researcher of F-Secure examined the user surface and contact with the contact pressure and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain their sacrifices by chat as they can pay per Bitcoin, set free support websites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be able to redeem payments from a few hundreds of euros, companies must share their share hard and five-digit sums to reverse their data undecrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potential high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomal extortion, the hacker is always professional and share the work, says safety experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus vendor SOPHOS: "a single person may write an Ransome of about within one week."</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overload, but the HR-V that has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, there is no spot in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the inner room are well processed and are perfectly smooth, just the cockpit-side falls there a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a boot from 453 l with high-quality and 1026 l sitting down enclosed back-rests, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">That's less magical, as it sounds: the seat surfaces of the backbank can be up as feature film boilers and therefore offer storage space, which is up to a height of 1.24 m (1.24 ft.) tall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk would be well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, his work should be quieter slightly quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is still another engine: a 1.5-l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">Steering is likely to be a little direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The facilities in the tested Top-version "Executive" has no wishes to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking system is one of the City's emergency braking system (works upto speed 32), the collision warning system and the track assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning lights sometimes irritated, because he has rated many obstacles as "heretoing object."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works for the remote light-assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart speed regulator is responds to the traffic identifier and drosselt at need the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available but only for the top-quality: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and a HDMI jack lie below the armrest and are therefore slightly incomprehensible.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets forever, while at night you wake up to sleep long before the wake-up bells don't think to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, it is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten per cent find their sleep frequently or continuously as relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many different causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Bill, the board member of the German Society for flaccidental and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But what you understand, however, the Insomite is, therefore, an in- and sleepless error.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a short time, many people can sleep as an unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagner is said to have a board member in the German house medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Insomnia is an expression of another disease, not rare.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common, especially with depression," says the process.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be bad, wakes up all two to three hours and blurred about everyday problems and worry about, there is no example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, and is compromised on day should go to the doctor, advises pain.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rectification can look completely different: it is smitten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep problem, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, or medication - classic sleeping-tablets only occurs in exceptional circumstances and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly any stooping sleeping doctor in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Figrids, Head of the Interdisciplinary Department of Medical Center of Charité University Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first turn themselves in sleep problems at the dentist, advises the process.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who was to take in the sleeping laboratory, and what is going on?</seg>
<seg id="26">To evaluate the sleeping laboratory in medical laboratory, for example, with respiration, in disease-minded day-fatigue, in sleep-minded, or if you do not find the cause of a sleepletousness, be explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">To prepare for the investigation, one does not have to prepare.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please only make a lunchnap," says fimeshes.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the shortened, one walks into the bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to electrodes on the body you can carry nasal sunglasses, a chest strap and a antennae on your finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get involved in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of positions where you can rely on for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Do not count on: regular sleep and rise-times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't watch television to sleep, alcohol supple and watch out at night - then you start immediately to calculate, and that is quite and not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altars, a few linden, in between still a remainder of the cobblestone: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight not so, but the police is one of the "dangerous locations" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">You walk along the road from the east to the west, one comes on playing fields, a fresher nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">To the façade of a gray house someone has "ugly!" sprayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which is also to be torn down soon, is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this trendy city district, "how the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls may be illustrated by burning cars in the last few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was busy, the residents are occupied by rent, but on the ground floor, however, rooms are occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, since the beginning of the year, the police had repeatedly called for a tough occurrence of the police against the project, known as "No-go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers had been cleared, according to official statements about 30 to 40 officials and three team wagon on site, locked down parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers were commissioned by the unknown owner owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers met with the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer evening the road works peacefully: parents go with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained in late-i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the hood lies a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main majority of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the "Kiez," and Jana *, who are moving forward here three children, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the hood they share the care of increasing food and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It sounds not after a "Kiez, who wanted to investigate a majority police protection before vanding left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Innensenator, and the police open between owners and their neighbours, evidently not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter, which, in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and household projects are already part of the "Kiez": in 1990 numerous houses in the former East were occupied, including virtually the entire motherland road close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainboard had been cleared in a proper street noise, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigs and were inhabited by the people today, who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become more increasingly to the magnets for tourists and balancing liner from around the world: with these, people from East-times and former domestic citizens share their "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them to the extracted discs or freshly painted facades, which were dropped with dots.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year so often in words "left-sided violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that, not all neighbours who have considered a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body breach, statistics show up almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the crimes make property damage, tendencial, re-built newbuilds and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94, there cannot be no speech of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it's principal: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, which certainly does not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rigs no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, live together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately moved to the Rigaer Straße.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that the natives get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly invades the interpretation of the districts in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to take away captivally: by spotted newbuilds in the former baubles holding the old residents.</seg>

<seg id="4">For July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioned for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the management team by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working together refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else besides.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Client from the Working Group indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the jealous wool mildew that has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, some - less mocking than the multitude of desired issues were underminent - meant, when managing the position wanted to write.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for a management team with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long experience in the field of social work, a jealousy wooldau.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent spot on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was highest time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honesty and full-time players supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection of refugees, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection of connection, the municipalities are in charge.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must undertake refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for building, rent or renovations of these accommodation will need to carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Councillor to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed as very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration has no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It has not been functioning until now, to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communities must be used as beautiful as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, there are Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to solid capacity, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants who need to be frozen or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do-profit labour - and well motivated, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work for the community to have a positive influence.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But it does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a condition of rigorous feelings.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers of sports, contacts with locals and in particular language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can jump here as well as administration and volunteer community.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it takes time and might be able to revise the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who somehow did the feeling, he could not help in Urbach and could not work, and be unprofitable, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">However, there are problems, customers are honest, "people, in which nothing goes." the work of Deuschle and Customer can always be motivate to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth job."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have been afraid of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer clearly, "what a mancher may call you." a risk of residual could not exclude her.</seg>
<seg id="50">The helpers are sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the issue among refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assailers bring them completely in obitution.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would happily stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So Home and Volunteers need to look at the site and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have a new push for refugees and migrants coming to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on-site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client also makes clear that the makers have already been utilized to integrate the previous people unreasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">That are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one needs to help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
