Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not really friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of international agreement as well as on Teheran to dest@@ abil@@ ise measures in the Middle East .
but there is also a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious since years .
Washington crit@@ ici@@ zes the constant settlement of Israel and is turning to the peace process in the peace process .
through Obama &apos;s deal to deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed .
in March , Netanyahu had held a conten@@ ti@@ ous speech at the invitation of the Republican Congress , which partly as affir@@ mation against Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting was rejected with regard to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his girl@@ friend shot shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon had said with a sc@@ ary voice of the police that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb &apos;s important to stress , that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably alive , and he said that the family cont@@ acted on the mobile woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , officials found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a hand @-@ written note that I wanted to reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was signed according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who set up in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already set up 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by police for the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Bl@@ am@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that at 10 : 18 University staff have heard the shooting .
he said that lamb had made the fatal emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police viol@@ ate him .
one day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ turers just forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to make a picture of what makes lamb motivated .
the details published by the commission on both ends of the state were published , as well as for what students and employees who knew him , helped me to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said they are looking forward to his teaching .
the police at G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ab@@ iss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record .
Schmidt himself mentioned the book in a written book from him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
they both worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations regarding problem@@ atic behavior .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ efs , praised the Lamb , said he seemed too little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to provide for health reasons and said that he had any problem for health .
this year he spent just two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university shows that the promotion , for the Lamb , had so hard working for him , would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Assistant Professor .
the German President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
those are questions that Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track later , when he arrived back in Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Bre@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in return .
it was not immediately clear why they went to this house , but Johnson said that it knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12,000 inhabitants , and he taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he earned his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 when they met together .
they and their friends were high school in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach you the guitar play .
he was then the s@@ warm of women .
all girls have melted where he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in Jackson &apos;s suburbs of Bran@@ don .
lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ites were apparently some time together .
in the emergency call he said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joining a ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
she and her mom were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb is interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ un@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met three years ago on a summer @-@ year @-@ old .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a faint lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he bore Lamb and Pr@@ ab@@ iss Night in the night September 5 for the last time , after the lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a lucky couple , &quot; he said .
we were there sitting down and j@@ itting together .
I mean they both had a good sense for jo@@ king .
Schmidt , the dead Professor , led the first semester of the seminar and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening around 900 people took part in the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the Church at a candle @-@ light commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial @-@ guard , while the For@@ war@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the course will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that lamb had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb had been written in his emergency Pr@@ un@@ iss as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two have been married .

Michael J. Fox is thinking about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were at the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it &apos;s becoming clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ aps and a arm length of it , with the princ@@ ess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ disputed the greatest time travel film that ever was filmed . &quot;
back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October .
UN CEO , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will save power and mis@@ ery to millions of people .
the UN leader calls on all parties again , including the allocated UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban on a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , on the edge of the general meeting of the Annual General Assembly , in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the att@@ itudes of the Council and the Syrian people and the Regional powers &quot; make this situation dis@@ soluble . &quot;

8 survey values , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is to take seriously .
some have attempted to turn him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
some of them are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how several rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper r@@ att@@ ach@@ ments to p@@ olls down , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some start to ask seriously what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that this is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ized that Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership in the rising of Herman Cain was in 2011 , of which no one won only a state in the nomin@@ ee process .
and there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election .
but outside the side groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps Power @-@ fortune and start to run their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey figures suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary stage :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy middle of June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
three out of ten say that they have a negative belief .
these figures are in the early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac voting in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump would have been nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , which would say the same over Tr@@ ump sum ) .
the next things in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio - with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republican voters say that they were &quot; uns@@ elling &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive declar@@ ations , 52 percent of those who have won the Republican voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul is the correct temper@@ ament for a president , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same figure is in the first voting state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his position , and almost six out of 10 independent policies that his temper@@ ament is not the White House p@@ asse , as ABC / post .
Republican voters reas@@ oned to the idea .
when setting up their money order , republi@@ can elec@@ tors hold real ump for real .
when they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , say after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump would be the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans , that Rick Per@@ ry win nom@@ ination would win with only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a multitude of GO@@ P @-@ voters turns out to take a look as plau@@ sible campaign .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still running almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fra@@ gment field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates diff@@ us .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump gave multiple support .
he made 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina in front of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally at margin Paul , John Kas@@ i and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who kills him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans , that they formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who are step@@ ping up , say that they have settled their voices .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ xes , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ ded with ump in the topic of immigration .
since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was named after two months of immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic extin@@ ction of tro@@ mp@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be re@@ mot@@ ely controlled by the Republican Party and will damage the re @-@ oriented effort .
but after the new ABC / Post survey , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ ded with ump in asking questions of immigration .
as long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump appears to do too .
the fru@@ stration about the government climbed to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of Republican voters meanwhile falls down , especially through its foreign se@@ ash@@ ers .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ sia survey by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines regi@@ sters / Bloomberg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago that three out of four I@@ owa ublic@@ ans have fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans at Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &apos; greater cel@@ and@@ ine . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in Hob@@ oo@@ king , there is the most expensive apartment @-@ residence - with views of the North Sea .
in the street there will cost one square meters of a street house with an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; in Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular areas will cost a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the price varies , however , like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has issued a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ er@@ ups in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several ten@@ ths of a thousand Euro nix - per square meter .
but good , who can afford that ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception here at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two double go@@ al@@ po@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller made the way to FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze presented a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; by FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ ean matches ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th strong success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to retri@@ eve the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ote to Munich on the third start .
Müller was awarded during his 28 matches in the Champions League to Bavaria leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who was going to pass one as a f@@ lange remembered the World Champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate that , &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , promised - and the Munich @-@ based word kept word .
they showed a concentrated , dedicated idea , without sh@@ re@@ ating .
Pi@@ raeus had the youngest six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , including against renowned clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
however , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , the country of Bavaria did not want to be the next sacrifice .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their adv@@ ent efforts but often to inv@@ ent works .
the attacks were often diver@@ ted by a bac@@ kl@@ ash on the steering position of Douglas Costa , which was seldom used against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made from the right , more fortunate than his flan@@ k from the right hemisphere in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion scored the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown , defeated the head of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct purchase , the keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern spread its usual game , Pi@@ raeus purchased a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ing .
to Tor@@ que Manuel New@@ man , however , was banned .
this way , when he direc@@ ts a shot of ide@@ ye via the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola ordered a qu@@ int@@ ette with David Al@@ aba on the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario i@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat outside .
the World Cup hero was given until after finishing the green light , he said : Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something else , that &apos;s already evil . &quot;
in the first altern@@ ation , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to wait against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the An@@ des Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
the Go@@ ddess arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ ond Müller another one .
in front of the game , it had come to the stadium in Kra@@ v@@ all .
after a smaller group of confin@@ ed Bayern @-@ fans in their spect@@ ator had apparently prov@@ oked the charm of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went up against the Munich supporters .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan were injured in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smo@@ kes , thus spar@@ es not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : with ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is reduced rapidly .
smoking has a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non smoking , smoking at the risk of losing their teeth at the same time , in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ feet higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental treatment are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum tissue , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the link between smoking and de@@ cel@@ ess is therefore back on frequent g@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in smokers .
if it is not clari@@ fied , smoking does not increase the risk of cav@@ ities .
people who stopped dying from smoking might reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endang@@ ering back to the level of non @-@ smoking , first @-@ aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich by the English University of Birmingham .
one should convince humans , non @-@ smokers , stated study guide H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking ob@@ struc@@ ts the lifetime . &quot;
smoking is good for lung and vessels , and leads to our knowledge as well as a good dental health to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth less affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided it .
previous studies have already noted that smoking rises the risk of early dental damage .
the new long @-@ term study is Moor@@ ish the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the Rhein@@ gau Rhein@@ u@@ fer rem@@ nants of the late ancient ancient
again , archaeological findings have been made at the right bank of the Rhine at the right bank .
in the proximity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , ar@@ che@@ ologists have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , Museum Manager Marcus Trier am on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the civil work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called &quot; floor monuments . &quot;
in all construc@@ ting buildings in Cologne , the museum will always be added as a specialist department for archaeological excav@@ ations .
in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the ar@@ che@@ ologists were now found .
text documents have already been known that , in the 4th century , a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained by Trier .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs , which was probably belonged to the Church .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the planned trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversial private sho@@ ot@@ ings for disp@@ utes between the series and states are therefore to be replaced by a transparent system which is clearly more traditional dishes in its function .
&quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizens , &quot; said S Malm@@ ström &apos;s Commissioner at Malm@@ ström &apos;s performance .
the Swe@@ d@@ din , to negoti@@ ate the proposal for a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German Government announced assistance .
the TT@@ IP is supposed to be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration proceedings specifically see that the EU states and the United States have shared independent judges as a new investment in the United States .
they are expected to come to the same parts from the EU , USA and third countries .
for the first time , there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to elev@@ ate against the jud@@ gements .
so far , the trial involved are linked to the refer@@ ee , a contradiction against their judgments .
in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizen of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström won .
in the long term , it aims to work according to an international investment court .
there , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ Sta@@ ats bit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) performed primarily by major concer@@ to ( IS@@ DS ) as one of the major reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ers are crit@@ ici@@ zed by opponents as a type of parallel . the tax@@ pay@@ ers are disp@@ uting between tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or cut down a drop of consumer and environmental standards .
in early reports , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations like Camp@@ act recorded the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate .
the crit@@ ici@@ zes for the non @-@ tra@@ ded free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) is crit@@ ici@@ zed .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mak@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great progress .
the Commission &apos;s involvement in the reform had taken significant points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring , with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ rators be taken from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Association Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against numerous new rules to restri@@ ct participation in the economy .
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses might be dis@@ advant@@ aged , and commanded .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreements can be concluded , continued un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investment protection has not been discussed with the United States .
originally you should have a frame for the agreement at the end of this year .
the date is not valid .
delicious Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
even 11 years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sat on the stage in Cologne &apos;s Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to it is a Fli@@ pchart , which is recorded on the shy of the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan where felt @-@ felt .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of various places he always records on the map , which he tells about his min@@ u@@ ously and delicate songs .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ ster &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s fre@@ t
since its vote Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is anticip@@ ating the tension of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour Chair , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will present his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and setting David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise shortly after getting the first of its six @-@ given questions , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour MPs out of the vicinity .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he can ski@@ p some sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , since she is elected member of the shadow of the shadow and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , in the meantime the Labour Party &apos;s decision was prov@@ oked in silence during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several cover pages about newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ pus &apos;s decision not to sing the national hy@@ mn has attracted attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had got &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Programme to sing the Labour Party to the national an@@ them , &quot; independent of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of the sha@@ dows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team and it appe@@ als to differences between the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party supported him as a leader .
the foreign correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be st@@ acked in the Labour Party and in favour of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to make Labour change to limit the whole idea of a limit .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labor and pensions , said the party &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government &apos;s plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , the David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , who has over the Dis@@ patch box over the last decade .
the Labour chairman , who promised another political leader , says he gave &quot; Crow@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions concerning Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas .
Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime time of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally being con@@ front@@ ative and that it is done in terms of &quot; impact strength &quot; and that it has been carried out on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the sha@@ dows of economic ministers will represent him when he is not participating - for example , when Mr. Cameron is abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally lay the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ man , the Speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s prime minister . however , a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
as they first aired on TV in 1990 , the questionnaire was recognized as the most important bar@@ omet@@ re of the judgment of a leader and his position under his parliamentary report , although critics have argu@@ ed that it had become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms .

increasing Po@@ unds will rise by accelerated growth growth in the United Kingdom
the pounds jump to data , which indicate a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the b@@ ot@@ s@@ target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings in the UK increased by 2.9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and sub@@ mer@@ ed assessment since 2009 at the time of an interest rate .
the Po@@ unds increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after the acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .

Peg@@ i@@ da poster brings the Lebanese man idea

both of them - and in the potato mus@@ k , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owner , Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together into a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a level at Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on TV .
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .

the idea of Lebanon has meanwhile picked up the action in Munich in the meantime .
in this case , according to the authority of the authority , she has recently been protected as utility models .

met@@ a Laun@@ ches Land @-@ Rem@@ uner@@ ation Camp@@ aign for elimination of aging
Met@@ cash is trying to protect IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ ers started a foundation campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a 700 million dollar invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia were prepared at the beginning of next year , strengthen both cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A through ma@@ instream marketing and marketing concerning the social media , as well as events like Adelaide Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as iron pilot Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ el , distributed in IG@@ A stores and sell shop owners who sell total tickets for the South Australian football League to loyal customers .
Met@@ z is expected to publish a further details of his defense strategy on 29 September when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices will carry out its annual investors strategy .
there is a lot on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia generate almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop @-@ stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ Network in eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial provincial and IG@@ A @-@ sole distributors have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to some 14 percent in Western Australia .
however , analysts believe , as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing actors , but mainly self @-@ assisted reta@@ iler sales .
according to a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley perceived that IG@@ A @-@ reta@@ iler could lose a $ 360 million sales per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA for the next year , bringing revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food@@ stuffs and grocery store and at the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed base costs could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ ers loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l of Roy Morgan revealed that IG@@ A @-@ purch@@ aser are the most likely .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce its market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , said on a business plan in Melbourne that Met@@ ers will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ ers will disappear .
Met@@ z refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member has made contact by Mr Dou@@ glass in recent week .
IG@@ As market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food retail , which has dropped by 43 percent , has fallen by 43 percent , which reflects the operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
however , whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers are v@@ ener@@ ated and invested more than $ 150 million to enhance sales prices using col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and IG@@ A @-@ individual tra@@ ders to improve their stores due to fast growing fresh foods and provide a better variety of private @-@ label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading r@@ ins@@ ets to Elan will become , hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis company Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ved more praise than cr@@ iti@@ que for his behavior .
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism of Australian tennis &apos;s President Steve He@@ aly rather praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , called again the &quot; Special KS &quot; , &quot; passed through the not@@ orious con@@ frontation from Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters over the lim@@ el@@ ight .
in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to be separated from the refer@@ ee that Harrison was calling for &apos; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to propose &apos; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA &quot; and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently saw how he crushed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kr@@ amp@@ f hit a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ icient in He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth to second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I am pretty inv@@ ari@@ ant is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little bit depri@@ ved of war , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration and I know Than@@ ks@@ ha@@ zi is good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he did extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so on and I think he deserves many recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he is exercising hard , he is well done in the changing area , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged based on his own ad@@ missions .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into consideration the decision to take into consideration the decision on Friday , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; than the right for everyone , but he backs up the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as long lasting strong component . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on the contest and not on all the contro@@ versy over around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick has made quite quick the rise of what people like spring and Murray is drawn , but we try to support him , but we try to give him the consequences of his trading , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency stand and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all who tried to come illegal in the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants acted in a Ni@@ em@@ ab@@ s@@ land and Serbian civil servants responded by indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled from violence were a@@ woke for an unknown time in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations grew .
as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &apos; opening the border ! &quot; and cried out more appe@@ als against the Hungarian war@@ ri@@ ot police .
some referred to protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants would be sent from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally damage .
in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries have to be held , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ences on Hungarian @-@ Serb border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the sw@@ apped Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU countries would record another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary still denied its hopes for an early stage of Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to conquer the crisis , so that they could accelerate the streets of separation and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country will also plane the construction of a bar@@ bed wire through his border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after the fence over the Serbian border ended .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in the past months , Hungary has become a large number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed , however , insi@@ sted that most of the incoming business refugees are searching for a better life , and not of war refugees , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which emerged at midnight in Hungary , cross the border or damage from the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Z@@ a@@ us to establish the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher pen@@ alties for the traff@@ ick@@ ers of human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government proclaimed the state of emergency , &quot; said government officials Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ers in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected to be expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press had already seen armed troops with vehicles and dogs on day@@ time .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that government had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already entered into the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are preparing to rapidly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a draw@@ bridge with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders .
chaos led the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and pushed forward a crowd in order to push there .
about 20 I managed to get caught , but thousands stayed outside .
a further group of migrants are blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would stay food and water until they are allowed to arrive in Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Bern@@ ie S@@ anders
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton still holds a two @-@ digit margin in the democratic races to nom@@ inate nomin@@ ating national level , but sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ another win over to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters among the elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is at the second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced he is for the Presi@@ dential Office , receives support of 15 percent of democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , the majority of democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion exists , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ics supporters are more resistant than the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups during S@@ anders several wins .
Clinton keeps a big lead in women and gem@@ s , but these jumps have decreased .
her support for the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders will only return with 5 points .
clin@@ cher &apos;s benefit with democratic voters under 50 years has vol@@ atile , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton however , Clinton had a big lead over the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin for the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders is now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the national elections are telling that they would support him with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support them with some reserved and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ ics &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are stronger in those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say this about their peak @-@ channel Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ ics supports supporters in an open question , is the most common response that it has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman &apos;s president ( 13 per cent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
from Clin@@ &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) .
approval to dealing with problems and voters are also quoted .
as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows an potential for the Presi@@ dential Office in the Wa@@ ist cup , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third has believed that he should not do it .
if a Democratic voters call for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
von Clin@@ ics &apos;s att@@ ach@@ ments say more than half that bi@@ den would be so different to their second choice .
decides to de@@ code bi@@ ds not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton increases his advantage against S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race for 30 points without him in the race .
thirty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; chosen &quot; has risen .
nonetheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call issues of voters .
similarly as last month , no single Democrats candidate or potential candidate for these voters emerged as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates produce good results in some important characteristics of the party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den than honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership .
for the three candidates , Bi@@ den takes the best from hon@@ esty , whereas Clin@@ ica &apos;s stren@@ ght is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not agree with it .
Democratic voters of the Presi@@ dential elections could see also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about one quarter of democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server during the term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinion has not influenced altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton became worse .
although Clinton is watched by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voting rights are not holding them for honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights are not f@@ rank and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush will be honoured with hon@@ esty .
a majority doesn &apos;t look different hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son there have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample division of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son rever@@ t at the national survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump ,
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two candidates , half of the support of elec@@ tors in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically .
Republican Member States continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate in the past month , by 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son comes well in demo@@ graphic groups and is more than ro@@ gue and republi@@ can elec@@ tors with university education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Cas@@ ich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest , and 10 % of assistance in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son gets to the p@@ olls - he lands on 19 % support among the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to the rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some page hi@@ fting up for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son decided to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps belief in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign scene in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured just in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water .
a bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a short while at a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more man@@ go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the north and Baltic sea this week , divi@@ ding the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
bathing temperatures remain in the Mediterranean Sea : even in the east , it gets up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees left , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student had passed during a ten@@ se rit@@ ual of a student body in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an@@ compl@@ ain will be filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an execution rit@@ ual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which led to his death , distributed the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and had repeatedly been attacked , while he tried to push over a frozen field onto a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about headache , and then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood call not the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ ing and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to send his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to collect advice , said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide and produced the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ mark Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with a bl@@ unter strength , causing injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the victims of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , an attor@@ ney at the D@@ eng@@ o family , in a statement .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by government is very important .
a County Grand Jury found an indictment of murder in third place for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with anti @-@ inflammatory attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ red its belonging to the town .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a interest rate comes , and the household is sl@@ ated in bed@@ time , rank for bonds , and the economy will lead into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long it will last and how long will it stop .
in particular , the economy offers only small manual for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve upon raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor here , as the economy and financial facilities react .
as a result , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphas@@ ized that investors should not concentrate on how it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could however notice that the whole f@@ uss was possibly ex@@ agger@@ ated because of interest income .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is being interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , has been told by customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal levels , but still at low level to lead to the seis@@ mic shock , which seem to be afraid .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a preview of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the market last month , advertising revenues can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ l .
once the rising happens , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal conditions after 500 days , with an average return on previous six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief device @-@ strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will occur later on the base cycle , and the return on the margin starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest income increases they often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed face out with some conditions that could not put it before and could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of its lowest point at a rate hike in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest income increases by 118 percent since 1950 only the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to information from Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rate in such frag@@ ile economic setting might be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants were taken to a interest in interest by the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the Federal Open Market Committee , which ended on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could prove an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade is only one lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the number of enhanc@@ ements from 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle of increasing moment@@ um at GDP and placed on before rec@@ essi@@ on@@ c@@ ists very quickly after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle was by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market is rising by interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds in bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in lowering in the cycle .
at the end of the rental cycle , lawyers arrive immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ stream of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st said in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
it is interesting that Jones writes that the markets have already adapted itself to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the view of higher monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , the ten@@ sion@@ ing has increased , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole , businesses that un@@ bund@@ le the greater part of their business activity in the USA are benef@@ iting , when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts are worse still , as a rise of dollars makes their products on the global market more expensive and equally the financing of their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ analysts in a report for the customers .
with a strong balance sheet , companies with a weak account for each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 was sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital contributions as well as low vol@@ atility of their shares also sur@@ passed their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers may also benefit from increasing dollars outside the consumer play .
savings might see gains by higher income , even if experts are different opinion , how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliamentary member Andrew B@@ ingham
the parliament &apos;s Conserv@@ atives crit@@ ici@@ zed the transmitter because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he would not be increasingly different from commercial rival .
he was also referring to the BBC Music Awards and said that she only cited The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dami@@ en Collins the program The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts to &quot; Classic FM , &quot; says a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something which does not do the priv@@ ilege .
the con@@ doms of Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster radio station &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ates &quot; and increasingly not be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; dam@@ aging &quot; - but it seems to make classic FM converted , &quot; he said .
he was also aimed at BBC Music Awards , starting in December .
the BBC Music Awards , starting in the past year , seems to be the Br@@ its just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ aneously named examples , in which you actually only know what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director proved the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from radio 3 , I &apos;ll learn about classical music nowhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works , I think also really important , &quot; he said .
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tough@@ er to engage , as it did in the past , as it did in the past because the British are less about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element in BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for selecting Culture , Media and Sport came under fire to enter the commercial rival to the bases .
the T@@ ory of Dami@@ en Collins The Voice of the BBC - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge &quot; produced on a special BBC fashion . &quot;
he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a entertainment series .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of other rows of The Voice in the future , or give money of the applicant to be spending other entertainment formats .
Internet sales grew in August at the slow@@ est , and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones to the shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday received the issues in November
for more than a decade , the virtual shopping bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned their home cities .
however , experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales complex to the Guardian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black Friday phenomenon , which was imported from the United States , is being cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that purch@@ aser will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on Friday , November last Friday .
last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers had sli@@ pped .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer could stick for sn@@ u@@ pp@@ ets , buyers could take away from purch@@ aser .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 £ .
in some products such as TV and washers , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out on web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people purchases clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner @-@ towns .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Br@@ its become increasingly art@@ is@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe made an increase behind him
this leads to a fact that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q net sales are close nationwide
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favor of the use of qualified @-@ European handic@@ ra@@ fts , which perform work in their home

women play a big role in decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also fought your top team in order to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .

Sports officials had only reck@@ oned off @-@ allowance and the sports club , which they had held from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , liabilities amounted to approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euros ) in the year 2001 .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we carry the club further or un@@ lock ourselves ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial officer .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , our life insur@@ ances as security in the Bank , &quot; he said during the arrest .
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there are only no debt to be made .
Fu@@ thermore was - in accordance with the financial support , the withdrawal of the allowance was retro@@ spec@@ tively developed until 1991 .
therefore I have taken part of the recording costs only years later , namely as a plus on the account has been paid out .
thus the ex @-@ form@@ - and non @-@ det@@ on@@ ations appeared , the former Ob@@ mann disc@@ usses the processes .
the def@@ endants and Spar@@ k@@ aries administered jointly , the second accused began .
why the withdrawal of the association were not detailed in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not interested in detail for financial ar@@ ming , that is important to only have the debt clearance , the answer .
in 2011 , when investig@@ ational investigations began in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the United Nations .
that had been retro@@ sp@@ ect , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent did not know an answer .
then he thought , he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have played something from that money , the prosecutor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , just@@ ify the function .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; compens@@ atory rever@@ ence . &quot;
why do lit@@ igation ? , we wanted to know judge and attor@@ ney .
upon it the first def@@ endant pleaded , that he had not been understood with this formulation because it had never been caused by the association .
but what shall I do if the lawyer said , &quot; You are all out of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; I am a representative for me ? &quot; he asked .
moreover , the func@@ tionary he has said that he has never taken a cent of content , he reck@@ ons only kilometres of money and di@@ ets .
as a di@@ ets he was charged with the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , added .
exact documents for the early years could not indic@@ t the accused .
these were , according to an operational test , in which everything has been evaluated correctly , no longer kept , declared them .
the second accused was also included .
all cultiv@@ ations are made in cash , in addition , he has to go to the Bank from his home to the Bank of Rem@@ burg , in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard adds more 30,000 jobs

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) does not end the pitch of the manufacturer .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut the reduction of 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
this means the costs in the amount of US $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion Euros ) will be granted by the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around € 2.7 billion , which will fall on the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years is not yet completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had about 30,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 .

time of decision on interest rates for US bank@@ note bank
the world is watched when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday that comes together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who have been questioned by Reuters said that a little more than half , which was still last week of view that the F@@ ed will do this now , now that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est lowered to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head associate at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed can not ignore the less ro@@ ar views of global relationships .
it warned the markets to move on an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are good against such a step .
the decision will be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
death cover at Delta State University , left un@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zing
after the shooting and killing of his girl@@ friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he subsequently killed his colleague and killed , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say &quot; I do &quot; with the first murder , &quot; he could make it un@@ seen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the c@@ auti@@ er police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , ph@@ oned the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning .
and said he shot on someone , and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency department , that the police had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening . &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house but he could not distur@@ b , but it will probably be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted it to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a Professor of History , killing before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police murdered him .
the German President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
in spite of the reports on Monday that lamb had supposedly believed that Pr@@ un@@ certainly had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence , &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said it had been married about seven years , was described as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ un@@ ites had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ iss her daughter &quot; were absolute best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss work online from home , from the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ab@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that she had a dog named Light@@ ning , who hit a lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
the police said that Lamb had ph@@ oned up at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; he is not in prison . &quot;
when police dropped him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later , he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran in the woods and killing herself with a shot .
Lamb received a PhD in the University of Delta State University in spring 2015 , how his life is based on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ ros@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group

Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper Eu@@ ros@@ ings .
the establishment of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and reduction syn@@ ergi@@ es , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not provide a executive board for passenger transport in the future .
the low cost airline Eu@@ ros@@ ings should be as pec@@ uli@@ ar as possible .
in future , the Executive Board led by chief Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r to be responsible for Eu@@ ros@@ ings for the future .
with the re@@ design , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet .
until now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
under the name of the Passage Air@@ line Group , airline lost three quarters of 2012 annual revenue of € 30 billion .

for Luke Shaw , Manchester United , you couldn &apos;t play for months of double fac@@ tions
at the Champions @-@ League @-@ defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven , the Double Fra@@ ktur of his Right B@@ one .
while keeping the left def@@ ending relief to the left and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal saw the hope that Shaw is playing again in this season .
the injury was caused by a promising attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year @-@ old Shaw was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field , and needed oxygen before it was brought to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg infrastructure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe a day later , and operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the cabin , he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fac@@ cture , it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red map and a displacement of a mo@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ se the Mexican .
van G@@ aal suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had in@@ fi@@ ref@@ ed .
you can judge for yourself , if I say there was a penalty and a red card .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account reads : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back on again . &quot;
referred to as : Manchester United had the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at PS@@ V
the European champion in France has an additional incenti@@ ve for the European Championship to recover from the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a mis@@ lead when Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as Holland @-@ crew at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; it &apos;s very hard because it &apos;s not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ o .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who had been travelling to another direction , so it looked at as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I feel so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was captured in hospital after a cr@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents may learn soon : if your child loves a book it will not last long until you know it almost .
unless David Cameron are like , they are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided that the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to have a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except for the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead of giving a summary of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air a commodity , hopes to see her desire to see a real tree , meets her desire to see a real tree , his real name was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name is Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , who died in 1991 but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron is in part , like the summary of the Lord Movie Database , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , hopes that a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is preten@@ ding to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron gets the action of the book so little . here , a dis@@ named boy , like the local environment , fal@@ seh@@ ood , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , cordless nature , &quot; that speaks on the name of trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to an assistant who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text was probably made by the Cam@@ er@@ ons election agency .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there was no other direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
to rep@@ el Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one has selected the Ka@@ der , the UK for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my map .
I would not ex@@ ert a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ ing , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear a you@@ tube of 2012 , but only a you@@ thful @-@ positive approach .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali has developed as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even when he represents an unknown at the test level , an option for the attack .
the news : Adam Ly@@ th emerg@@ es from the England Test Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , to analyse as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks using difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that thr@@ ck@@ et@@ ers are looking at results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ee , as - and I said this to them - players are their own best choosing .
a long time ago , it had been extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny .
he hopefully sm@@ ashed another shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not have such good performances , and this is not surprising me ; he is a team man .
the question , how much time a Test @-@ Schlag@@ mann receives , to set his character is difficult .
he received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him , while Nick Comp@@ ton came on nine .
only Comp@@ ton was getting the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that you could rise was that England , when he set down Jonathan in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in maximum shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer who I appreciate high .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ Player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as the ones before him , but this depends of course from the competitive position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make Mo@@ as next to Cook , bring an extra spin @-@ spin , and receive four qu@@ icks , I di@@ pped , and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz can &apos;t beat there , and that left handed left has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een has maybe done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he does not have a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first dro@@ pping before he appeared as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ inst@@ ants immediately , and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is coming in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited way of dealing with him he impressed me as a young man .
people possibly can see his statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup co@@ ach@@ ers who rise their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen a youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart ad@@ ditions to train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ate , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the tests could be a master coup .
he is one of the most kin@@ dest guy of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played among all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and powerful action into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind into the dressing cabin , even if the messages appear in line with before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the one @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coding and team @-@ makers don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken in a light heart .
the Bre@@ xit @-@ camps ( Bre@@ xit = Great Britain out of the EU ) could possibly rely on Zul@@ u when the economy is moving into a raft unit by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ issued new non @-@ negoti@@ ate strategy to keep great Britain in the EU , even without the choice of gen@@ ious Jerem@@ y , &quot; It is Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who suffered viol@@ ently for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel colors .
a European diplom@@ acy said neu@@ tering that some member states are so deeply con@@ cre@@ ted in various crises such as the EU is now and not always drawn from their own fault , Britain himself , and dis@@ rupted the changes that they are usually not wanting to be satisfied .
in Brighton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like this to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers report on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photograph of oneself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wants to leave Britain within the inside of the EU &apos;s Zel@@ tes - &quot; Leave us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ short ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s auti@@ ous pul@@ pit Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been on power for 10 years before it looks bad for them as it looks terrible for it as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a b@@ ass@@ ent force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist state government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they are to pull out a leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Br@@ its , whose energy should be better to prevent from the UK , Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most of them have separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies .
hence , some such ministers might even stand down un@@ helpful notes , throughout the SN@@ P style , while UK &apos;s speech campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , I susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was &quot; Ple@@ a &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how rough the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press file , as did not have been supported by our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can recall that they may be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who set up a name as &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his los@@ ers , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
as part of this , the med@@ ley of steering wheel ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ countries have belonged to most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir was similar to her , but noted that if one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas in order to handle it , rather than for lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ iri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed the report on the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was turned down by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door .
the press never bo@@ red him too .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to spend more for me - seems to be repeated in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott , Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ pus &apos;s official position to Europe is - I &apos;ll press it a kind - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wild batt@@ ali@@ es of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and TV this week said that after the boy@@ sc@@ outs I had strug@@ gled to admit that Cor@@ pus &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor was a poor idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father worked on TV about his endeav@@ or to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight , to stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said about what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said about what J@@ C told his fellow men and MPs to all reports on Monday evening at Monday evening .
whatever the touching picture @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to im@@ press - think that he even has touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the stru@@ del der Social Media , a breeding area of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct , Cameron doesn &apos;t give free ticket to Europe who allowed him to keep lab@@ ours in the public@@ ity campaign for granted suicide like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are basic @-@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past , and not only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion on the left @-@ hand dis@@ sidents who is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .

experts critic@@ ise report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful to smoking in a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the use of e @-@ cigarettes in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; extensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the power handling of the data and referred to connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate basis , &quot; at which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the asser@@ tions are based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health Medicine , School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multiple criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various Nik@@ ot@@ ine @-@ related products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was to have received by British American Tob@@ acco Safety ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also taught the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants declared to receive funds from an E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but these are several well known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco pipeline also took part in the meeting .
the research work of the group &quot; ad@@ mits &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; heavy evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , there will be no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of P@@ he that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being studied at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acted at the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful to smoking . &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong man dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are small but that we continue to study long @-@ term imp@@ lications .
P@@ he has given the clear obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what evidence is evidence and what does not , especially if there are so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die each year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion a year .
due to the clear evidence of recent evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC was going to stop East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chair@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give its right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting service should only be used to make the type of programs sent not by other UK broad@@ caster .
he critic@@ ised the BBC to place it publicly @-@ legal programs , which probably will be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rival and Sen@@ ators like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years at Channel 4 without success , to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on order or send it clearly by not subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications committee in the framework of his research on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I think medium or long @-@ term do not hold for a good idea , one should not do his production at least on programs that others do not do or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a great support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show it , is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression tax rate is financed , which may also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a programme , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both of both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I would have to see how this must be publicly @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s blame on the hunt is &quot; due to the amb@@ itions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programs of the BBC will give you again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture at Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that they could not measure the public legal niche programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the public , but they can accomplish their tasks , and they may be argu@@ ed when they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ oring programs , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ oring schemes that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a window window , in which no one wanted to see them ever .
regarding the broadcasting service , Johnson said the scra@@ p : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , all of you think we all think that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who &apos;s £ 150 a lot of money , wonder whether this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ light and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday asked that the BBC will examine their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , only a little bit from the BBC production would now officially be classified as education , he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and they should take part in the public broad@@ cast@@ ic television channels in Australia and Canada , to inform you and maintain . &quot;
at the issue of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein said , the BBC was supposed to do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels of Alli@@ ances , to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control bra@@ ins by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by hat@@ ches of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they have sound impul@@ ses that have too high frequencies for human hearing , to be heard .
impul@@ ses are working in m@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultr@@ asonic shafts .
more to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the worms demonstrated the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ Genetics , used by ultr@@ asound to activate a number of bra@@ ins , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain @-@ stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asive technique that ab@@ uses electric pul@@ ses into the brain of treating symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms react not on ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic shafts effect on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and in the membran@@ es of some of the th@@ oph@@ ones .
the sound waves have the opening of these ion@@ als channels and activ@@ ating the cells they are assigned , thus a report of Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani is genetically modified the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ship TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels are carrying .
when he turns ultr@@ asound on the changed cre@@ t@@ es , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bub@@ bles and transferred to the worms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ ists .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows researchers to re@@ lie@@ ve the neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be lowered to your desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound tissue can be hin@@ dered and can be sent into the brain on the sk@@ ul@@ ls above .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily imp@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ated human neur@@ ons temporarily for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are shown on bus stations and to the subway trains , which require a second glance .
&quot; important announcement : take you from 15 to 18 September with the D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) are reads in the font types of the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the D@@ LR line which conver@@ ts to a p@@ anz@@ ers .

the 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cru@@ el@@ ly designs in Ban@@ ks &apos;s Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution of London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack Packs , &quot; a 6 £ -@@ pack of In@@ bus@@ h@@ key , of which claims &quot; access to around one @-@ third of bus stops on the planet . &quot;

many artists are dealing with activists within protest movements at work and notice that they have to go out into the real world , so that their art had an influence on society .

Am@@ nesty International has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the V@@ C@@ CP advertising agency , the non @-@ profit organisation with the graphic designer and Vo@@ ice@@ over artist who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt Le@@ ver was astonished about the silence that prevailed about the advertising for the weapons fair - through an empt@@ ying of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic company head@@ board , but &quot; it is stronger with bright colours and animation . &quot;
&quot; they made a fantastic job as they help us to shar@@ pen@@ se the awareness of illegal torture on the trade fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es by Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is a adv@@ ancing of the British government and the guarantee that fol@@ ter@@ ers are not illegal in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the fen@@ cing fair dates from the range within Excel , where exhibitors w@@ aken fantastic products .

eight golden rules for life in student halls
eleven years ago I took as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year student in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ale re@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the enth@@ used smile of those who have prevailed - and on the numerous , long @-@ part complaints about others .
most of all I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the adv@@ ent in student halls ranges from easily ner@@ ves to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk about : people tell whence you get there and where you are from the Sabbath year , where you are speaking with regards to Cor@@ pus when you say &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those who would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were killed in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverage recipes , film night event venues and municipal coun@@ cils , but they are also places where people are tigh@@ tened and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not think about the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted a rough handling of the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room B@@ umm@@ el culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to li@@ fel@@ ong friendship .
this may be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away so I have consumed the energy , which I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ ant of soci@@ alizing is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of a kno@@ cking .
speaking of ank@@ ers : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that an un@@ sealed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
bound up with baking .
as you begin at the university at the high point of the Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of man to imagine is less strange than the welcome from the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have baked you something . so , now please smile if I ask you a couple of personal questions . &quot;
offer tasty treats to offer is a good way to close friends .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain themselves and are perhaps to associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , it depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep even when you bet .
steal food is an acc@@ ust@@ omed crime in student halls .
of course the cro@@ issants is a theft , but it is it taking a drop in sp@@ ouse for your tea too ?
check it with the dairy owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if cooking in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to cope with it as my co @-@ dw@@ eller who added their milk giving a deter@@ mind , to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
you should make no noise , that keeps people from sleep , or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the saying we belong to the people who sit in glass .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , if there is something to make them , drum &amp; bass roll a little qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even loud music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours therefore had to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and set off to her three @-@ hour exam .
would it be no romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would be random@@ ly into the same student residence ?
the other way , it would not p@@ im@@ pose it , if you have a fellow student for your future wife , to get rid of them , and then you will have to see each day and perhaps learning how they move up all common friends ?
of course the heart goes about his own ways - but if a hot co @-@ residence definitely isn &apos;t up to your future sp@@ iny , try at least to utter a little reason .
in the exciting moment that you notice that someone can lie his key in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a ultra@@ violet and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine than it seems .
a good stre@@ ak is funny , but it only takes moments , until it becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
please tell by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never swe@@ ep yourself any room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and place their keys into a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but throw their poss@@ essions in the ceiling no longer than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , All S@@ ans , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ ers
the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner is building in central @-@ fr@@ o terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
thus , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only attractive mother and the operator . &quot;
&apos;@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the domestic market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes how much cheaper living room can be created : it builds in one project in terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the home market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass@@ aging accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people remain in a big part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need enough space within the next couple of decades .
a completely ban@@ ish , three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a dog house needs the least space .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
that is different , when people under@@ go people in living creatures .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three units , each covering four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
guil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , with no property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction process lasts for six months .
that is reasonable .
do the construction companies carry out their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have passed my project correctly .
it is especially complicated to the dam@@ aging Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ash value special and the pitch placement .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did people react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of making luxury installations for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the compet@@ itor for affordable housing ?
Mal@@ dner : indeed , we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only @-@ educated Mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ ator alone .
I show how to build and well build today .
it is about that .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system , when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be required by entering the setting app , &quot; General &quot; type and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if you are ready , phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have been encountered after installation , as they receive an error message that suggests that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create enough - but Apple has made it more likely to do this , but Apple has made it easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgra@@ ding or is located near a loading device , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to be continued , as the phone may turn off on half way , and this could result in a demol@@ ition of the updates .

on the premises of the gas station , three people stopped .
one of these men cried out the young man , and beat this with his f@@ ist in his face .
the sacrifice suffered a nose @-@ hem@@ or@@ gy and ble@@ ed in the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and equi@@ voc@@ ably spoke to the ra@@ cket , he initially adopted his sacrifice .
of his friends , the last young man was now home .
the perpet@@ rators followed the group with a passenger car up to their app@@ artment and out@@ lined up several times .

Dr Frank Müller takes over practice ri@@ ms and investing € 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
furthermore , Sam@@ man @-@ citizenship champ@@ ions Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ising in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places where doctors are missing doctors - As@@ endorf is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice there on October 1 .
during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich considers his successor to the next few months with half a place .
after a modification phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros in the space at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y to the first glance , when the Fel@@ ris@@ aus@@ ens met by Frank Müller and whose wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed her specialist training in the Golden Hospital , who wants to join the practice also in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the garbage can fit perfectly in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ der@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was done , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller was the idea of running its own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so , one was embar@@ king , the garbage trucks bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ stage family Man Frank Müller also grew up , his medical examination in Hannover followed stops in several physician offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a specialist in Sul@@ do , and in 2009 he was appointed chief emer@@ gen@@ cies in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ holz and has been hired as a volunteer in the DRC @-@ read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen working as a resident , his wife has specialized in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the garbage cans , both inter@@ ne@@ es , would like to settle down as house bodies .
thus the end@@ os@@ copy came out , &quot; says 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ gon@@ gol@@ l .
following the conversion , the rooms are look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load EK@@ GS and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro is provided by the district &apos;s framework programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality fee ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; it shows how proudly and happy we are , that the practice is going on , &quot; emphas@@ izes sam@@ pled May@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann .
about 2,000 patients arrive according to Silvia Müller @-@ gon@@ gol@@ l , each quarter into practice ri@@ vals , in which North German average practice are about 500 .
there is another general practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the school of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor has been found , it would have gone .
by the way , who visited the garbage collection , also looks especially in confi@@ dential faces : the seven medical experts appointed and the cleaning force of the rock stand .
their part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf , after all , at least the medical profession had practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; we only had two rooms at the beginning , reminis@@ cent of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
a little wh@@ ist they feel after the long time .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will often see many patients often , &quot; says the intervention .
your husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I pressed me for garden work , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; said Minister for the Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain held parallel .
however , it may be clear that everyone who wants to have an application for asylum is possible , of course , &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that there are clear signals , &quot; the Minister said .
people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , not beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia to be ref@@ using &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would continue to travel for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and plans to establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Minister of Internal Affairs , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not look at Lai@@ bach in Lai@@ bach .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia can rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary .
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled by the Schengen Area .
just like the Minister of Ministers , Slo@@ veni@@ da also wants its limitations for refugees but not un@@ lock .
&quot; every EU member has to fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ no@@ dar .
as the Croatian government had ha@@ sted , the first refugees had already tried to arrive at night hours at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to depart for registration in Eastern Croatia .
the Croatian police were able to interv@@ ene in the near corn fields .
according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles will ever meet new refugees .
it was predominantly about Syrian and Afghanistan , among them numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the days ahead of his country with some 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would also be brought to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which previously introduced migrants to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to attack certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said .
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian fron@@ tier town of Si@@ d during the morning , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were all about the night from the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary , so we told the police that we should go back here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this might actually be in fact , in fact , ob@@ servers already predic@@ t ob@@ servers of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ized that his country for the case of a strong supply of refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible shooting situations .
details he did not name , but he pointed out that Croatia had as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; full potential for border control . &quot;
to qualify through strict controls , in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has been part of this state since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed through a good testimony to what concerns the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees still stuck behind the Hungarian border crossing .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing hor@@ g@@ os who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now travelling to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local intern in Hor@@ g@@ os : he stop the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed , for early .
it is currently not going to be very high refugee numbers .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
hel@@ pers for Mig@@ rants - Alternative items
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees of the refugees , on which alternative routes across Croatia have drawn .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , there is still no more spacious mine@@ fields after the end of the conflict .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine au@@ dits was sent in the border region .
stock ex@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay $ 30 million
Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard at a ring of Cyber@@ crime who is accused of having given insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites like Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
with the exploited information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made to the financial markets .
thus , a total of over 100 million dollars were killed in this way .
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are finally tra@@ pped , &quot; says the SEC registration .
the trials against 32 further susp@@ ects were continued in the case .

the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ an aid was attentive to this action on its 20th anniversary and definitely looks mixed with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ an aid stands for the pass@@ ers as well as questions and discussions at the same time as the volunteer workers .
while some pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously takes the cra@@ yon and the sentence to &quot; my life asser@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
again , on the br@@ ink of small discussions develop on the action , about life , how to deal with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on the spot .

therefore this public @-@ effective action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
that not everyone wants to let anyone speak on the tablets , but it is understand@@ able , finally , it was a very personal matter .
the death of death and die is still subject to Tab@@ us , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , who just contributed much to the tro@@ users movement in recent years to open the people .

&quot; I see the life from another warm , hold it for precious and sh@@ immer@@ ing the moment , &quot; she says .
the offer of out@@ patient &apos;s ec@@ umen@@ ical salary is free and con@@ ven@@ ed traffic .
the financial support of health insurance companies and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as for trainings and sem@@ iconduc@@ tors .

F@@ ed@@ Ex Results mixed , Financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the v@@ ans @-@ gig@@ ant lowered his profit outlook for a year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his boat transport service .
the firm also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for a holiday .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share actually fell by over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the business year that ends in the next May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the less@@ er view despite the price increases , which amounts to 4.9 per cent , and will take effect on January 4 , and despite the higher sur@@ charges for boat transport of heavy and large packages that will be obtained from November .
the company said that it is nonetheless expected to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online retail .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company generates solid income in regard to weaker economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for a holiday employment have been announced a day later than the form of the rival UPS , which plans to set 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts predic@@ t .
net sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the out@@ packs demanded an expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline of international priority shipping companies to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in its unit express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping raised the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent during transport goods by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit posted higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings fell in freight transport due to higher cost of work .
at Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spent two days a week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade the lad@@ z@@ ins .
talking about them at an end of the complicated , two @-@ storey seat of seating there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder of that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission of Congress : maxim@@ ize U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that it is a not @-@ driven third term . financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predic@@ t them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to become we@@ aned from the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , the latest turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets have to increase these vol@@ atility by raising the interest of interest for federal debt - and it is also only by one quarter of one point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ers @-@ company Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the rate of interest not rise , increased in@@ security around the global market enough just@@ ification , continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed will do , which un@@ sec@@ ures himself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have been questioned about Bloomberg , have predicted an interest in this week .
financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the share market , in case the F@@ ed puts the set , unless they promise that the strateg@@ ists v@@ ices a strike by promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ ,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy estimate the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; I would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they do not go into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that the interest rate would be cal@@ med by the financial markets , because it would remove the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act .
still before a month the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow mer@@ ging of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ella had said that in this year , despite the complaints of Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the proposition was granted .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment looks .
contrac@@ tors have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation constantly ran under the annual rate of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and takes them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of the month , after China upgraded its currency .
the Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May when investors were afraid that a slow@@ ing down from the Chinese economy would under@@ go global growth .
the market is re@@ covering a little bit in this month , although the Dow now is almost 10 % below the High E@@ noch of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculation , when to increase interest .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy would not appear in the last few weeks , Mr. D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of US bank@@ note bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better in the handle .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main focus of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the she@@ er hint of the former head of Leit@@ z Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could close their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; could bring confusion about the world around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , it can monitor from the F@@ ed representatives that they do not only monitor the developments in other areas , but also with other central banks and experts , to maintain a better understanding of the global economy .
their decision @-@ making is &quot; more arts than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a story of transition effects on financial market movements , which were apparently linked to the economic foundation figures . &quot;
L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set itself for advertising growth , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its duc@@ ers by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a lim@@ it@@ able effect on growth in the United States , &quot; said L@@ acker .
one year later , the F@@ ed representative revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market crash in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ations do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is afraid of interest rate because the markets trem@@ bling , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act always contains the double mandate and menti@@ ons not the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should require the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
for them to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of the volunteer workers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is quite a number of people who support non @-@ profit seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she also still teaches with her 74 L@@ ence .
every Thursday she is working at the D@@ ill@@ inger street in the asylum seek@@ ers .

Brazilian p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian p@@ aci@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization Sp@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy women on how important good diet is during stand@@ still . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted in frag@@ mentation , which are painted with represent@@ ations of harmful food .
breast milk consists of a wide variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies every nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers is advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake was not the only dietary change to be carried out with mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet may neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
special exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ried Municipal Council approved the building application for the Euro 2.3 million co@@ sting sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar fl@@ atter .
the planning for the long @-@ longed turn@@ around at the amber of the Sport@@ Site comes step by step forward : in the youngest common plan , the designed building application was blessed without large discussions .
before , the Committee had adopted a request for a complete &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ecting &quot; liberation &quot; of the proper development plan .
for the &quot; exception &quot; we went to permit a special form to the roof construction .
therefore a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ ory first and sky@@ rocket can be built . &quot;
background of planning is the scheduled use of the roof space for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonder@@ fully big South @-@ roof , &quot; commented mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; it revol@@ ved around the ti@@ lt of energy for energetic reasons - unlike the development plan for energy - below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is significantly reduced in the hall &apos;s volumes .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof dis@@ like no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ers of the Church in general is rather restric@@ tive in the liberation of liberation .
however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not make preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gy@@ nec@@ c@@ law at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs are estimated to be about 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected by school and latitude .
in the next reporting step , the construction supplement for the 18 x 36 metres of Halle is now submitted to the Coun@@ cil@@ or .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed in early as planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station , as well as the majority of employees prefer from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH located in the district of Land@@ kre@@ ise , confirmed the land department Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
however , a decision on this will meet the supervisory board , and the best to come on Wednesday , 23rd of September .
if the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au beside the fisher@@ man and the next stop to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff , who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered at W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff are informed of the plans .
it has caused the change of dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the beginning of medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now changes to a private practice near the hospital .
the question of who wants to succeed , came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game which was willing to take over the direction from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; and so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
ski@@ pping for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board intends to lead both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ader@@ ie , which still has more than 35 beds , will definitely be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the district had planned for 2018 if the current reconstruction at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ r@@ é@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , has stood contrary to what the house which is owned by the federal government , in the future as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry living there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has worked as a chief resident for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the post of medical directors .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was still threatened by closure , departments had been closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

a crime susp@@ ects has led the police on the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 year @-@ old was killed , the young people killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in rock breaks .
one of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is one of the victims of the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation in the German residential market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek for affordable housing .
pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is a challenge .
the distribution strug@@ gles on the German home market have long begun .
more people are pushing onto the market for refugees and labor exploration in the EU , which is now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
at this result , a study was conducted on behalf of the federation of social housing . &quot;
in comparison , 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
there@@ with , 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
for the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a initial accommodation .
many stum@@ ble on the housing market and in the long queu@@ es , in front of the apartments .
according to Stati@@ stical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were able to rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only in rising waves .
the study also makes considerable fail@@ ures in the housing policies of recent years .
Germany creates a residential construction which is t@@ aller from year to year .
at the present there were approximately 77@@ 0.000 residential units in the ball areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many employed people lived in large cities in large cities .
young adults remained un@@ necessarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flood .
in major cities the number of square metres per capita has fallen back in recent years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
in doing so new incenti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing .
thus , the under@@ growth tax would be om@@ itted and the land tax for funded rentals will be reduced .
according to the Alliance , there are also attractive tax dis@@ continued possibilities .
the support program for refugee status of the Kf@@ W state bank is now well in towns and communities .
a good week after the start was at the Monday evening with 184 million euros , more than half of those available at the disposal of some 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free nor@@ ms : Croatia and Slovenia are serving a corridor
after Hungary , practically no pass is coming , since more refugees are going to vote on Croatia .
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without a hur@@ dle .
dangerous is the route nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with Slovenia &apos;s neighbouring Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian interior minister , and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian interior minister , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
after the annex@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees forced to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people had entered via the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , in the Croatian TV RTL radio .
on the day before , Hungary had blocked his border for refugees .
new laws that came into force on the same day are practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; you can travel , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police captured first refugees at the border of Serbia concerning the border of Serbia .
most of the media reports indicate that from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they were both by bus and taxi in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to reach on foot via the green border to Croatia .
although there are no f@@ ences in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not f@@ ences .
for this , the border crossing will hide another dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90 &apos;s .
mining metho@@ des should now quickly create a secure passage .
according to Hungary , barely any refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 oppos@@ ing people .
shortly before tor@@ tion on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws repe@@ aled the over@@ coming and damage of the border with us as an off@@ ender .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
the sentences ranging from prison until five years , and the expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration agency , a total of 94 applications were recruited on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ seated &quot; border with a total of 94 applications , including almost all - 93 - most important in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicant &apos;s 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees there .
practically no , however , nobody has granted me to obtain asylum in Hungary .
after the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sitting one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke work@@ ing@@ men began to lift up .
they collected the litter , tens of thousands of people in the outskirts of the road during the last few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were dismant@@ led and one of the near @-@ place at the border place was rebuilt .
nobody wants to build this change .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees arrive .
in addition , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
according to government data , however , around 20,000 migrants were still living in the country .
in Salzburg about 1400 people wait for the continuation of Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , regular groups of refugees met regularly .
Mayor of &quot; Out@@ side &quot; on the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had unexpected from Austria on Sunday but because of the refugee flow in Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and ran along with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars crossed on the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously , we had first settled the un@@ trusted guests , with lunch and beverages .
we have said it , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it was very happy with us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the stran@@ ded train passengers had changed from an ICE in a regional train to Pass@@ au , following the pro@@ clamation that the rail traffic was stopped after Germany , but still on the border .
however , the regional train was shut down before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours lived on Sunday , previously a pair of double @-@ bridge sports and organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án send further thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a apparent field .
instead of helping cement help in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke storage system , our Federal Chancellor was officially abol@@ ished and made public as the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the dark field of Naz@@ ism .
dead @-@ bearing policies are not only those Austri@@ ans which are confron@@ ted in border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
the poultry work must also be discovered that the &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish country , &quot; which they invited and welcome , is nothing more than another refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , given the persistent refugee flow and the autumn , with us human circumstances of protecting people .
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at search of 35,000 winter firm Qu@@ arti@@ eren
Konrad has filled all hands with refugee purposes .
Christian Konrad , it is usual that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to build quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the initial centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great host , &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ mind . &quot;
the Interior Ministry said , on the contrary , from a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad is reck@@ oned with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the next year .
in order to meet the numbers , 35,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can make it .
&quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
he has already conducted talks with the govern@@ ors .
they had assured him , even for the coming Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; says Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
the asylum Coordin@@ ator makes great expectations also in the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Help as we . &quot;
on the platform individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in not@@ ations , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ f@@ iller must have a certain height of the handles or size of the finishing line .
for a temporary time , &quot; emergency standards must apply . &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is successful in order to be successful at Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who don &apos;t just say goodbye to the vision .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic no cost , as they stated themselves .
their employees will want to increase it to three to four .
the own user search was not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz requires a better distribution
there are no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design centers for placing refugees in the city of Linz .
this may not be necessary due to the person affected by the person concerned without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , for the emergency , further sites are to be tested on their capability .
cr@@ iti@@ que exercises the chief of the government to the allocation of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts have to offer their contribution here .
seals er : &quot; borders are not blocked &quot;
in a brief telephone conference with the Bavarian prime minister , Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , state @-@ time Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday is acqu@@ iring another approach in refugee demand .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not blocked .
on the further journey of refugees in the FR@@ G is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
there will be no more special suits with refugees in Germany .
however , the protection seek@@ ers would however be brought with regular trains to Germany .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once more increased solidarity in the refugee question .
the fact that Austria leads to its border with insp@@ ections , is also a logical consequence &quot; by the pioneer of the Germans .
the next Run@@ tastic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in Lin@@ zer industrial line has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 2700 sqm ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in the start @-@ up firms of the New Ship@@ yard and later also which are ac@@ qui@@ d .
from the very beginning S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ tastic is just a question of time . &quot;
in the location , 1.7 million euros has been invested in the location , 3.3 million euros from the tech centre , which belongs to each third of the City of Linz , Upper Austria Upper Austria and the federal state ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been home to the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as the Tech@@ centre .
there are already 30 percent of the 2700 sqm residual area in the building already rented , for another 40 percent increase it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ firm@@ ress opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags stand in the centre .
in fact , J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to change a dog .
this project had to break the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : finally , she has now got the growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop , in which she sells among other things , bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and ra@@ iment of different manufacturers , all around the sale of women &apos;s hand straps are around 75 euros .
larger pockets and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks rebuilt .
&quot; I have considered a long time if I am going to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
decisive for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna can be found by the idea of a special location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the great space of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even took Italian roots .
her fashion interest has been laid by her mother &apos;s cra@@ dle .
I change most , if something is developing and I can demonstrate new trends for performance prices .
why such a woman take a look at a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , can &apos;t answer the technical wife with the last security .
maybe that &apos;s making a beautiful bag of every out@@ fit .
the ro@@ ull@@ man @-@ song@@ writer from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also links with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he comments on foreign host@@ ile , rep@@ ut@@ de journalists , or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidates for the US presidential address em@@ power@@ ing the campaign .
and cut off well .
it is also registered in the cem@@ ic K@@ all@@ city , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of millions come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept of many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf along the wine street .
man@@ holes in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ site is about -@@ zig corners related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; I think that will somehow be exciting , but in their no @-@ ad@@ ter way you are not so impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ ie has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumping events , which beside Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
while there is respect about the performance of the family , but also ten@@ don@@ ating the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit &apos; la@@ zy &apos; , says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high German : the investors , says her .
from the village of An@@ geber , Tr@@ ump comes from the village .
the ump &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the succe@@ eding grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation stone of the property &apos;s property were first property in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from the tragedy : her desire to return to his home , failed on the Bavarian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not take Tr@@ ump , because he once was exhausted without hom@@ olog@@ ation , was the Director of the Institute of Medical History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , for the film start@@ up .
the grand@@ child is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is reflected in contrast to the mit@@ ig@@ old statements of the night .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter them illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arized , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native of Tr@@ ump , &quot; Op@@ a was born in Op@@ a ) .
the wind retired , the Americans are rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so frigh@@ tened . &quot;
do he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never mu@@ til@@ ated around K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension worker in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned how many K@@ all@@ y@@ ad@@ ter menti@@ ons a visit to the Heinz with a visit to the church organ at a visit to what is generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine evil from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
it would be better if he did not make the choice , because &quot; he has such radic@@ ally views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
if those who had his grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ke Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els film , who inter@@ viewed for the ump , have seen 12 000 movie singers , even in the USA w@@ akes its interest .
the Bavarian municipal of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the Vice @-@ Pre@@ sidents of the German alpine club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden national park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing bank &quot; in Austria . &quot;
in neighbouring countries the Alpine Association is responsible for the awar@@ ding of the award .

Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson to report the liber@@ als after the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als and has provided no major shifts in the Today ass@@ essments .
the flight takes from Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed from the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ out managed the Fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of the insur@@ rection appeared to play no part for Australian TV viewers , because the sunrise had an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators with five capit@@ als compared to Today 33@@ ,000 .
today Today launched a slight increase of ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today , in recent months , Today has closed the gap to sunrise .
in August , Today launched an average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
Sun@@ rise has been at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators on average 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today in September .
this is the most interesting , what happens every morning .
the winds of the mur@@ derer concern this morning more than the parliament !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number from Sha@@ to the Raf@@ itter Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recently wi@@ de@@ ed father , who settled down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thomson could bear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ itter Star from Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result from yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and struck easily the Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results at evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( from 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half an hour of The Chase @-@ 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour tot@@ alled 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ sea on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as for the second evening of The Chase Australia , nine are confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at ultimately takes place around 17 : 30 o &apos;clock .

the last three voices are : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who is he who is choosing ?
un@@ cover secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ know@@ ingly obvious who wins The Bachelor .
the woman who finally landed in The bach@@ elor &apos;s house was covered in greatest confidenti@@ ality .
and there is no one of the three remaining girl will certainly not mention whether they are the one who has received the last Rose .
but when we were with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before using three two , you may probably acci@@ dentally put a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips till the final on Thursday .
all three women have pointed out in ly@@ rical ways of why wood is the perfect man and they called it his sense for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive approach as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get the latest Rose ? , &quot; could their answers to gambling ? &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - Mack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had an easy relationship with each other for the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies re@@ marked , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that all over the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
Sarah is on the feet on earth , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that it would be well suited to Sam Wood as a couple .
in their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the last week of her house made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I &apos;m already waiting for him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose who Wood should choose if not she was , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be on 7 pm on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent after an impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne &apos;s rest for the rest of the game when he lost a rum@@ or while the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League Conver@@ t did during his first pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
rather than grin@@ d his ro@@ ok@@ ies to grin@@ d the mill by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne &apos;s public in his press conference following the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reference Cam Editor You reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special E@@ ams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to catch his pat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne &apos;s patented in a pun@@ t which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota vi@@ kings district

after the F@@ um@@ ble , Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not present a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that appears now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne was compared to the rac@@ er in its original debut in 2007 , when a pass at its own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ olds .

&quot; it &apos;s not going on , we have to say about the causes , &quot; said the Free High @-@ elec@@ tor .
past asylum seek@@ ers want to move the free voters as fast as possible .
therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts to be responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum conver@@ ters , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
the FW she@@ ath crit@@ ici@@ zed that several federal states are not resol@@ ute : &quot; we need to country nationwide standards of the states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria is busy , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to be more competitive . &quot;
but the policy in the big wall@@ ets should not fall under the table .
a lot of years of endurance remains on the agenda : the policy policy .
for the new school year , the Minister for Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started the pilot study &quot; middle level plus &quot; with an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ onal middle stage of three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to his secondary school .

&quot; the topic of G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ boss .
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that wish to do so .

4 people killed after police mig@@ ra@@ cies shooting in protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber @-@ fired on a crowd , which had demonstrated the proposed new constitution against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive officials said that over 1,000 protest@@ ers gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire@@ bom@@ bers .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot in the air before returning to g@@ ums .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the g@@ ums , known as the g@@ ums , known to them that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously a high death rate produced .
the dispute was the last week of violent protest at Nep@@ al@@ ese levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would cut their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that would like to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were disp@@ utes in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed a agreement signed the country in provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution since 2008 has been on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ature have agreed this week via certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary report submitted by Ralf Behr@@ ends from the Construction Management Board in the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t made an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Board of Directors and more than 50 visitors .
but it may be good to meet all rum@@ ours right now .
for months past the past ten to twelve million Euros have been involved in the discussion .
sharp reactions under the marine donkeys which came to the meeting were the pictures and new details on the desired hotel structure .
Roberto Schulz , co @-@ owner and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant that is over@@ flowing all other fle@@ ece . &quot;
in addition , as some other project critic , he fears that the traffic was heavily affected by the intended size of the plant : &quot; all the bus charges have to come , so Mr Schulz
what happens in the gut area of a large area of restaurants , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends .

Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations which will save 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that are to help thousands of refugees who are displaced to the European nations as they flee from war and displaced countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donations @-@ call on his blog .
instead of having to make a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , who had fled with her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , talked about her personal experiences .
&quot; on our journey many dark train and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people seek to desper@@ ate for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : physicians without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations can be doubled to a value of € 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / properties called up to $ 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war broke out in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics may be helpful in weight loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new trial in J@@ AM@@ A .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit your body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be effective in obesity , but most studies have been conducted among people who are disease @-@ ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered to be ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : us . us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - magnet@@ ism and stomach mu@@ d@@ ules - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI of those who under@@ go surgery fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who did not receive @-@ surgical treatments ranged from approximately equal to 29 .
among those involved in a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition is completely dissolved and partially at 28 % .
in the medical treatment group , in comparison with diabetes , the group showed only about one percent and partly in only about two percent .
the results were also found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also overs@@ aw the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels during the time .
in A@@ 1@@ c , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best maintained below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it reflects in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not slow the mortality rate in five years , such as the Head of researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also contrac@@ tu@@ ally ver@@ b average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns of the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new trial does not show an survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it had under@@ gone a obesity epidemic in obesity , which had under@@ gone a total of 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for persons with a BMI among 35 who are interested in the process .
&quot; that is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone informed that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously when the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have fixed their body with obesity and diabetes , recur@@ ring is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück

&quot; it is impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not assume all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist guide came upon to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the rising refugee crisis in his speech at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he encouraged the interests of humanity to be submitted to the interests of individual nations or as continents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the response of Western European countries would be ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to find out the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim lands . &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we must re@@ consider how the killing is reduced in their lands .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and issued that the US &apos;s violent reaction moved out a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he set violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
a quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of in@@ gest@@ ion disinf@@ ection by children in the past 4 years
tox@@ ins centres in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which also swal@@ low an alcoholic disinf@@ ection , so the Georgia Po@@ ison center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand disinf@@ ection was reported among children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins centres report , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are always more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the listing , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some kids could drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ually at the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of an inexpensive experience .
teenagers allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ alcohol mouth water to receive a harder drink .
younger children can be sho@@ cked by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , grapes and orange du@@ el , which are very attractive for children .
hand disinf@@ ection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison note centre at the Hospital of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t make a si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come on it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es from the school after strawberry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ection was taken in school , was brought into an emergency response .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of which is considered as being drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor that treated them at G@@ tiny Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the notation .
doctors overs@@ aw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and bowed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin Mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers , non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants to be used outside the child &apos;s reach .
using alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario , after the end of the disinf@@ ection of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suggest that the product was me@@ thanol , a le@@ thal solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ alkoh@@ ol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class were planning to pois@@ oned their &quot; mas@@ cul@@ ine &quot; teacher , for@@ getting anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic against hanging applications and t@@ anned them from their room .
the police lied to the instruc@@ tors &apos; Plan as &quot; D@@ w@@ add@@ z &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary measures to the school authority .

de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there are a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m game , and there are not only the people in Scotland that want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian boss re@@ inst@@ ate things to turn things .
following the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , who now stand at the head of the table with five points .
and Sh@@ eila said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had already been bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as quickly as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly as - but we must continue .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic support because that makes the players better .
now , it is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over the figure of 5.5 per cent , as the numbers of offices shown for national statistics ( for dating only ) .
meanwhile , the employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the unemployment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the annual UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the recent figures , the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline of unemployment .

why I will witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in an spectators gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by the poison syr@@ inge .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day was approaching , I started afraid to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US , and since often more applicants have available as seats , a ma@@ je@@ wel lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected , who will watch it emotional .
I cannot do that .
I &apos;m sitting next to Richard Glos@@ s@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone lines and a two and a half hours visiting .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
the jail @-@ authorities say that I do not have a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook &amp; pen in order to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of embar@@ king on Twitter , my in@@ parti@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she admitted that she could wish to form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I have spoken and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses every time .
but he wants to be an international rep@@ orters to write there .
he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help ag@@ grav@@ ate the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of Podcasts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ es would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of de@@ ed .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him die .
I can not claim , really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , in which you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man of unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to trigger him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ ion in his st@@ ables by year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he acted to the ste@@ wards and the Integration Unit of Racing Victoria , claiming that they lead a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and himself found himself in difficult conditions as it was concerned about the positive Kob@@ ol@@ atro@@ pha in Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months for sp@@ ying accus@@ ations , and didn &apos;t want to see it &quot; see as high @-@ dro@@ oping grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing about it and I &apos;ve been doing it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything appears at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know it has gone far@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live what I have said .
I &apos;m going to go home today and sleep well .
I want to go about the main actor , and I would like to think that my owners think that I tried my best to try .
if they start thinking , I do that , then I should not be a coach anymore .
then I have to think about what I do with my license .
before that , Moo@@ dy had the bomb in an interview with the rac@@ er that the Integration Unit had tried to escal@@ ate its stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I &apos;ll get asked , and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am an im@@ post@@ or .
if that is the case , they should certainly take care of her n@@ oses , because she is trying to deal with me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of Route L , David Moo@@ die , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ xe , CEO of Route L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
would that lead me to think that it is personally ?
did the Route L behave ti@@ ly , and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
is I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there , that I am there .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter me , and that makes me feel sorry .
that really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and pushing it to make a decision .
I have support my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it Less@@ ons of Train@@ ers have built up with the long lasting b@@ ump in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could throw his license through the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the non @-@ camp Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied on the horse &apos;s deb@@ ated .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to assume the full responsibility for it , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my colleagues has er@@ ron@@ ged mud on the leg .
it could be so yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday all the day so it was like that .
but it had so on the race day too .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the racing day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set those rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson : the arbit@@ rators brought the Storm @-@ players &apos; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm Vic@@ tory at the qualifying finals in Sydney Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a ti@@ pped note to the Storm @-@ Team , after his team had reached the Final win against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday nights . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; by the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland does not &quot; too good &quot; in the ring .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team , and said that she is only concentr@@ ating on the tac@@ kling , only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy then added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team is confident , since it cons@@ ented that they are worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s always up again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson rep@@ lied about Ring@@ ers when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing about our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles for a real gravity , and that has been done for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he apparently has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a little shock for him .
it &apos;s funny , as it always dives at the time of the season .
Bell@@ amy was attacked by Benn@@ ets using the &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or to remember that Benn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he &apos;s a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game to play , if you like this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , making it as they can play .
I build stronger confidence , because they tell these things because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it went to the Big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster got a higher result than the Game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 and there were two attempts in our game but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks ? are there any points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they do mention us , it means we will be meeting in a stage yet .
the Storm team has free , as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bs with 200,000 deposit con@@ jec@@ ting according to drug suits
a man who may possibly have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence to come to the possession of 40 kilos of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were ador@@ ned by Queensland , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug in the yacht Sol@@ ay coming from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a perhaps life sentence for the attempt to have a commercial volume co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café of a harmless reason could have been .
judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the haz@@ ard risk of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the case , he lied to the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and father @-@ in @-@ law offered a $ 200,000 deposit as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the practical explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judges Flanders .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports on the police daily and is holding an initial dam from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to sending pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone for an 11 year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the voice of the girl when this slept , log@@ ged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ related pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using news and al@@ ar@@ ous@@ ed her mother immediately .
the police took over and looked after the five pictures , analyzed the computer , which were found under the address and found &quot; question @-@ related &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , who used concepts for searching for non @-@ permanent pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claims to the officials , that he would have done it , because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile &quot; in the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the lawyer in Ei@@ li@@ ie Robertson said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a diction , that he is addic@@ tive , to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the searching for the computer were carried out from him , but said that it was done , because he wanted to say a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asking him to send out more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick of his head when he drinks , and said that he would see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on her phone , she called her mother , and was on the trem@@ or and of weeping .
she then saw the accused images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Playst@@ ation used to talk to girl who looked much younger than he .

defense attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g is not published in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one may argue that &quot; no considerable sexual element &quot; was found in his interests .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael Announ@@ ces the judgment until October to maintain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings at other pending cases .
he was still accepted before the date of judgement into the sexual off@@ ender directory .
are locks on small border transfer to Germany
more refugees are taken away from the large @-@ Austrian border region at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tugs were driven out of fear of discovery and capture of people with smaller border @-@ trans@@ itions
out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police spoke .
along the border crossing Inn , Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have been picked up more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday .
they were walking on foot via bridges and dust down on the German side .
there they are received by federal polic@@ emen in reception and re@@ directed to registration .
at the Munich Main Railway station , the police dis@@ continued much more refugees after the start of the week on Wednesday .
some 700 people have arrived in the provincial capital alone at 8 : 00 am , a spokes@@ man for the morning .
after the introduction of insp@@ ections at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ erun@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; worth in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a deep pressure from Western Europe , warm sea air in the country distributed the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strong fit was the for@@ erunner of the tropical jungle &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drag@@ ged over the Atlantic in recent days over the past few days .
heavy storms and storms are expected primarily in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning even in the Black Forest , on the Schw@@ äb@@ ische Al@@ b and Ground @-@ Se@@ as@@ meeting with ar@@ ches of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour , is too late .
on Friday , the sun lets you look back .
the mass makes it : every two years the car drivers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
especially in 2015 , it is mainly moving to a compact car that is currently selling well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 28,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals accounted for at this segment , according to the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ist 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , numerous new models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for German motor@@ ways is the Opel Astra , which will be tra@@ ced to tra@@ ders in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann along the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order to sell the volume model well , the new Astra is designed to do not much more expensive .
Opel presents its entry under the largest competition VW Golf , which starts at € 17 million .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is available only as a fifth .
the second variant will follow in spring of the station w@@ agon , which is also shown at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA &quot; Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra range Mé@@ gan@@ e racing .
at the fair , Mé@@ gan@@ e is only five @-@ door experienced in a conventional and highly stressed sporty GT @-@ version .
in the trade , it comes into the beginning of next year , then a station w@@ agon .
Infin@@ iti : entirely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan &apos;s branch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
so the compact Infin@@ iti with its wav@@ ed lines perfectly fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ ac : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ ac , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
its maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ ac in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not quite new , but completely renovated , the compact class DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Citroën Editor &apos;s hand in front of the front panel : here the radiator grill was dra@@ fted and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , which reduces the number of buttons via a touch screen and is first integrated using Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
on the IAA in the compact class at the IAA in compact class a series of over@@ working and new variants like the newly ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are in@@ valuable
the Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel Palace of Justice , which was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell .
because of the injury of human rights , prisoners are generally entitled to compens@@ ate for financial compensation when they are in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision on Wednesday .
they may even hope for the judges to make money even if they were imprisoned in the close rooms for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee was successfully completed in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was no spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who has been re@@ located on free foot after his An@@ wal@@ ts has been re@@ located in a larger cell .
because of the terrible conditions of adher@@ ence to Berlin in Berlin , his term of adher@@ ence against the Berlin country fail .
however , the Constitutional Court took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of the Berlin and had to return the case for the renewed test .
they see the man &apos;s human being hurt .
Kammer@@ gericht decides on the amount of the compensation
although legal reasons for the frag@@ ile period only a few days of prison for the compensation had to be decisive , there was a declaration of compensation .
otherwise , it would be &quot; a mis@@ fortune of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitu@@ ents have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they only spoke in April to a prisoner of damage , because he was imprisoned in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , according to the multi@@ ple@@ tion of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe , also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which a prisoner of men had agreed to a decent housing in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place over three months daily between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ bad case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have been hit the head@@ lines in the last few weeks .
prisoners are therefore being ro@@ oted up again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness of aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to s@@ nat@@ ches if it had already been able to s@@ nat@@ ch it .
according to information of the judicial review , 21 positions in Te@@ gel were not occupied due to young od@@ or , 19 should be dropped in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to assume it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany in accordance with forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Health this year , according to the statement by Viz@@ ek@@ anz@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated how the unusual challenge proves to be clear : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany , the following overview .
they are used to produce different forecasts ranging from 350@@ 000 ( E@@ estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( E@@ stim@@ ate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) annually , and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all at affordable rental properties : annually 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing is out of the lease agreement , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion per year .
in addition , scientists and federal state are that there must be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 percent of the poultry industry can already be employed in Germany over the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not require a systematic approach to their quali@@ fications to help them get started by Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ri@@ hardt .
according to the throne , in Germany , according to the throne , there was a political shift : the ban on refugees for the recognition of labor .
while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers for more than five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the resi@@ den@@ ces that asylum seek@@ ers have been confin@@ ed to a place for asylum .
in society , too , the visibility was due - even because of the lack of goods that refugees should be made faster of access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the job market are missing German language skills .
so far , there is no exclusive offer of general and business @-@ related language courses .
research shows that work@@ stations are often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , the building of networks is therefore according to the throne from Thr@@ ri@@ hardt to work @-@ integration .
the Berlin school government determined that only a few escaped parents to give her children into the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 per cent . &quot; for the ent@@ e@@ av@@ ed parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ de@@ able , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of K@@ ita , the management boards are distributed in different languages .
if the demand for the teachers have risen strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities , by appro@@ ving more special schools .
students , without German knowledge classes , are being prepared for classes in the countries .
they are not always taught by full educated teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack to them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin school administration .
the German student estimates that some 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State asylum seek@@ ers or commem@@ oration of the study - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position but abandoned .
study illi@@ es in refugees could facilitate access to the university .
because refugees are allowed to be allowed to permit or for@@ tification , there are no more services after asylum seek@@ ers .
the latter basically does not get B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G because they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ood .
the f@@ ug@@ iti@@ ed refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany so far , to be entitled to B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G entitled to be reduced from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , but also challenge Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ ash@@ ö@@ G .
Islam is in future play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of its identity .
the state should be gradually emp@@ tied to Islam under the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches would develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be the creation of a Islamic welfare state that takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers in professional manner .
the rights also may also belong to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must unite and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to pass some control possibilities .
to this it also belongs to willingness , producer against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced concern for religious conflicts , could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will be much more than today , a subject from all society .
in doing so , the company &apos;s majority society will need to change the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
Germany - indeed - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination Office since the first decade and an establishment of gender equality law .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NSU @-@ magazine , showed in the police and authorities systematically ignor@@ ing the rac@@ ist motive .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stak@@ eholder groups negoti@@ ate for a long time , and for what international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism in Germany must under@@ take effect when the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
General , Germany , in general , should be able to medic@@ ally provide medical services so far , said Professor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we can do this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , cor@@ relate to all the derivatives of the registration health card .
later , services could be calculated using the federal states .
and in the long term it was highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited performance catalog will advance to the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , physicians will make the language bar@@ riers .
even so far , in the Berlin @-@ scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de , the Berlin @-@ scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has documented migrants worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician offices would have to be acquired , and calls for them .
many are also helped to help refugees with more common medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic eyes .
in the refugee camp for instance , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and with the young people it is going to take care of HIV .
Mont@@ gom@@ ery , some of the other disease images , came to German doctors .
the paras@@ ite fall or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and as for the medical angel , with the refugees , in sight , even in sight .
the Syrians have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even physicians .
in order to practice , however , they would have to as@@ sign their quali@@ fications and if needed .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is based on estimates of the bund@@ les chain ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulner@@ able to the refugee camp , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains the president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich is demonstrated that every fifth Syrian refugee ship was trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from flash backs , short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart rate and death rows .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong scre@@ aming and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , an early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z stated .
until now , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get psycho@@ therapy .
true , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the welfare offices , but most of them usually take several months .
in addition , in the social em@@ akers of mostly commercial workers or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy was necessary or not .
this calls frequently to mal@@ in@@ ess , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse in the post@@ ure of zir@@ cons are only very often subject to different animal protection organisations .
Stephanie Temp@@ orary also takes a position : &quot; is it not good for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a complete unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sten , &quot; as they are called lov@@ ingly , will be read by their eyes any wish .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to make it into the arena .
so the top commandment means : good for the animals .

Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , falling down the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by the claims of the opposition of the opposition , that they had received anonymous deaths and warned them against Mr Mug@@ abe , with Mr Mug@@ abe .
in the past month , they burned it out and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .

&quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said to Mug@@ ab@@ es .
they warns the members of the Parliament that the immun@@ ity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the chief speaker said that Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i managed party to be &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard becomes up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to accommodate 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the scope of restructuring and saving effort in the company &apos;s services .
hp will split up this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business of its rapidly growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job positions resulted in a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more competitive cost framework for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , to manage the unit after the separation .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide range of businesses looking for transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better par@@ ked than ever to satisfy the changing requirements of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ achieved , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; as a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company established in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to produce electric plants and their Palo Alto Garage you called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has under@@ gone a massive re@@ structure to handle the conversion of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that a tight company generates a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate has to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t even play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already suggests that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big shame with this current problem is that Wil@@ der had badly finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury isn &apos;t threatened the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that was not well healed .
this is no bigger thing .
it was only an accident .
it was not in connection with its ank@@ le , or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from purely medic@@ inal view , but as Wen@@ ger also accepted , there is the accompanying risk of other injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops a non @-@ angen@@ tial pattern .
the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses in Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years .
he also played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ and performances in the last five times .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , most of the most vulner@@ able days have to be recorded .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but ar@@ senal estimated that an improvement in the po@@ aching ratio during the last season is going .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a long period of time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will succeed in doing a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsenal begins its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo of Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces itself to the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not driving according to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta is supposed to start .
Wen@@ ger may also begin with k@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and the players who need it to gain a small bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal are clear by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was 3,2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is convinced that ar@@ senal of the past season has attracted the champ@@ ions of the Champions League against Monaco and remains driven by far hope to lead the association with its first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ ship : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons on defects
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially in regard to how the need for men to open up , now is more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how self @-@ mor@@ als prove among young men on a 15 year yo@@ ke .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aign against Living Mis@@ er@@ ase ( CA@@ LM ) announced as a man &apos;s embar@@ rass@@ ing life in 2015 , with the aim to issue the culture in question to seek the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of our fight to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances are doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends only so that friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on the style of substance , is often more important in response to the response .
our digital life have the need to appear strongly , fun and successful , even if the isolation domin@@ ates in effect .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists indicate ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire explained recently , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , radi@@ ated by interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ug@@ s , Mom@@ ents at football player in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire for Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can rely on each case even if they are often kept back to explore completely their feelings .
as one employee of the phone care I explained to me : ... &quot; my listen@@ er for people who are de@@ pressed people and are confident , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in a position to talk to friends .
the old phr@@ asing &quot; I come with this right , &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when you &apos;re talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term preser@@ ving Mechan@@ isms .
she clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s kin@@ ships .
so much my objective external se@@ ash@@ ite status via telephone the people in moments of despair can help in despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally new back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone watching him a smile and say hello .
one never knows what the difference might make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for the Friend@@ ship Festival
Mary meets Mary to help PS@@ G to un@@ lock the Malmö
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh in Cav@@ ani for his time against Malmö .
di Maria met in his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G direct to Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Mary and Edinburgh son visited Cav@@ ani as Paris Saint @-@ Germain has started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but after that , they missed a series of opportunities before she finally raised their lead in the 6@@ 1st minute a head of headphones .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A you need a strong start against the Swedish masters , as they do not only stri@@ ve the qualification for the N.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round , but improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ h@@ ov@@ ics missed chances before the gate . he was later began in the game against his home @-@ home team and against the club , with which he started his illustr@@ ate career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to cause our opponents to cause problems and relaxed back , even though there are certain things we have to finish in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; it is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I am sorry we had not yet scored one or two more gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ Nit@@ ovic returned after his wound in one of three modifications to the Paris @-@ Team , which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was kicked @-@ out in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argentin@@ ian wing extrem@@ ist was called the man named PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he ran in the last month of Manchester United , as he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense , before returning to Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
however , if somebody believed that PS@@ G would have a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic took place in an Play @-@ off to achieve this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was up@@ lifting with a five @-@ man def@@ ending and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they afflicted them little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself appeared sometimes on , with some patches with flaws and bad termin@@ ations , not least in the first half patented and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he told much more skill when he brought his players to the game and it was a pass of Ibra@@ h@@ ott@@ ovic , which was transformed by Paul Maria in a shooting down which was guided by Wil@@ t in the 5@@ 2nd minute during the pole ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the Cav@@ ani mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er also achieved its sixth year of season , after he had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
it finished all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ t from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could stop the end result , before the subst@@ it@@ utes Ez@@ ech@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi could be sc@@ anned a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

world and European champion X@@ avi have been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern occurred obviously some years ago prior to the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which played at the time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish Champion , three times winner champion , four times champion Champions League winner , two times champion champion , two times European champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to Qatar to take the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi showed that he was already going to go from Barcelona in front of the European Parliament before the European Parliament in 2008 .

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a sequence of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , as these stressed the necessity of alternative perspectives , emphas@@ ized in regards to a black protagon@@ ists in the elected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do in the occupation of the film and not with the instrum@@ entation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ating un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actors from The Mar@@ tian re@@ lie@@ ve .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director - as it will handle the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown initially .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ lin@@ t sm@@ itten one of her white Zu@@ h@@ ens .
the producer of Man White People sat down to the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right on the film ; Dam@@ on answered her direction &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s why it is hurt . &quot;
Twe@@ et publisher more than 5.000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
for Dam@@ on &apos;s comments occurred at a time in the exact copy of racial representation in the media at the head of the social discussion .
after teenage Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter was nationwide and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to enjo@@ in discrimin@@ ating practices against col@@ li@@ ent in@@ fest@@ ation .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; Alb@@ ums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said .
as books and black life , albums are still their significance .
in younger time , leaders of the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation , namely , in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , that Dam@@ on was invited to discuss the Pope &apos;s list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le which are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation , or has already taken the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports clim@@ bs and control assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ lete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition Show , which had just finished her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , which could shut up all steps of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the climbing was on a 75 @-@ foot cable @-@ rope in 30 seconds for the final task .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first Ath@@ lete who finished the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge a full three seconds faster , which made him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the harsh weather win , still under the shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his hor@@ des of money .
as quite suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the Director @-@ producer K@@ ent We@@ ed won with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all , did not get any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one receives the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great atro@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s got a groove on this .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the crowds of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family Man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have equally felt when they played the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to an eighth season , which will start fil@@ ming in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ anders in Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ N@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but this part was perfect for the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins signed a chance to climb up in a game part of Houston ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card room .
for Detroit , though only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to deal with a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad dem@@ ise .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two in@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 of the staff and made it possible for three victories .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to move quite concentrated in the game .
the newly designated Tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , its first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits for the Seattle marin@@ ers on 6 July .
&quot; he raised the fire@@ wood well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked fine ( impact training ) , looked well better from the bull@@ se@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh interior , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon launched his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the kn@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy rolled off the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he became the newly designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano who became a two @-@ run .
with a pair of sk@@ irt and the conclusion @-@ run during the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought Tre@@ vor Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
it was the major league leading the 27th time in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe stroke a double play .
after Detroit joining a net @-@ Run from the end of ninth inside the Wall , the Wall achieved a R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed tip prot@@ rac@@ ted S@@ ano by three pit@@ ches for its Fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited for opening the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hugh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three stages in the first two inst@@ ances against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the danger of injuries in front of the game after having been missing more than one month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I liked it , &quot; said Hugh@@ es , &quot; But I felt better when I started and felt that I would have some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Batt@@ les on the first hand , H@@ einer gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s action to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; with the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third B@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right side , managed another Run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to enter the third on which the threat posed .
the Tig@@ ers put on the second one @-@ out Double @-@ Out of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
he didn &apos;t work especially well , but he got the right spot .
Hugh@@ es was found in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , made no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver legal right A.@@ J.@@ A@@ gar .
Hugh@@ es made three hits on six hits and a walk with four con@@ ti@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was eliminated because of a lim@@ b injury .
he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who was oper@@ able at the Sanchez University in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list for a shoulder @-@ hole , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with Sanchez C@@ ause from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the vulner@@ ability of injuries to start T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since then he was acquired with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of the town of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io hill were christ@@ ened on the name of the German reform .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now being honoured &quot; as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for the Lutheran churches of the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , a pastor of the Protestant Lutheran congregation in Rome , remembered that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often living as a minority in the secret of their faith .
with the square , in symbolic mode , it reveals that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the year 1510 / 11 .
he recommended the city back then as a sin@@ ner @-@ b@@ able .

hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt have painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who form@@ ulated his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but in no way equ@@ alled with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , adjusted the respective topics , it can seem quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he met a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic option among the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles , which are subject to topics such as crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
in doing so , he spont@@ aneously posts several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its main focus on art books .
and there is , especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on painting with the respective bi@@ ble positions .
he interpreted the Bible interpre@@ ts by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al Spiegel of Al@@ ts painting .
in fact , it is nestled between the original perio@@ dical of Martin Luther and one of the artist &apos;s original condition , which form@@ ulates his personal idea about the respective situation .
the jewelry cord wra@@ ps .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old also allows for a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately at all the trig@@ gers of the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and raised in Berlin , coming from a family which belonged to the strict si@@ ze@@ al mist@@ rust .
&quot; when the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt reminds himself .
&quot; I tried to stop working , perhaps to wear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ assess art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ inations is marked today by advertising , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight , to show things .
images always have a bit mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost st@@ acked on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always been &quot; an lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like what he understands with his pictures . &quot;
I haven &apos;t believed to capture the Bible completely , but those important for him , also myst@@ ical themes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the league is a clear sign in the weekend .
football re@@ acts on the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of helping the rising problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must make everyone interested in getting this theme in the handle , &quot; DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach said .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the State Minister for Women Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could be and wanted to help .
but the decisive points must place the policy .
therefore , the German soccer federation has expanded its refugee quot@@ ations &quot; 1 : 0 for an Welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we ensured through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; Mr Nier@@ s@@ bach went on the ver@@ ge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
even some federal states support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ bre@@ l set a clear sign if it is on the left tri@@ cot Car@@ mel instead of the usual signal of sponsor@@ ing ( Hermes ) to contribute to &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ chief Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama passed every one , no one shall see it . &quot;
&quot; we can use football federal states , no , we need to use our jet power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have already been so incredible , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent mark of the League . &quot;
the national team quali@@ fier for Hungary on this Friday invites women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach distinguished the support of refugees as a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements would have launched their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is living in the football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; the clubs have already called for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .

with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use an international network that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the federal government also aims to apply to a change in Vienna &apos;s Convention , which so far only humans can see as driver .
by automated driving , the car will take over leadership , the driver becomes more and more to passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the automated driving on high@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , passenger vehicles can still be expected to be on public roads &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot;
the authors of the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features at location Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 on about 8.4 billion euros .
the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD Transport S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be explicitly clari@@ fied .
the Germans are still scep@@ tical about the Germans , however - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on the AA pen@@ it@@ isation survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ ario @-@ Institute in DE@@ K@@ RA , only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be en@@ forced in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 will count as 33 percent in the US .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of digital output , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire drive on all roads .
on the highway no less than 15 percent could be present at the flow of traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
well all v@@ ases would not leave the car to control under any circum@@ stance .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequins , which look forward to video projections thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who became stage out@@ fits among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits in the great star of fashion scene - so that he put men in co@@ ats .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have a white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , but in the meantime it was real , &quot; Gaul@@ tier says .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk to The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th September at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation , it is lucky that the fashion designer has changed his mind to a show about his person .
actually , he would have been , for : &quot; an exhibition really sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you arrive to the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal , Montreal and Paris Station .
it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren !
it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this barely visible work of the man , who has written fashion history without having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ographic work that was done for much effort : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist is engaged .
14 tons of material have turned the makers according to the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution was a special Sch@@ man@@ ger : a leather watch@@ man out@@ fit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are scar@@ city than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier .
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender look of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in the soccer ) he was attracted to his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
with a doll to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
he then taught the dis@@ card of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion perio@@ dic@@ als and looked at the designs of other designers , just as G@@ aul &apos;s in Munich .
later I bought that , but of course .
for his first review , he had not able to pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the cl@@ am@@ ans .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener top as fashion niche
previously , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around pl@@ uses to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large amount for customers , covering for example , blank@@ ets and curtains .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains , managing director of the Rein@@ hart .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ght , fashion has played a greater part , was pushed into the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is called some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans against the le@@ po@@ kes is an increasing customer potential .
who has no niche in Germany in the textile branch , is no longer in the market .
they are already doing the half of all orders .
Rein@@ bars Pl@@ auen is a member of nine other companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Ho@@ und and Em@@ bro@@ i@@ dery .
only they can carry out the protected label .
in the last 15 years , some 80 percent of its sales were broken off .
private business transactions and wholesale , there are almost no more .
our products hardly reach the customer on this path .
the mass goods will be much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region and is almost exclusively sold through chains .
the export , current to Russia and the United States , are also weaker .
so enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the embroi@@ dery at Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality , which shows that we can produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger holding of the Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au , Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to op@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
there is an area between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design is often only varies to hold a customer base .
some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly discovered the historic snow @-@ tip .
ste@@ aling the machine in some places small cu@@ v@@ ets .
the do@@ cking Gold@@ schmi@@ ede in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ x inspired him : &quot; before that I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of pl@@ au@@ ght - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors would have lived in pl@@ ush and surroundings , who want a mem@@ ento .
with this , I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the Pl@@ au@@ ge tip .

XI is p@@ ushes to open the economy to the world
the economy must open from outside to the outside to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday a group that was commissioned with steering the steering .
&quot; China should apply to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how , and strategies for business welfare , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
to promote new thor@@ ough and promote reforms , new moment@@ um and vitality will cause growth and offer new opportunities for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list on regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls , promoting state control ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the inhabitants of the population .
after the statement , a negative list will be created , sectors and companies that do not enter the investment .
the system is being tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance since the market has a major role in the allocation of resources , a legally binding business field guarantees and the market open , the statement said .
the government will also ease insp@@ ections on the companies that are transferred to companies , and that companies will decide how to carry out their businesses .
the statement also said that China will permit the border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
under an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas will be opened for private investment .
&quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investment and will provide the legitim@@ ate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and bring better services to them , &quot; said the statement .
furthermore , it is easier for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by facil@@ it@@ ating the requirements and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader of Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in one after the meeting .
EU wants to double its limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in big car@@ cases and to consumers a significantly higher dose of ne@@ ural cre@@ ations .
the consumer advoc@@ acy F@@ ood@@ watch , who prepar@@ es an appropriate employer for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for risks and adverse events , with full impact on pregnant women and young children , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have increased the limit values for large fish at the end of the food chain like Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; of one to two milli@@ grams of mercury .
however large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly alig@@ ned with mercury , that on the basis of currently applicable limits can not be sold about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only a 14.@@ 5 percent would be sale .
in contrast to that attrac@@ ting , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limits on other fish &apos;s limits on other fish of 0.5 mg to 0,1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch describes this but as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ etary of fish , such as car@@ p usually so low so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
therefore , Wolf@@ sch@@ midt has declared the lowering of the eff@@ ec@@ tivity in Kl@@ einf@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal , which is strongly stim@@ ulated by the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; low amounts may already cause serious damage to the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment explains its homepage with regard to current estimates , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; is not expected .
mercury in particular , through the coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information report by the Federal Ministry of Environmental Policy , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ eb@@ re ordered more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total population em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish is approximately in El@@ be , Rhine , and Danube , &quot; permanently and so @-@ ending , &quot; Spiegel had quoted &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March of paper .
last year , war@@ nings against mercury in fish have already been reported to the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
