Obama welcomes Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not really friendly .
they wanted to deal with the implementation of international agreement as well as on Teheran to dest@@ abil@@ ise measures in the Middle East .
he is also said to have a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious since years .
Washington crit@@ ici@@ zes the constant settlement of Israel and is turning to the peace process in the peace process .
through Obama &apos;s deal in deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was classified as an affair against Obama .
the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting was imp@@ lied with an indication of the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call he conf@@ esses professor , shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon admir@@ ers with a sc@@ ary voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb &apos;s important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably alive , and he said that the family @-@ contact of the dead lady could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house the officials found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note that was cra@@ cked on a white blo@@ c : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot; this was signed after the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , who set up in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already set up 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed by police according to the police , he was shot dead and killed by police .
Delta State University Poli@@ gra@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the Department of Ophthalmology belongs to the shooting of 10 : 18 h .
he said that lamb had made the fatal emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police viol@@ ated him .
a day after shooting in the University , the students and lecturer , forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still trying to proc@@ ure a picture of what is moti@@ ved .
the details of the investigations involved in both parts of the state were published , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped me to draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teachers .
students say that they are looking forward to his teaching .
the police at G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself mentioned such a book from Lamb , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he gave his academic life .
both sub@@ structures in the Department of Social Sciences and History , comprising 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations regarding problem@@ atic attitude .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ efs , praised the Lamb , said he was too excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem to any health problem .
this year , he spent just two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university shows that the promotion , for the Lamb , had worked so hard for him , would be no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Assistant Professor .
the University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
these are questions that the Lamb is not able to answer .
after the escape from the campus , police found Lam@@ bs track later , when he joined Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , he was self @-@ cured by a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber @-@ gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents in the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Bre@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in return .
it was not immediately clear why they went to this house , but Johnson said that it knew he knew people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , who has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12,000 inhabitants , and he taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he earned his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long@@ standing friends of the friends drew him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together .
they and their friends were at High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach you the guitar game .
he was then the s@@ warm of women .
all girls have melted away when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don .
lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss were apparently some time together .
in the emergency call he said : &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ab@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
she and her mom were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met suit , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ ab@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both three years ago in a summer @-@ year @-@ old .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ is@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes party coordinator at the Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a faint lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he was lamb and Pr@@ ab@@ iss Night in the night 5 . September for the last time he had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a lucky couple , &quot; he said .
we were living and h@@ itting together .
I mean they both had a good sense for jo@@ king .
Schmidt , the dead Professor , led the first semester of the seminar and specialised in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , where he was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the Church at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemorative ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial @-@ watch while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the course will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this history was corrected to reflect that the police had now said that lamb had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb had been written in his emergency call Pr@@ ab@@ iss as his wife , but there was no indication of that both boys have ever been married .

she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it will be obvious to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

8 survey values , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is seriously treated .
some have attempted to turn him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how several rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper kn@@ uck@@ les at the p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in a double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ized that Rick Per@@ cent &apos;s leadership in the rising of Herman Cain was in 2011 , of which no one won only a state in the nomin@@ ating process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside kno@@ ck@@ ups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps Power @-@ fortune and start to run their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey figures suggest@@ ing that the real estate is not only a temporary stage is :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy middle of June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
around three out of ten that they have a negative belief .
and these figures are in early States .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa , last week found that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters were happy with ro@@ gue as candidates .
in a CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump would have been nominated .
only two of 10 say they would have &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if he was a candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , which would say the same about ro@@ gue ) .
the next things in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were &quot; uns@@ elling &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans sees tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the voters think that the real estate Mog@@ ul is the correct temper@@ ament for a president , thus ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first sel@@ ective state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality of a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his function effectively , and almost six out of 10 independent people say his temper@@ ament is not the White House , as ABC / post .
Republican voters reas@@ oned to the idea .
when setting up their hon@@ our@@ able , republi@@ can voters are real .
when they are asked , who wins the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee , say after a survey of CNN / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump would be the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four of the ten end of July got their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans were that Rick Per@@ ry win nom@@ ination would win with only 28 % for the final candidates of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters will look as plau@@ sible campaign .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still running almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fra@@ gment field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ us .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between tro@@ op and most other republi@@ can candidates , ump @-@ stit@@ ches .
he studied in front of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally at margin Paul , John Kas@@ i and Chris Christie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans , that they formed their opinion .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who will assist , say that they have set their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters think they have imag@@ ined their opinion is twice as common for ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ ded with ump in immigration on the subject of immigration .
since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his campaign was named after two months of immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; was the immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic extin@@ ction of tro@@ mp@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will be re@@ mot@@ ely controlled by the Republican Party and will damage the re @-@ oriented effort .
but after the new ABC / post survey conducted by Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ ded with ump in asking questions of immigration .
as long as immigration falling in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump appears to do too .
the fru@@ stration about the government climbed to new high@@ s .
against Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of Republican @-@ elec@@ tors , mainly through its out@@ si@@ der status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ noon @-@ survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey carried out by Des Mo@@ ines regi@@ sters / Bloomberg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago that three out of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , at 54 percent , &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ al . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the hob@@ oo@@ king way is the most expensive cat @-@ residence - with views of the North Sea att .
in the street there will cost one square meter of a home @-@ house with an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; in Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it is said in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows , in which particular areas will cost a square meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really small .
unlike Germany &apos;s top resorts , one of the price varies , however , like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has launched a ranking of exclusive German residential sites - with a square meter guarantee at dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several ten@@ ths of a thousand Euro nix - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception here at the top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ way go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky shot by Thomas Müller made the way to FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions @-@ League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario I@@ dol presented a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; by FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ ean matches ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th strong success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to finally collect the H@@ enk@@ el@@ ote to Munich on the third party .
Müller was sent by the champ@@ ions of the champ@@ ions in the champ@@ ions in the champ@@ ions in the Champions League , Chief of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who were going to pass one as a f@@ lange remembered the World Champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; said Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 3@@ 88 au@@ ditions - and the Munich @-@ based word kept word .
they showed focused and dedicated , without sh@@ re@@ aking .
Pi@@ raeus had the youngest six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , including against renowned clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) emigrated here .
however , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , the Bayern Munich doesn &apos;t want to be the next sacrifice .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their adv@@ ent efforts but often to inv@@ ent works .
the attacks were often led to often by a bac@@ kl@@ ash on the steering position of Douglas Costa , which was rare with the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had pulled from the right more fortunate than his flan@@ k from the right hemisphere in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion scored the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski &apos;s best occasions in one half of one .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown , defeated the head of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then , on direct purchase , the keeper Roberto with the knee are par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5th ) .
even though the Bayern had moved their fully domin@@ ate game , he was able to place Pi@@ raeus &apos;s con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous .
to Tor@@ que Manuel New@@ man there was news .
so , when he direc@@ ts a shot of ide@@ ye via the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to that , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola arrested a four @-@ qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba on the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Go@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ es , sat outside .
the World Cup hero was given green light only after the final training , said sports managers Matthias Sam@@ mers at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different , that &apos;s already evil . &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to wait against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the mist@@ ress of Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
the Go@@ ddess arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller another one .
in front of the game , it had come to the stadium in Kra@@ v@@ all .
after having prov@@ oked a smaller group of mu@@ til@@ ted Bavaria fans in their audience block , the supporters of the host Pi@@ raeus argu@@ ed with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went up against the Munich supporters .
at least a Bayern fan has been injured in the stadium .
those who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smo@@ kes , thus spar@@ es not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this puts a long @-@ term study close .
the good news : with ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smoking has got a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non smoking visitors the risk of losing their teeth was considerably reduced by 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ feet higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
major causes for dental treatment are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum tissue , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphas@@ izes .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to frequent g@@ ing@@ iv@@ itis in smokers .
if it is not clari@@ fied , smoking is also increasing the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking by smoking might reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endang@@ ering back to the level of non smoking , the first aut@@ or Thomas Dietrich , also declared the English University of Birmingham .
one should convince humans , non @-@ smokers , &quot; stated teachers H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot;
smoking is good for lung and j@@ ars and leads to our knowledge of good dental health to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of un@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided it .
previous studies have already noted that smoking would increase the risk of early dental damage .
the new long @-@ term study is Moor@@ ish the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the Rhein@@ gau Rhein@@ u@@ fers of Cologne from the late anti@@ quity
finally , at the right Rhine river Rhine , Cologne has been closed down for the repeated time .
in the proximity of the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , ar@@ che@@ ologists have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the Rhine @-@ construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called &quot; floor monuments . &quot;
in all construc@@ ting buildings in Cologne , the museum will always be added as a Department of National Archae@@ ological Heritage .
the ar@@ che@@ ologists were now found in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ards .
from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained by Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs , which was probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over TT@@ IP
the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ing System for the planned trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP .
the controversial private cru@@ ises for disp@@ utes between the concert and states are to be replaced by a transparent system that is clearly more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; we want to agree with a system that trust the citizens , &quot; stated by Commissioner Malm@@ ström &apos;s Commissioner Malm@@ ström .
the Swe@@ d@@ din has proposed the proposal to negoti@@ ate the European negoti@@ ating leadership in the United States as a European negoti@@ ating position .
the German Government announced assistance .
the TT@@ IP will be the largest Free Trade Zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration procedure accurately predic@@ t that the EU states and the United States have shared independent judges as a new investment in the United States .
they are expected to come to the same parts from the EU , the USA and third countries .
for the first time , there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to elev@@ ate against the jud@@ gements .
so far , the trial involved ensu@@ ed together on arbit@@ rators , a claim against their judgments , did not exist .
in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizen of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström won .
in the long term , it aims to work according to an international investment court .
there , for example , disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investment in particular of major concer@@ ting schemes ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ers are crit@@ ici@@ zed by enemies as a type of parallel , for the companies of compensation for tax@@ pay@@ ers the tax@@ pay@@ ers have to under@@ take national laws or to drop off reducing consumer and environmental standards .
in the first reports , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations like Camp@@ act registered the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ adequate .
the crit@@ ici@@ zes for the non @-@ negotiated free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) is crit@@ ici@@ zed .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mak@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , called the plans for great progress .
when considering the reform , the Commission &apos;s involvement has dra@@ fted essential points , by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring .
the old system of private parties would be taken by the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Association of Busin@@ ess@@ Europe warned against numerous new rules to restri@@ ct participation in economy by too many new rules .
some small and medium @-@ sized enterprises may be dis@@ advant@@ aged thereby , as the result was .
when the talks about the TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreements can be concluded , continued un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
although investing in investment protection has not been discussed with the United States .
originally you should have a frame for the agreement at the end of this year .
the date is not valid until now .
delicious Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
even 11 years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sat on the stage in Cologne &apos;s Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ pchart , which is recorded on the shy of the picturesque US state of Michigan where recorded felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ously and z@@ art arranged songs .

it is the rum@@ our that &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a series of clubs : each of the 50 U.S. states in a row would be discussed .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ ster &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ ster is anticip@@ ating the tension of the Prime Minister since its election in 2009 .
the new Labour MEP Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and setting David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is to rise shortly after noon , in order to face the first of his six given questions , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour MPs from the vicinity .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he can ski@@ p some sessions to leave their colleagues .
the encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , since it comes to a member of the shadow of the shadow and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision was prov@@ oked in silence during the victory celebrations for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS , and stands at the centre of several cover pages about newspapers .
Mr Ho@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to do not sing the national hy@@ mn , has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night Programme , he advised the Labour Party to sing the national hy@@ mn , &quot; independent of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of sha@@ dows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns top team and it &apos;s been called on differences between economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party supported him as a leader .
the BBC correspon@@ dent in BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be in the Labour &quot; st@@ acking , &quot; following Mr Cor@@ ster &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference to make Labour changes to limit the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labor and pensions , said the party &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the ruling plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , the David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the course of the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament .
the Labour MEP , promised another political leader , says he gave &quot; Crow@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions concerning Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime time of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front@@ ally , and that it has under@@ gone both &quot; perc@@ ep@@ it@@ fulness , &quot; and the dispute with obstacles , has to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the sha@@ dows of economic ministers will represent him when he is not participating - for example , when Mr. Cameron is abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues drew on the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ man , the spokesperson of the basement , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove himself from politics to the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; who often is linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aires . however , a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
when they first aired on TV in 1990 , the fre@@ ed@@ oms with the Prime Minister received a leader of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position under his parliamentary report , although critics have argu@@ ed that they had become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms .

both of them - and in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ al owner , Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together into a sk@@ ewer .

Met@@ cash starts Land @-@ Rem@@ uner@@ ation Camp@@ aign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In Case
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A branches off a Al@@ di @-@ Ass@@ assin@@ ation in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ ers started a scale campaign campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run of a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ re &amp; IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A by ma@@ instream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adelaide .
IG@@ A deal@@ er@@ ship and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as iron pilot Simm@@ o from D@@ ice borough , distributed in IG@@ A stores and sell shares of shop that sell total tickets for the South Australian football League to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish a further details of his defense strategy on 29 September when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices will carry out its annual investors strategy .
there is a lot on the game that South Australia and Western Australia covers nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop @-@ shops , and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial Provin@@ cial and IG@@ A negoti@@ ators have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to some 14 percent in Western Australia .
analysts believe that Al@@ di will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries for the opening of his first markets in these two countries and will take advantage of all existing actors , but primarily independent single @-@ tra@@ ders .
according to a report published in this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley perceived that IG@@ A @-@ reta@@ iler could lose $ 360 million a year and in a cash balance of $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di was in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
due to the loss of food and gro@@ c@@ eries and market at high level Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , Met@@ cash could cost approximately 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ re loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l of Roy Morgan was out that IG@@ A @-@ purch@@ aser turned out to be the most likely .
Morgan Stanley assumed that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce its market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was in Melbourne wearing a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ could probably will disappear within a decade .
obviously , they refused to respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it assumes that a board member has made contact by Mr Dou@@ glass with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Shops , which has dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , has dropped by 43 percent , which reflects the operating debt reduction on turnover and mar@@ gins .
however , whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers are v@@ ener@@ ated , however , investing more than $ 150 million to increase sales prices with hundreds of products each week and IG@@ A @-@ individual tra@@ ders to improve their shops due to growing fresh foods and provide a better variety of private @-@ label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging program of Elan will become , hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis company Steve He@@ aly ,
Than@@ asi Coc@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserve praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Than@@ ksgiving Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise from the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly rather praise than criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , called again the &quot; Special KS &quot; , got into the lim@@ mer@@ sible argument from Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters on the lim@@ el@@ ight .
in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinnati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent had to go separated from the refer@@ ee that Harrison called : &quot; AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to suggest that Cy@@ gios . I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen , as he crushed a tennis ra@@ cket , a Kr@@ amp@@ f ble@@ w a potential US Open win by Richard Gas@@ quet , def@@ ends from He@@ aly , def@@ lec@@ tic .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth to second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I en@@ viable , is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little bit isolated in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket made of fru@@ stration with itself , and I know Than@@ ksgiving a good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he did behave extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances of Harrison and so forth , and I think he deserves many recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I believe he was a little to be treated .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he is doing a problem with the other players he is trained in the changing area , he is a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged based on his own ad@@ missions .
He@@ aly also supported the decision , Cy@@ gios works at the important decision making , which kicks off on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; than the right for everyone , but he backs up the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long lasting strong component . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ versy over around &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick has made quite quick the rise of what people like Feder@@ er and Murray have mentioned . he is rising in the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , but we try to give him the consequences of his trading post , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , resi@@ sts refugees
Hungary explains the emergency stand and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and kept all who tried to come illegal in the country . everything with the goal to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the fron@@ tier , as hundreds of migrants react in a Ni@@ em@@ ab@@ s@@ land and Serbian civil servants responded by indig@@ nation .
the people who were before violence fled , a@@ woke to an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built up tents , and settled there .
but fruit increased .
when a police helicopter ho@@ unded over them , the migrants &apos; opening the border ! &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian distribution Police .
some referred back from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable , &quot; that migrants would be sent from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
in the coming days , talks with Brussels and other countries have to be held , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ AC@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ences on Hungarian @-@ Serb border had one day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ block at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on united immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the sw@@ apped Italy and Greece . finally , they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would gain more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary still denied its hopes for an open action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities were more powers to conquer the crisis , so that they could make roads safegu@@ ards and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is building a bar@@ bed wire through its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after the fence over the Serbian border ended .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races were deployed to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
during the past months , Hungary has become a large number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed , however , insi@@ sted that most of the future economic refugees are in search of a better life , and not war refugees , who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which emerged at midnight in Hungary are crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher terms for the traff@@ ick@@ ers of human traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; said government officials Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ers in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected to be expected next week , but reporter from Associ@@ ated Press had already seen armed forces on the border with cars and dogs already day @-@ long .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country &apos;s security adviser for Or@@ ban , said that government had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already lowered into the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are involved to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a draw@@ bridge with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders .
chaos revers@@ ed the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ zing an crowd around .
about 20 succeeded to get caught , but thousands stayed outside .
a further group of migrants are blocking the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would spend food and water until they are travelling to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead to Bern@@ ie S@@ anders
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the Democratic race for nomin@@ ating national level , but sen@@ ator Bern@@ ie S@@ another wins opposite to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters among the elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase of 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not announced his presidential election , receives support of 15 per cent of democratic electoral elections .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary elections , the majority of democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion exists , which candidates can support them .
but Clin@@ ics supporters are more resistant than the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while others achieved a number of profits .
Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have decreased .
her support for the men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is just 5 points behind .
Clin@@ ics benefit with democratic voters under 50 years has pl@@ ung@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton thus has a big lead over the older voters .
last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit margin with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders is now a 5 point advantage in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters expect that they were supposed to support Clinton with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the Party .
one quarter would support it with some but 15 percent would only support them because they &apos;re the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ ics current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger in those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters do this over their peak season don@@ or Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
when Clin@@ ft supporters can be asked in an open question , the most common response is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time for a woman &apos;s president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
from Clin@@ ft supporters , Bill Clinton is also mentioned in their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and the voters are also quoted .
since the vice @-@ president th@@ rows the potential for the Presi@@ dential office in the orph@@ an@@ age , 57 percent of democratic @-@ voters want to see him in the races , even though a third has believed that he should not do it .
if Democratic voters are asked by the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
by Clin@@ ics att@@ ach@@ ments say more than half that bi@@ den would make their second choice far ahead .
decides to de@@ code bi@@ ds not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton thus increases his score from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race for 30 points without him in the race .
thirty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning this election , but this figure dropped from 78 percent last month .
bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage he who sees him as the &quot; choice &quot; has risen .
nonetheless , in the question of what is more important at an candidates , Democratic voters call issues of voters .
similarly as last month , no single Democrats candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate has emerged as un@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates give good results in some important characteristics of the party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
maj@@ orities Will consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den than honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership .
in the three candidates the bi@@ ds cuts the lead with hon@@ esty , whereas Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
Democratic voters of the Presi@@ dential elections could see also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic force has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server during the term as a foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions has not influenced altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on their general opinions from Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her would have wor@@ sen@@ ed .
they are mainly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of them , who say that their views from Clinton became worse .
despite being respected by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voting rights are not holding them for honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voting rights are not more honest and un@@ honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes .
from the six different candidates bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off the best in hon@@ esty .
a majority is different , however , hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son rever@@ t at the national survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump ,
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times , behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the two candidates , half of the support of voters will be seen in the new survey , and others will lose dramatically .
Republican voters finally support tro@@ op in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News &quot; s debate in the past month , by 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son when demo@@ graphic groups arrive well and is sur@@ passed by dump in determination of Republican @-@ elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Cas@@ ich , is defeated at Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest point and dropped by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republican voters during this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son asc@@ ends to the p@@ olls - he lands on 19 % support in the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also highlighted Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
in the last week , Car@@ son asc@@ ended up some side @-@ up tro@@ ugh@@ s for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son decided to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps belief in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign presentation in I@@ owa .
pleasant pool temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean sea is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured just in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to achieve even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no longer a sea view : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are a maximum of 18 degrees , divi@@ ding the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
outdoor temperatures are still offering the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even gets up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood Society bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ings
nearly two years after a student died during an anti @-@ edge rit@@ ual of a student card in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an@@ compl@@ ain will be filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood rejected Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a period of execution as in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and had repeatedly been attacked , while he tried to push over a frozen field onto a target .
as a result , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about headache , and he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood call not calling the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s to dress his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to collect advice , said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members began to hide and comp@@ elled the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle , based on Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with a bl@@ unter strength of injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper thigh .
&quot; many families were destroyed by the victims of the Brotherhood . at least a student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , an attor@@ ney with the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
breaking fac@@ tions and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by government is very important .
in Monroe County , a County Grand Jury found an indictment of murder of third quarter for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with anti @-@ inflammatory attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ iced their belonging to the town .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a rate of interest comes , and the household is caught in bed@@ bugs , rati@@ fications for bonds , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long it will last and how long will it stop .
in particular , the history is only a small manual on the market .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve upon raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor here , as the economy and financial assets react .
as a result , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphas@@ ized that investors should not concentrate on raising its interest rate , but rather , for the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find out that the whole f@@ uss was possibly ex@@ agger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is to be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; says Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a notification to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal levels , but still at low level to lead to the seis@@ mic shock , which seem to be afraid .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a preview of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the market last month , interest rate hike can make things for quite a while .
once the increase in , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts at a recent study , resulting in the interest rate of interest by the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually recorded in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return on previous six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , boss @-@ strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank testified that the impact on the shares have been res@@ sources later on the base cycle , and the return on the margin begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but interest rate increases they promote often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed face a few conditions which had previously not existed and could accelerate a recession .
extremely interesting is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point of interest at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to German bank , 118 interest rate growth rate was only 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter following the sale of Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rate in such frag@@ ile economic setting might be ris@@ ky and tos@@ ses the question , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made a interest rate hike for the F@@ ed for the whole year , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , which ended on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could prove an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trade show only a percentage of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all the number of enhanc@@ ements from 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing moment@@ um in GDP , and rec@@ er@@ ated before rec@@ essions in sha@@ dows after beginning of recovery . &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed stage .
the current cycle was by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , as the market im@@ planted a interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds in bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle would occur .
at the end of the rental course , lawyers arrive immediately , the Deutsche Bank told .
the str@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to lower back and shorter bonds between extended and shorter bonds .
high @-@ rate bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analysts at Schw@@ ab , said in an analysis .
interesting is , Jones said that the markets have already adapted itself to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the view of higher monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit ten@@ sion@@ ism has increased , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole , businesses that rep@@ licate the larger part of their business activities in the USA , benef@@ iting from interest rates and will be attractive local products .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse , as a proportion of dollars makes their products on the global market more expensive and as well as financing their debt .
&quot; history proves that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ analysts in a report to the customers .
with a strong balance sheet , companies with a weak account after each of the interest rate in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 aver@@ aged an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital contributions as well as low vol@@ atility of their shares also sur@@ passed their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers will also benefit from increasing dollars outside the consumer games .
as@@ ers can see gains by higher yields , even if experts in different opinion , how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliamentary member Andrew B@@ ingham
as a parliament member , the parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he would not be increasingly to distinguish dly from commercial Riv@@ age .
he was also referring to the BBC Music Awards and said that she only cited The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dami@@ en Collins The program The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts to &quot; Classic FM , &quot; says a leading parliamentary resolution and raises new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something for the private television .
the Conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham said to have said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ caster radio station &quot; ev@@ apor@@ ates &quot; and increasingly to be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I &apos;m using the word &quot; Dam@@ age@@ ous , &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also attended the BBC Music Awards , which started in December .
the BBC Music Awards , starting in the past year , seems to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spont@@ aneously named examples , in which you actually only know what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
the BBC @-@ General Director proved the accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that the BBC Radio 3 went far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and clari@@ fication of the public .
what I learn from radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and to give new works on behalf of Radio 3 , new music and new works , I think also really important , &quot; he said .
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tough@@ er should be engaged to engage in the audience as it did in the past because the British are less about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element in BBC production that during the hearing in the Committee for selecting Culture , Media and Sport , under fire , could enter the commercial Riv@@ age into your feet .
the T@@ ory of Dami@@ en Collins The Voice On - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC was created 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge &quot; in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
he added , he wishes to find the company &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when it starts a entertainment series next time .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order of other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money from the commission pay@@ ers for different entertainment formats .
Internet sales up in August at slow@@ est speed and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales reinforced 3 years ago by using mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down in November
for more than a decade , the virtual shopping in Britain has tow@@ ed , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have transformed into ho@@ stages .
however , experts say that there are now signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and going back to 2000 , this has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G Sales Company to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales made three years ago , when buyers were starting to make purchases in their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from the United States , is being cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that purch@@ aser will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on Friday , November last Friday .
last year , 5 times the average number of buyers around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers websites dis@@ counted off .
experts believe that Black Friday , at whom the buyer could stick for sn@@ u@@ pp@@ ets , buyers who could stop doing shopping .
a study by British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washers , more than one @-@ third of the shopping is now being carried out by web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of the people dress clothes and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the inner corners .
Muslims : Muslims in M@@ ec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family will be sanc@@ tioned in
the bodies of 29 dead bodies are attributed to Muslims in the first bur@@ ial of M@@ ec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia determines the break down of the huge Saudi @-@ bin Laden in the last
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed .
hundreds of Muslims were gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried out by the streets to bury the dead which were killed when a crane collapsed in M@@ ec@@ ca &apos;s large mosque .
filled in white , largely white , the circuit in order to classi@@ fy their respect , when the first of the dead came on their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ aissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the tragedy will pass on the Holy Sites , where only days earlier a building crane collapsed by the ceiling of the mosque and then thrown onto the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi King over the construction companies of the bin Laden &apos;s construction contrac@@ ted because of the catastrophe which also left 3@@ 94 publishers .
the bodies of 29 bet@@ s killed when a crane collapsed by the big central Mos@@ h@@ ort m@@ ec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
under the dead Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram made from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgri@@ mage , the crane collapsed when the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the yearly walk in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the p@@ add@@ ich will continue to M@@ ec@@ ca with thousands , which will continue to come to the city .
today , king Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , could not stand the arm of the dragon when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree pro@@ mul@@ gated by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English service agency does not reported this detail , but said that foreign business leaders are forbidden to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was revealed to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , pl@@ ung@@ ed into a court of large mos@@ h@@ ort , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims come in front of the p@@ add@@ tl , which eventually took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree ad@@ ored the group due to non @-@ current safety measures and because it does not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes encomp@@ assed M@@ ec@@ ca ra@@ ping rather than part of the massive construction project , managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia &apos;s master family for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
al @-@ Qaeda &apos;s de@@ ceased leader , Osama bin Laden , was a farewell son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in 1990 .
the crash of the crane arrived in the middle of a strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgri@@ mage , which is at least once a life of every healthy individual .
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government representatives showed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to the victims of the victims , plus the same sum to permanent injuries .
other injured will get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the period of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British employ more and more craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe has an increase behind him
this leads to a fact that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ it stores , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q net sales are close nationwide .
Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favour of the use of qualified native @-@ European handic@@ ra@@ fts , which perform work in their home .
if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you may belong to a minority nowadays .
for the British , British employ more and more craftsmen to carry home @-@ workers jobs in their homes , as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who has the tree @-@ powered chain , said that a large rise in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to deep enthusiasm throughout the meantime .
as a consequence , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ ovens shops which join art@@ is@@ ans and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , since eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment , the men were silent .
she said that it is necessary to exhibit the growing demo@@ graphic trends which feature more female single households which have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry stated : &quot; there still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who , one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , is one of the leading companies involved in reflecting the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that holds exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its Managing Director and CFO .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry stated : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .

because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q will open 200 new branches .
function of a@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
in the state of Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner a@@ I / DO@@ B have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ c@@ ence .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation written in May .
the current trial was post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , Robert Ri@@ ffel were cryst@@ all@@ ised in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 have allowed funds to disp@@ ose over them in their features allowed for private purposes .
the damage controller comes with approximately 400,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged for financial sources .
the priesthood was the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ner District , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a future date .
referring to the dis@@ advantages of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence counsel was that no one at the time had an asset to the association .
Sports officials employed only up@@ loading and the sports club , which they had held from 1982 to 2011 , in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt , passi@@ on@@ ated in 2001 were approximately 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( roughly 4@@ 4,000 Euros ) in the year 2001 .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we carry the club further or lock up ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial officer .
with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have shot money , our life insur@@ ers as security in the Bank , &quot; he said during the arrest .
by the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , no debt is allowed to be made .
nonetheless , the withdrawal of the allowance was made retro@@ spec@@ tively by the end of 1991 .
therefore I have paid a part of the recording costs only years later , namely as a plus on the account has been paid out .
this is why the l@@ ump and non @-@ det@@ rac@@ tions seemed to be explained in detail , the former ob@@ mann covered the proceedings .
the two def@@ endants over@@ turned the accused , and the second accused began .
why the withdrawal of the club was not yet revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not interested in detail on the financial dispos@@ ition , important to have been only the debt of debt as the answer .
in 2011 , when conducting investigations into account of office ab@@ using , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the United Kingdom &apos;s account .
that had been retro@@ sp@@ ect , the def@@ endants over@@ turned .
this securities account ran on the behalf of the accused and was not known to the association , according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent did not know a response .
then he thought , he believed that it was the best for the association .
if something happened to him would have played something from that money , the prosecutor asked the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed of all , just@@ i@@ fying the function .
this transaction was form@@ ulated as &quot; compens@@ atory restoration . &quot;
why someone claims ? , we wanted to know judge and attor@@ ney .
there@@ on , the first def@@ endant pleaded , that it was not understood with this formulation because it had never been caused by the association .
but what shall I do if the lawyer tells us , &quot; You are all of you . &quot;
&quot; I am a representative for me ? &quot; he asked .
moreover , the func@@ tionary he said that he has never engaged a cent of content , he reck@@ ons only kilometres of money and di@@ ets .
as a di@@ ets he added a bill of € 1,000 per month , but the actual effort was much higher , added .
exact documents for the early years could not indic@@ t the accused .
these may be judged based on an operating test , in which everything has been evaluated correctly , no longer kept , declared them .
the second employee was also included .
in cash , all containers exist in cash and have to leave the Bank from his home to the Bank of Rem@@ burg , stated in his statement .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and head@@ lamps for several hundred million refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ish@@ ky correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the demol@@ ition of the counter @-@ control point .
he said by phone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the police officers the water was ready .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw themselves with stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials made a previously un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ting pep@@ per@@ mint spray .
afterwards the police used tear gas .
much lac@@ ri@@ val@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was then dis@@ band@@ ed .
the refugees now have been waiting for themselves .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
the children who were inhal@@ ed , cried out .
other refugees jack@@ ed together and s@@ led under breathing .
the press secretary of the Serbian police were also subjected to injuries through the use of lac@@ ri@@ gr@@ as and pep@@ per@@ mint spray .
time of decision on interest rates for US bank@@ note bank
the world ob@@ serves if the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday that comes together to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who have been questioned by Reuters , found that the F@@ ed would do this last week that the F@@ ed will do this now , now that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will hold .
it is a historic event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est lowered to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Head associate at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rough outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets , facing each one , but the signs indicate that the chances are good against such a step .
the decision is expected to be announced by 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death cover at Delta State University , left un@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zing
after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he subsequently killed his colleague and killed , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say &quot; I do &quot; with the first murder and , &quot; he could make it un@@ seen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the c@@ auti@@ er police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social education at the Delta State University , ph@@ oned the emergency number at 10 : 00 PM on Monday morning .
and said he shot upon someone , and someone killed .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency that the police had to leave police officers at his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; and he also noted that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , but he could not distur@@ b &quot; no one , but it will probably be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted it to reverse it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing , I took 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed by E@@ than Schmidt , a Professor of History , killing her his own life on Monday evening when police murdered him on Monday .
the University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot;
despite reports on Monday that lamb had said that it had also been a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ abh@@ or was born by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ abh@@ or had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that she had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , under the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Pr@@ ab@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that she had a dog named Light@@ ning , who hit him with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
the police said that lamb came up at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; he was not in prison . &quot;
when police ch@@ ased him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran in the woods and killing herself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctorate label from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , how his life raft at the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ ros@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large Group structure .
just half a billion euros per year wants to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace for the workplace .
in the pilot licence , there are in@@ ert to the new negotiations .
Lufthansa builds up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cost @-@ cheaper Eu@@ ros@@ ings .
the establishment of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of about 500 million euros per year of cost and reduction syn@@ ergi@@ es , acknowledged the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not provide a executive board for passenger transport in the future .
the low cost airline Eu@@ ros@@ ings should be as pec@@ uli@@ ar as possible .
Karl Ulrich pra@@ ises will be responsible for the team of Eu@@ ros@@ is by managing director Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the re@@ design , Sp@@ oh@@ r highlights the importance of Eu@@ ros@@ ci@@ ence with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
under the name of the Air@@ line Group , airline companies operated three quarters of the 2012 annual revenue of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective agreement with the pilot licence ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the prosec@@ uted man@@ ned strike on Thursday .
the union took part in this area .
theme of talks will be the silence @-@ control for pilots .
in a year with the projected record result , cockpit was to come with a projected record result .
the conflict between Trade and Air@@ line led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the trans@@ itional provision of the pilots , the austerity concept &quot; Wings . &quot;

no . Luke Shaw from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months for dou@@ bling fre@@ ading
Luke Shaw suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right B@@ one at the Champions @-@ League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while speaking with the left foreign champ@@ ions and ending it for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal saw the hope that Shaw is playing again in this season .
the injury was caused by a promising attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year @-@ old Shaw in the PS@@ V segment was broken .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg infrastructure and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later , and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United . it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the dressing room , he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have double fac@@ tions , it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have a red card and a displacement of a mo@@ ist .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ se the Mexican .
van G@@ aal suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mist@@ aken .
you can judge for themselves , when I say there was a penalty of eleven and a red card .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account reads : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back on again . &quot;
a relation of this : Manchester United had the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England @-@ def@@ ender has an additional incenti@@ ve for the European Championship in France , to recover from the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves this type of breaking down the square , everyone is very sad .
it never is the intention of our player to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a char@@ me when Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; it &apos;s very hard because it &apos;s not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , this isn &apos;t good , &quot; says Coc@@ o .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who had been travelling to another direction , so it looked at as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
talk with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad . I feel so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was captured in hospital - following a ch@@ oul@@ iti@@ ze by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book it will not last long until you know it almost .
whether it &apos;s more , you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book decided , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax he decided in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to have a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead of giving a summary of the film version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , met the girl of his dreams by telling her desire to see a real tree , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , died and who died in 1991 but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ ici@@ ously enough : the text of Cameron becomes part of how the summary of the Lord movie Database , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , hopes that a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is preten@@ ding to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron is making the action of the book so little familiar . here , a dis@@ named boy , like the local environment , dist@@ orted , despite the protests of the renowned Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , sn@@ ur@@ gy creature that speaks on the name of trees . &quot;
most likely , a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to an assistant who gave the Lor@@ ax a child for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokesperson said that the text might probably be heard by the Cam@@ er@@ ons election agency .
Super camps affir@@ med that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons delivered staff , but there was no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
to rep@@ el in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one has selected the Ka@@ es , the UK for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat is not on my map .
I would not ex@@ ert a down@@ fall .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ ing @-@ list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry any s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive approach .
with the ball , Mo@@ en@@ Ali develops as a spin @-@ kno@@ b and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid with the ball , even when he represents an unknown on a test level , is an option for the attack .
the news : Adam Ly@@ th schei@@ d out of the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and will be replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , to analyse as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks using difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that thr@@ ck@@ et@@ ers are looking at results .
there was no question mark in Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ee , here - and I said this to them - players have their own best choosing .
a long time ago , it had been extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny .
he hopefully sm@@ ashed another study for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not have such good performances , and I did not surprise me ; he is a team man .
the question , how much time a test winner receives , in order to set his character is difficult .
he received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him , while Nick joined Comp@@ ton nine .
only Comp@@ ton came the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that you could rise was that England first sat down in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in high shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a drummer who I am highly ad@@ mi@@ red .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ Player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he achieved room on a Tr@@ ent Bridge room , which met us very much .
he must , at least , have at least the same chances of getting before him , but this depends , of course , from the competitive position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ as next to Cook , which would receive an extra spin @-@ spin and four qu@@ icks , I di@@ ps up , and I did nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz can &apos;t beat there , and this left handed left has already shown that he is a devil or cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een does not handle his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but it &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he ran as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he did just three hundred favor@@ ites right away and looked not back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is coming in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people possibly can see his st@@ ats - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup co@@ ach@@ ers who lift their hands and the coach made themselves for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
besides the crew , England has made a few smart g@@ ad@@ ditions at train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ate , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the tests could be a master coup .
he is one of the most kin@@ dest guy of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played among all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and powerful action into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh wind into the dressing cabin , even when the messages appear in line with before .
Coll@@ y &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the one @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coding and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as with players , their jobs depends on the results .
such decisions are not being made easy in heart .
Bre@@ xit Stock ( Bre@@ xit = the Great Britain out of the EU ) could push for Zul@@ u when the economy is in a Fl@@ au@@ te until 2017 .
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ issued new e@@ quest@@ rian strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble by every day , even without the election of the gen@@ ious Jerem@@ y , &quot; Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , cont@@ ested against Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their cor@@ ns and Ni@@ gel colors .
a European diplom@@ acy acknowle@@ dges that some member states , as deeply wor@@ shi@@ ed in various crises such as the EU is now and not always drawn from their own fault , Britain himself , and dis@@ rupted the changes they did not want , satisfied .
in Brighton , TU@@ C is in charge of its annual meeting that it also does not like to end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance ministers report on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a picture of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants to leave Britain out in the inside of the EU @-@ Ze@@ tes - &quot; Leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can see that more and more short @-@ supervised ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them as it looks terrible for it as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a b@@ ass@@ ent force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist government , Spain a left hand .
it is hard to imagine that they are imag@@ ined a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Br@@ its , whose energy should be better to prevent from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of them have separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies .
hence , some such ministers also plan without any help , quite in the SN@@ P style , whereas UK &apos;s adviser in 2017 to speed up a Bre@@ xit process will probably susp@@ ect my friend .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; and &quot; Britain has won anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how rough the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press file , as did not have been supported by our admission in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can recall that they were weak in Boris Johnson , who could remember the ore @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as &quot; EU @-@ friendly ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his pro@@ lon@@ ge@@ vity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
in addition , the med@@ ley of steering wheel ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone boo@@ sting foreigners and pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ countries have belonged to most of our large newspapers .
in fact Tony Bla@@ ir was similar to her , but noted that if one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;ll get better ban@@ anas to handle it , rather than for lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band had been more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed the report of Cam@@ er@@ ons refer@@ end@@ os@@ cop@@ es , since Bla@@ ir had refused the principle of the un@@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was turned down by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back@@ door .
the press never sp@@ ans him out .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - seems to be repeated in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott , Mur@@ doch &apos;s boy@@ cott of the age of 80 .
it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ mission &apos;s official position to Europe is - I &apos;ll press it a time - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ ant and the wild batt@@ ali@@ es of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism probably can say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite named &quot; Ben@@ n &quot; said in the radio and on TV this week did not admit that Cor@@ pus &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor was a poor idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &quot; s when his old father worked on TV about his endeav@@ or to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight , to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said about what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said about what J@@ C tells his fellow men and MPs after all reports on their cl@@ auses during Monday evening .
whatever the right Bot@@ tom @-@ Up image from Cor@@ di@@ n wants to im@@ press - think that he even cleared me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding area of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct , Cameron doesn &apos;t provide free ticket to Europe who allowed him to keep lab@@ ours help in the campaign campaign for granted titles as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks of this .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns are fundamental pl@@ am@@ ities to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past , and not only a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion on the left dis@@ sidents who is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ ate proves that J@@ C will not start a campaign for exit - become foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find in all a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin use political capital - they have also mis@@ erable voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if it can be meaning@@ less ?

experts critic@@ ise report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a government sponsored agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful to smoking in a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) wrote Lanc@@ et to crit@@ ici@@ ze by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; full review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have asked the power handling of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in medical journal Lanc@@ et last month res@@ orted the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ate basis &quot; at which P@@ he established his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims to build up &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine , and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of its effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public anticip@@ ates that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multiple criteria ( multi @-@ critical Decision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various Nik@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was reported by British American Tob@@ acco Review ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also taught the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , said .
one of the 12 participants stated to receive funds from an E @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the financing that he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , add them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not supplied , but these include several well known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , too , the tobacco line took part from P@@ he .
the research work of the group &quot; ad@@ mits that there is a lack of &quot; heavy evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote .
however , there will be no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations made by P@@ he that &quot; there were no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being studied at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J was already re@@ acts on the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J .

P@@ he has given the clear obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what evidence of evidence and what is not , especially if there is much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people die every year at a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System £ 2 billion a year .
by clear evidence of recent evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC was to leave East@@ En@@ ders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chair@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC will stop sending programmes like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting service should only be used to make the type of programs sent not by other UK broad@@ caster .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making it public @-@ legal programs , which probably will be seen by a smaller crowd , which probably will be seen in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their rival and Sen@@ ators like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years at Channel 4 without success , to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on order or send it clearly by non @-@ subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee in the framework of his research on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep your radio fee , what I think medium or in the long term do not hold for a good idea , one should not do his production at least on programs that do not do or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a great support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show it , is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression tax rate is financed , which may also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both of both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
I stri@@ ve to see how this must be publicly @-@ judicial television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame on the hunt &quot; due to the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programs of the BBC will give back what the former Head of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture at Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC was intended to sell the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 should go where you can &apos;t measure the public , but they can accomplish their tasks , and they can be argu@@ ed when they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ urity programs that no one has seen these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs . &quot;
they lay them in a window frame , in which no one wanted to see them ever .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find an aggressive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from here .
of course , all of you think we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who &apos;s £ 150 a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ light and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday proc@@ laim@@ ing that the BBC will examine its Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said , just a little bit from the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio . and they should take part in the public broad@@ caster television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
at the issue of partner@@ ships , El@@ stein said , the BBC was supposed to do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful must be shown on TV , and with the commercial channels of Alli@@ ances , to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ ous &apos; can control brain cell by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by hat@@ ch of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment by which they have sound impul@@ ses , which have too high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard .
the impul@@ ses are working in m@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ Genetics , used by ultr@@ asound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said to the Guardian , that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , a inv@@ asive technique that ab@@ uses electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of treating symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
instead of ultr@@ am@@ ul@@ ators probably do not respond to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani determined that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bladder , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms .
the reinforced ultr@@ asonic waves function on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels , and in the membran@@ es of some of the dice cells .
the sound waves operate the opening of these ion@@ ic channels , and activate the cells they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asonic theft , Chal@@ as@@ ani is genetically modified the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ship TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels can be used .
when he turns ultr@@ asound on the changed cre@@ t@@ es , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bub@@ bles and transferred to the worms , where they switch the changed mo@@ on@@ gs .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a pioneering tool that allows researchers to put neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses in light and turn on .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ us could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be lowered to your brain &apos;s desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound tissue can hin@@ dered tissue and can be sent into the brain on top of the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student halls
eleven years ago I went as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old student of a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ale Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the cl@@ asp of those who have been sc@@ and@@ alized - and on numerous , long @-@ sigh@@ ing complaints about others .
most of all I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight easy rules .
the adv@@ ent in student halls reaches from easily ner@@ ves to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk about : people tell whence you get there and where you are from the Sabbath year , where you say &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation , helping you to find out the people who would not speak with whom you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were killed in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people get involved .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people are going to attract as well as their under@@ wear .
damp@@ ing : remember to start with a relationship with the uni @-@ relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted a rough handling of the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room B@@ umm@@ el culture that can be friendly and soci@@ ally and can bring to life @-@ long friendship .
this may be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want to continue our friendship , but you must go away so I have consumed the energy , which I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a combination of soci@@ alizing is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of a kno@@ cking .
ap@@ rop@@ os ank@@ ers : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that an un@@ sealed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with baking by baking .
as you begin at the university at the high point of forec@@ ast@@ le mania , there is nothing strange to imagine a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to cra@@ ck you . so now , please smile , if I ask you a couple of personal questions . &quot;
offer tasty treats to offer is a good way to close friends .
her ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and are perhaps to associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a permanent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep even when you &apos;re losing .
ste@@ aling the food is a common crime in student halls .
of course the cro@@ aks of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of m@@ ash for your tea ?
check this with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when cooking in inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to cope with so @-@ balanced as my co @-@ dw@@ eller who added their milk a deter@@ red agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in jail .
you should make no noise , the people can stop from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b , people are sitting in gl@@ ass@@ lands .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they make them something , Drum &amp; Bass make some qui@@ eter around , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even loud music .
when she had heard about at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours therefore had to sleep two hours before they left her own music , shut down her door and set off to her three @-@ hour exam .
would it be no romantic if your future sp@@ ouse ten@@ ded random@@ ly into the same student residence ?
the vice @-@ versa , it would not be a subsi@@ sting , if you have a fellow collector for your future sp@@ ouses to take part in her , and then they will have to see each day and perhaps learning how they bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart is his own way - but if a hot co @-@ residence definitely isn &apos;t up to your future sp@@ iny , try to in@@ compar@@ ably a little reason .
at the very exciting moment in which you notice that someone can lie his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a ultra@@ violet and mo@@ b@@ bing fine than it seems .
a good stre@@ ak is funny , but it only takes moments , until it should be a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
get a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never cut any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and place their keys into a glass of water which you then put in the freezer , but throw their poss@@ essions to the ceiling no longer than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all @-@ parties , Ger@@ ping ser@@ et@@ ants
in the central bank of the estate , Markus Gil@@ dner relies on for people who have not much money .
thus , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only attractive mother and the operator . &quot;
&apos;@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how you can build and build it well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview .
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the domestic market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner may know how soon the cheap living room can be created : it builds inside a project in terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
gent@@ lemen , many refugees are pushing for the home market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass@@ ager accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a big part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need enough room for the next decade .
a very basic , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a dog house needs the least space .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
that is different , when people under@@ war@@ n people in living blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three units , each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , with no property .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the building process lasts for six months .
that is reasonable .
do the construction manage your plans Comp@@ lic@@ ated ?
Gil@@ dner : from right , I marked my project correctly .
it always makes the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ash value special and the pitch placement .
sc@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the towns there is no place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did people react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the compet@@ itor for affordable housing ?
Mal@@ dner : true , we &apos;ve had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but luxury apartments were hardly able to afford a little more .
my project has the embassy , also the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only @-@ educated Mother or the Ger@@ ping Ear@@ ner .
I show how to build and well build today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system , when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be required by entering the setting app , &quot; General &quot; type , and then &quot; software update . &quot;
if there is ready , phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have been encountered after installation , as they receive an error message that indicates that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this can mean possibly the extin@@ ction of apps to create , but Apple has made it more likely to do this if you use a special tool , to er@@ ase apps and then re@@ install it once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the updating and is located close to a charging device , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not assume that the update will be continued , since the phone may shut down on half way and that it might result in a demol@@ ition of the updates .
read more : iOS 9 Release still on tim@@ etable despite the Wat@@ ch@@ OS delay in iOS 9 : the least exciting , but the so far best update from iOS 9 : how you can prepare for the new iPhone operating system
you should also ensure that you &apos;ve searched our chec@@ kl@@ ist to all things to help prevent things wrong and to protect themselves if it does . iOS 9 brings new functions , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new production activities for the iPad , as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system .

Dr Frank Müller takes over practice ri@@ ms and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ der@@ ausen .
furthermore , Sam@@ bur@@ sts Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economics in U@@ ta @-@ Schwart@@ z @-@ Schwart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places where the doctors are missing doctors - As@@ endorf is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller will take on the practice there on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich gives up his successor to the next few months with a half point .
after a modification phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros in the space at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y at first sight when the Fel@@ ris@@ aus@@ ens met by Frank Müller and whose wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently complet@@ es her specialist training in the Golden hospital and will also come into practice a year later .
&quot; we had always in mind that the garbage can fit perfectly in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ der@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller was pleased to pursue the idea in the future in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so one was embar@@ king on , the garbage cans bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ stage family Man Frank Müller also grew up , his medical examination in Hanover , followed up in several physician offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior doctor in Sul@@ inge , and in 2009 he was appointed chief emer@@ gen@@ cies in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is volunte@@ ered at the DR@@ K @-@ Read@@ Me@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen @-@ Competition .
starting on 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen worked as a resident , his wife in Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ stin ) is specialized in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the bin@@ ers , both intern@@ s , would like to settle down as house bodies .
thus the end@@ os@@ copy is out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms are look modern .
we will offer more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and loading EK@@ GS , and we need a private room anymore .
moreover , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro is obtained from the district administration program ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; it shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is going on , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ bur@@ sts Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients arrive in the practice of Fel@@ de@@ ausen every quarter in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another general practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at the school of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor has been found , it would have gone .
whoever visits War@@ ner &apos;s talk session , also looks especially in confi@@ dential faces : the seven medical experts appointed and the cleaning force of the rock pile .
the part@@ ing ends in As@@ endorf , at this time , after all , the medical profession had practic@@ ed for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; remembers Mu@@ ch Fel@@ der@@ ausen .
a little melanch@@ oly after the long time already .
&quot; however , we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will often see many patients often &quot; , &quot; says the intervention .
your husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I pressed me for garden work , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; said Minister for the Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel with this .
however , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an application for asylum is possible , of course , &quot; of course . &quot;
the provision and security of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
it is clear , however , that there are clear signals , &quot; the Minister said .
people must not accept that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , as well as the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia to be ref@@ using &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would leave for coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and establish some cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees as well .
similarly , this for the Minister of Ministers Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be able to monitor the surveillance of the border - mainly to Hungary .
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as an outer cap of the Schengen area .
just like the Minister of Ministers stressed , he wants to not un@@ lock the borders for refugees .
&quot; every EU member has to fill its obligations otherwise the system cannot function &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ nen Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government had ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees had already tried to travel in the night @-@ hours at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to depart for registration in Eastern Croatia .
in the near corn fields , the Croatian police were able to interv@@ ene .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles have ever been among the new refugees .
it was primarily about Sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the days ahead of his country with some 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo would have brought to the Hungarian border from Pre@@ se@@ vo , who previously fought against the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
however , the Belgrade government denied it , however , that it is to inst@@ ig@@ ated humans , certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said .
according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d during the morning , in the course of the day a further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were all night distance from the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia roughly 500 km away .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary had paid , so we told the police that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees .
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
by doing so , it could actually be in fact predic@@ table ob@@ servers of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for boundary control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ized that his country for the case of a strong energy flow from refugees have prepared appropriate plans for possible shooting situations .
he did not called details , but he pointed out that Croatia has as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; full opportunities for boundary control . &quot;
obtain strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently followed a good testimony to what concerns the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , there were still about 300 refugees after the Hungarian border crossing .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports they have spent the past night at the border crossing hor@@ g@@ os who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border check@@ points are transferred to Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g .
whether the remaining refugees are now travelling to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wednesday at a local eye @-@ stop in Hor@@ g@@ os : he stop the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed , for early .
it is currently not going to be very high refugee quot@@ ations .
it could not be said , whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
helper T migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee aid has already begun to distribute the refugees of the country , on which alternative routes across Croatia include .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border , 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still no more spacious mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine of mine had been sent near the border region .

the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical financing is available on the pass@@ ers as well as questions and discussions including the volunteer workers .
while some Pass@@ ant spontaneous the cra@@ yon , and the sentence to &quot; my life asser@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

therefore this public attitude to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to give it to the tablets , but be understand@@ able , finally , it was a very personal matter .
the death of death and dying is still in front with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although much has contributed much to the sus@@ pen@@ al movement in recent years to open the people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , revised financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the v@@ ans @-@ gig@@ ant lowered its profit outlook for a year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its transport service .
the firm also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the share posted over 2.5 percent in market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which will end in May 20 Cent less than the previous forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the smaller views may fall on average , despite the price increases , which amounts to 4.9 percent and on 4 January , despite the higher sur@@ charges for transport planes of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that it is still expected to be able to increase the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online retail .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company generates solid income in regard to economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade , with regard to global economic conditions . &quot;
plans for vac@@ ations have been announced a day later than the form of the rival UPS , which plans to set at 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as during the last year .
in the quarter of August ended August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex was $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve raised from Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts predic@@ t .
net sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the st@@ acks demanded e@@ ost@@ ations expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline of international priority shipping companies to have posted sales in its American Express Shipping Line .
the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
sales increased by 29 per cent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat with a higher cost of larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit posted higher revenues due to higher prices , while earnings fell in freight transport due to higher cost of cost .
at Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent , under a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated conference in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spent two days a week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade the lad@@ z@@ ins .
dro@@ pping over them at one end of the deser@@ ted , two @-@ storey seat of seating there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder of the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and his colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ stage order of Congress : maxim@@ ise of U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that it is an un@@ f@@ used third term . financial stability .
and this third term could be the X factor in a decision which is too close to predic@@ t them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the proximity to zero @-@ lying interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , recent turbul@@ ences contribute to the global financial markets , to increase these vol@@ atility by raising the interest of interest for federal debt - and it is also only by one quarter of one percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief of the Mak@@ ers , said Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the rate of interest not rise , increased in@@ security around the global market enough just@@ ification , continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sen@@ sus on what the F@@ ed is doing , which un@@ sec@@ ures himself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who recently have been questioned about Bloomberg , have predicted a rate of interest this week .
financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this indicates a decline in the share market , in case the F@@ ed increase the proposition , unless they promise the impact of the strike by promise that a further increase is far @-@ removed .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ ,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy up@@ sets the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; I would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they do not get into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that the interest rate would be cal@@ med by the financial markets , because they argu@@ ed the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
still before a month the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow fusion of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States .
as a result of spring and early summer , Y@@ ella had said that in this year , despite the lack of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase of the proposition .
although the creation of employment in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the levels offered by the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
pay@@ roll are shown at signs of recovery .
and although inflation constantly persi@@ sted under the annual goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , a chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but financial markets around the world were gathered together at the end of last month , after China upgraded its currency .
the Dow Jones &apos; average value fell by more than 16 % in May when investors were afraid that a slow@@ ing down from Chinese economy would under@@ go global growth .
the market has re@@ covering a little bit in this month , although the Dow now is almost 10 % below the High E@@ ke of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculation , when to increase interest .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy would not appear in the last few weeks , Mr. Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of US bank@@ note bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty in what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is none of the main concern for the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the she@@ er hint of the former head , Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could close their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; could put out the confusion about the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , they may not only monitor the current developments in other areas , but also discuss with other central banks and experts to maintain a better understanding for the global economy .
its decision @-@ making is &quot; more arts than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the Management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has linked a story of transition effects on financial market movements , which apparently do not appear with the economic bases data . &quot;
stap@@ ler , voting right of the Federal Open Market Committee , set itself for interest rate hike , limited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
in Asia , a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its lead by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a limited extent to growth in the United States , &quot; L@@ acker said .
one year later , the F@@ ed representative revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place the financial stability aspects of financial stability as a drop in the first place in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ations do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is afraid of interest rate because the markets trem@@ bling , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should require the time .

Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she has also still taught with her 74 L@@ ence .
every Thursday she is working at the D@@ ill@@ inger street in the asylum seek@@ ers .
there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , that &apos;s the course of other lessons than at a proper school .
Brazi@@ lians p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian p@@ aci@@ di@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women on how important good diet is during stand@@ still . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted in frag@@ mentation , which are painted with represent@@ ations of harmful food .
breast milk consists of a wide variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide them all nutrients in order to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new findings suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake was not the only dietary change to make the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the gen@@ etics of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ors development .
unfortunately , a child &apos;s un@@ healthy diet may neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
special exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ried Municipal Council approved the construction application for the Euro 2.3 million co@@ sting hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar fl@@ ashes .
the planning for the long @-@ longed facilities at the amber of the canal comes step by step forward : in the most recent office session , the designed building application was blessed without large discussions .
before that , the panel among others had adopted an application for a complete &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ecting &quot; liberation &quot; from the appropriate development plan .
for the &quot; exception &quot; we went the permit for a special form to the roof structure .
therefore a &quot; artic@@ ulated roof is supposed to be built with non @-@ fiction first and bad@@ ger . &quot;
in the background the scheduled use of the roof space for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonder@@ fully big South @-@ roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
with the liberation &quot; of liberation , it once again was about the ti@@ lt of energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan prescribed - below 10 degrees .
this is significantly reduced in the hall &apos;s volumes .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan to be no &quot; exceptions , &quot; but the Bern@@ ers of the community generally becomes quite restric@@ tive in the liberation of liberation .
however , the turn@@ around project is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not provide preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gy@@ ro @-@ building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the community and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs are estimated to be about 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected by school and por@@ ridge .
in the next reporting step , the construction supplement for the 18 x 36 metres of Halle is now submitted to the Coun@@ cil@@ or for the meeting .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be considered planned earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station , as well as the majority of employees prefer from P@@ ei@@ cos@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district circle prior to which the farmer in Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white confirmed .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority of fishermen and the still existing station moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff , which cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered at W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff are informed of the plans .
it has caused the change of dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic first since the beginning of the beginning and is now moving to a private practice near the hospital .
when asked with who the follow@@ er should succeed , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came in to take over the line after J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who declared itself on the line from 1 October , to switch over his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this secured a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; and so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the inner station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
the f@@ ishers for the next two years should be a fisher@@ man with his team , when the Supervisory Board intends to lead both houses , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ader@@ ie , which still has 35 beds , will definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the county has planned this plan for 2018 for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ r@@ ator J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who also is Chairman of the Supervisory Board , has stood contrary to what the house which is owned by the federal government should in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several consider@@ ations .
currently there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ time sy@@ chiat@@ ry are housed here .
&quot; what better could not happen , such an occasion coming again , &quot; as a fisher@@ man over the queu@@ e move to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively received by the employees &quot; positively and very understand@@ able . &quot;
it has not been a real perspective for the house where fishermen worked as chief resident for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take charge of the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) was still threatened by closure , departments became closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Lion are already on the night ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) on the Berg@@ ischer HC .

in a quest for young woman , investig@@ ators first jum@@ ped on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
following a survey conducted in the friends of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , we found a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .

according to the det@@ ain@@ ees , the authorities have been questioned in the police , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been questioned and the dead bodies had to put in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented at the port of the port , the investig@@ ators put him a burden .
in fact , the further inquiries are expected to begin .
refugees need more accommodation : study warns of housing
the situation in the German residential market is stra@@ ined .
increasingly more refugees seek a affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution battle on the German housing market has long since begun .
more people are pushing onto a market with the upcoming refugees and seek@@ ers from the EU , which is now over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
the result comes a study on behalf of the consortium of social housing . &quot;
in comparison , 260@@ ,000 units will be ready in Germany this year .
there@@ with 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are not obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a initial public lodging .
many stum@@ ble on the housing market and in the long queu@@ es , in front of the apartments .
according to Stati@@ stical Office , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however the negative development of the housing market is , however , not only to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable ret@@ ali@@ z@@ ations in the housing policies of recent years .
Germany is a residential development before it , which is t@@ aller from year to year .
at present in the ball areas there were already around 77@@ 0.000 residential units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
thus , many employed people lived in large cities in large @-@ cities .
young adults remained un@@ will@@ ingly in &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the flood .
in major cities the number of square metres per capita has fallen back for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing , &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
in doing so new incenti@@ ves will boost the social housing .
thus , the under@@ growth tax would be om@@ itted and the government taxes for funded rentals will be limited .
the Alliance , moreover , are necessary to ensure attractive depreciation and am@@ ort@@ isation opportunities .
the support program for refugee reports of the Kf@@ W state bank is now well on cities and communities .
a good week after the start was at Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the € 300 million available at the disposal .
now the project could even be picked up .
refugees have free judicial : Croatia and Slovenia are serving a corridor
after Hungary , practically no pass is coming , since more refugees fit the way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces to grant the journey through Slovenia to the north without a hur@@ dle .
dangerous is the route nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Home Secretary Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
according to the annex@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees forced to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people had entered via the border of T@@ ov@@ ari@@ nik , in German TV RTL radio .
on the day before , Hungary had blocked his border for refugees .
new laws that came into force on the same day are practically unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; you can travel , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police had captured the first refugees at the border of Serbia concerning the EU neighbouring country .
most of the media reports indicate that from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus and taxi in the Serbian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to walk on the green border to Croatia .
it is not a f@@ ences in the Croatian @-@ Serbian border .
this will hide the border crossing other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90 &apos;s .
mine@@ fields will now quickly create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , barely any refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 oppos@@ ing people .
shortly before the point of tor@@ tion on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws repe@@ aled the over@@ coming and damage of the border with us as an off@@ ence .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
the sentences ranging from prison until five years , and the expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration agency , a total of 94 applications were recruited on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ seated &quot; border with a total of 94 applications , including almost all - 93 - most important in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicant &apos;s 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees in the morning .
practically , however , nobody has a view to obtain asylum in Hungary .
after the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the past asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
in front of the &quot; Tran@@ seated one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , few hundred refugees assembled at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke work@@ men began to pass .
they collected tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people in the road over the last few weeks .
pl@@ ywood was dismant@@ led and one of the som@@ mel@@ ts situated in the border place was rebuilt .
no one was aimed at the purpose of this building .
Austria will reach only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants , however , stayed in the country still in the country .
in Salzburg some 1400 people wait for the continuation of Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , regular groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
Mayor and mayor &quot; beyond the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had hired the train station with Austria on Sunday , for it was in W@@ ern@@ stein no later , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his assistance and had the stran@@ ded together with two other helicop@@ ters and their cars crossed the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously , we first had un@@ hop@@ ed guests at first , with a break and beverages .
we have said immediately , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
one man didn &apos;t take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it was a pleasure for us , &quot; said the Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the stran@@ ded train passengers climbed up into a regional train to Pass@@ au , following the announcement of the announcement that the rail traffic was dis@@ continued after Germany , but still above the border .
the regional train was shut down before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors grab@@ bed on Sunday before a tw@@ ain bridge on Sunday - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of a apparent field of view :
instead of helping cement help in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke storage system , our Federal Chancellor hosted highly officially and sm@@ ooth@@ ed the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the world &apos;s Dun@@ geons .
loose these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans which are confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
the poultry industry too will have to state that the &quot; Blessed land , &quot; which she has called and welcome , is nothing more to be a refugee camp .
it will be a major challenge , given the persistent refugee flow and the wind that promotes human circumstances of protective seek@@ ers .
and there will be even greater things - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad searching for 35,000 hard@@ ship Qu@@ arti@@ eren
Konrad has filled all hands to refugee with refugee purposes .
Christian Konrad is used to realise that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to create quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the initial centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was no big vort@@ ex , &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ mind . &quot;
the Interior Ministry said by a &quot; ris@@ ky situation . &quot;
altogether , Konrad With a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters is in the he@@ ur@@ red year .
in order to meet the numbers , 35,000 units must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can make it .
&quot; but there is no barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
he has already conducted talks with the govern@@ ors .
they had assured him also for the coming Refu@@ ge@@ es refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; says Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ mand@@ ates supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , in this case shall be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
great expectations also makes the asylum Coordin@@ ator even into the ORF @-@ Action &quot; Help as we . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , it is hop@@ ed for hotels that stand in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in not@@ ary , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ f@@ unders have to pay a certain height of the hand@@ writing holder or the size of the finishing .
for a limited time , &quot; emergency standards must apply . &quot;
in contrast to the ministry that he is successful , Konrad With His experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , who wouldn &apos;t be add@@ ressing the un@@ truth without further .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic , as they stated themselves .
they want to increase their employees on three to four .
the custom aisle search was not so successful until now .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz is calling for a better distribution
no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design centre for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this may not be necessary due to the person concerned with these measures without such measures , says the Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
however , for the emergency , further sites are to be tested on their capability .
cr@@ iti@@ que exercises the chief of gardens at the distribution of refugees in the federal state .
other districts have to offer their contribution here .
seals bearing : &quot; borders are not blocked &quot;
in an extended telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , state @-@ time Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday explo@@ des another approach in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not blocked .
in addition , the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic would still be possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
special prints with refugees in Germany will not give it any more .
however , the protective seek@@ ers would however be brought with regular trains to Germany .
in the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger called for increased solidarity in the refugee question .
the fact that Austria carries out insp@@ ections on its borders is also a logical consequence &quot; by the pioneer of the Germans .
next Run@@ tastic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is drawn , the rest ( 2700 sqm ) shall be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes R@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up firms of the New Ship@@ yard and later also to re@@ use .
from the very beginning S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - out of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ tastic is just a matter of time . &quot;
of S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros has been invested in the location , 3.3 million euros from the tech centre , which belongs to each third of the city of Linz , Austria Upper Austria and the federal state ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is classified by Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ &apos;@@ center .
at 30 percent of the 2700 m2 resi@@ ding in the building have been rented already , for a further 40 percent increase it may be qu@@ eries .

J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to change a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to susp@@ end this project in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ arcade : finally , she has now got the growth in the form of another business .
the Fur@@ la shop in the case of business in which it sells among other things , bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers , all around the brand @-@ hand straps of the Fur@@ la Brand will be around 75 euros .
larger pockets and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
the first time , it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; I have considered a long time whether I am going to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
decisive for the decision was also that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were of the idea of a unique site where only their hand@@ bags were sold at which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region of Linz , which sell these brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even took Italian roots .
her fashion interest has put her mother &apos;s cra@@ dle in the cra@@ dle .
that &apos;s me most , if something is developing and I can demonstrate new trends for performance prices .
why such a woman may not respond to a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , but the specialist can not respond with the last security .
maybe that &apos;s making a nice bag of every out@@ fit .
the ro@@ ull@@ func@@ es@@ macher in K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ ä@@ uble ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also links with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he comments on foreign host@@ ile , mon@@ eti@@ qu@@ ette or knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - candidates for the US presidential address em@@ power@@ ing the campaign power@@ ing .
fork off well and cut off well .
it is also registered in the el@@ äl@@ z K@@ all@@ stadt where the grand@@ parents of the real estate of millions come from .
the New Yorker , with the F@@ cili@@ vi@@ ur village , is very important in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine street .
man@@ chers in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ place is about -@@ zig corners along with it related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that will somehow be exciting , but in their cas@@ ual way you didn &apos;t get as deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ ie has directed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous air@@ bags , to which beside Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
ro@@ gue , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - according to the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he gave it not to the king of the hearts .
while there is respect about the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ces the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was already a bit of big &apos; la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the dealer , she says .
from the village of An@@ ders , Tr@@ ump comes from the village .
the tro@@ op &apos;s success story started 1885 , when the succe@@ eding grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold mines .
the foundation stone of the property &apos;s property was first major in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from the tragedy : her desire to return to home , in the Bavarian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was on .
he did not take Tr@@ ump , because he once was once exhausted without hom@@ olog@@ ation , was the Director of the Institute of Medical History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , for film start@@ up .
ro@@ gue is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is reflected in contrast to the adv@@ an@@ ta@@ geous statements of the night .
the one had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and required the construction of a landmark wall to deter them illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arized , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative to Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a native running Heinz &quot; ) .
the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er retired who Americans are rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so sin@@ tered . &quot;
do he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never got mu@@ til@@ ated around K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension worker in Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons how many K@@ all@@ y@@ ad@@ ter menti@@ ons that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came up with a visit to the church &apos;s church , which ended up well in general .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine evil from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
it would be better if he did not make the choice , because &quot; he has such radic@@ ally views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
if those who had his grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ke Sarah Büh@@ ler .

vali@@ date &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominated the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show .
Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson to report the liber@@ als after the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als but it has provided no large shifts in the Today ass@@ essments .
the regional show from Nine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Do@@ bull has managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the anch@@ or@@ age David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ ard , was stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of the insur@@ rection appeared not to play an role in Australian TV viewers because the average of sunrise received an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators with five capit@@ als compared to Today 33@@ ,000 .
today Today , a slight increase in Rat@@ ings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today , in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today launched an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50.000 .
hi@@ ther@@ to , in September , sunrise on an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators is approaching 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting , what happens each morning .
the winds of the change affect this morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are OK , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number from Sha@@ to the Raf@@ itter Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recently promised Father , who decides to settle in with his two children on the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thomson could bear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ itter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result from yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and proposed light The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half @-@ hour ( from 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new tri@@ via show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe y@@ ielded the average 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( from 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half an hour of The Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour tot@@ alled 7@@ 20,000 spectators .
hot @-@ seat on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as for the second evening of The Chase Australia , nine are confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will end at around 17 : 30 .

the last three voices are : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who is he who is going to choose ?
un@@ cover secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons &apos;s Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ know@@ ingly obvious who wins The Bachelor .
the woman who eventually got a bach@@ s to the Sam Wood in The bach@@ s was env@@ elop@@ ed in secret sec@@ rec@@ y .
and there is no doubt one of the three remaining girls won &apos;t mention them , whether it is the one that has received the last Rose .
but when we were with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before using three two , you may probably acci@@ dentally put a note on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips till the final on Thursday .
all three women have left out in ly@@ rical ways , why wood is the perfect man and they called it his sense for hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive approach as reasons for why they like to be their partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should get the latest Rose ? , &quot; could their answers to be destroyed , who won the Bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - Mack@@ ay , as best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had an easy relationship with each other for their first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that all over the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
Sarah stands with both feet on the ground , making it so much fun to be together with it , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that it would be well suited to Sam Wood as a couple .
in their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that final week of her final week made her clear that Wood &quot; would be one . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this obviously isn &apos;t just a game - I guess it would have been waiting for him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose who Wood should choose if not she was , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be on air on Wednesday at 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent after his impressive day of day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some co@@ aches have banned Hay@@ ne &apos;s rest for the rest of the game when he lost a rum@@ or while the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League fin@@ ite did with his first pun@@ t on Tuesday at a 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t @-@ return and even in the current game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
rather than grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the rest of the team by the grin@@ der , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne in a press conference following the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reference Cam Editor You reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist staff coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to catch his pat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne &apos;s patented in a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first district of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian par@@ ol@@ ship would have been hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
after the fatal flu@@ ffy , Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a wor@@ sen@@ ing launch in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; it was a thing that appears now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne made his original debut at the time in 2007 when a pass running at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it gave it during the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free Party leader .
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as fast as possible .
therefore Ai@@ ar@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
the FW partner crit@@ ici@@ zed that several federal states must not be consistent , &quot; We will see nationwide standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria post@@ p@@ ones , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to be more competitive . &quot;

a year of years of endurance is on the agenda : the policy policy .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen cans at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four men , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after police fired Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ shells to protest against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday was one .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive officials said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire@@ bom@@ bers .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot into the air before returning to rubber .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the g@@ ums applied by rubber , of which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously a high death rate produced .
the dispute was the last week of violent protest at Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed in line with the proposed new constitution would cut their political influence .
there were protests in the western part of the ethnic group of Th@@ ames who want to join their own state .
a minimum of 40 people , including 11 police officers , were disp@@ utes in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in the provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution since 2008 has been on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that thousands of people killed thousands of people .
the legisl@@ ature voted to submit this week about certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution might come into effect on Sunday .

the most interesting , the medium @-@ sized companies of the &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ dem Council .
originally , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary regime which had submitted to the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends from the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; we still haven &apos;t any questions , &quot; he said in front of the members of the Board and more than 50 visitors .
but it may be good to meet all rum@@ ors right now .
for months past ten to 12 million euro support project is in discussion .
sharp reactions under marine regions , which came into the meeting , called the pictures and new details of the desired hotel structure .
Roberto Schulz , den@@ ier owners and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant that is over@@ flowing all other fle@@ ece . &quot;

for easily overweight diabetes , weight loss can be helpful .
the benefits of losing weight loss for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data needs a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss operations or adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body @-@ own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity was effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient , but most studies were performed in people who have disease @-@ based grease with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered to be ob@@ ese .
you may calculate your BMI here : us . / 1@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - gast@@ b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ cers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BMI of those surveyed with this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
consequently , the BMI of those who did not receive @-@ surgical treatments ranged from approximately equal to 29 .
among those treated with a surgical procedure , 36 % of the Diabetes @-@ disease is completely destroyed and in part 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , the diabetes group showed only in one percent and partly with only about two percent .
the results were also found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors .
the researchers also overs@@ aw the patient &apos;s blood pressure ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
in A@@ 1@@ c hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best maintained below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in decreased in A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , there remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as opposed to the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , such as the Head of researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also contrac@@ tu@@ ally ver@@ b average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ t@@ ect@@ omy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , higher returns of the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete breakdown of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new trial has not demonstrated a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a major study in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , &quot; says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , there was a obesity epidemic which under@@ took an obesity epidemic , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new trial showed no advantage for survival in the patients &quot; patient , Black@@ stone said it would be soo@@ thing for persons with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the process .
&quot; that is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone hasn &apos;t added that people and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously when the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have fixed their bodies with obesity and diabetes , recur@@ ring is really hard . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not assume all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist guide also urged to end the violence in the region of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 day visit in the United Kingdom during his 10 day visit to the opening of the Dalai Lama for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the common interests of humanity intended to be the interests of individual nations or as continents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the response of the Western European countries would be ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to find out the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education which can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot;
ultimately , we must re@@ consider how the killing is reduced in their lands .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented on George Bus@@ h@@ s &apos;s actions after the September 11 terrorist attack , leaving a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he made violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .

he said that some children absorb disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ sample in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of an inexpensive experience .
young@@ sters used to mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic s@@ mu@@ til@@ ised water to receive a harder drink .
younger children can be s@@ cour@@ ged by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; says Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , grapes and orange du@@ el , which are very attractive for children .
leather disinf@@ ection can be found anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol &quot; , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison note centre at the Hospital of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would have no si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people let this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant reach in reach of children , and when children come from it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year girl who recently had been taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the strawberry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ection of the school was taken into an emergency department .
her blood @-@ alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which was legally considered by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor that treated them at G@@ wave Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ te her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the notation .
doctors overs@@ aw her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and bowed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ zi &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended , non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants to use and disinf@@ ect disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
using alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected to death .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario , after the end of the disinf@@ ection apparatus , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declar@@ ative ingredient .
employees of health authorities believe that the product me@@ thanol is contained , a le@@ thal solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ alkoh@@ ol , used as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class planned to have their &quot; mas@@ cul@@ ate &quot; teacher , for@@ getting anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , so there is a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to ham@@ let disinf@@ ection and t@@ anned them from their room .
the police lied with the instruc@@ tors &apos; Plan as &quot; D@@ w@@ add@@ z &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary measures to the school authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

odo@@ urs : no dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic
Griff@@ i@@ ths played the talk of dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , there is that the ho@@ ops are standing on a bad place , but that he would turn it again .
Hear@@ ts S@@ FA for ap@@ olog@@ ation to N@@ eil@@ son and War@@ bur@@ ton should be careful with January @-@ new obligations that could destroy the squ@@ ad unit

Adam Ro@@ bo@@ ys El@@ f@@ rom@@ eter was in the first half @-@ time Aber@@ deen &apos;s first half @-@ time victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ gen@@ e , so that the d@@ ons are creating a five @-@ point gap between himself and Cel@@ tic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede about dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow , what was turned off by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates don &apos;t stand under elevated control as they prepare for con@@ frontation with the Dutch national leaders .
I don &apos;t think we feel at pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bo@@ red Dutch nationals - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and past national players from the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , because there is no title @-@ ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland she will show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ ger is not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the ran@@ ger .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams , and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m @-@ games , and there are not only the people in Scotland that want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepts that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian boss hon@@ ors to turn things .
following the defeat against Malmö and the following separate departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , who now stand at the head of the table with five points .
but Sh@@ eila answered : &quot; Cel@@ tic had already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out as quickly as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly as - but we need to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic support , because that makes the players better .
now , it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully with January transfers
despite his comments prior to a few weeks ago , the suggest@@ ion that he made some January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is c@@ auti@@ ously at the signing of new appro@@ ach@@ ments and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ ders .
the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come in the summer will have these pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by clicking the necessary player to the one you really need .

Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to win against Hamilton &quot; un@@ successfully . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es was thinking that he had to fight his crew of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ tions , who brought them a seventh consecutive division , which brought them a lead of five points against Cel@@ tic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ bo@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; There is no team that has won all , playing in cups or lights , the games of that sort even won &apos;t win . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was achieved over the figure of 5.5 per cent , as shown in the numbers for national statistics ( for dating only ) .
in the meantime , the employment fell into Scotland by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the annual UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
commenting on the recent figures , Secretary of State for Scotland , David Mund@@ ell said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to stay in part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline of unemployment .

why I being witness of execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
something later , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in an spectators gallery in the death chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison bub@@ bles .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January for his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
as the day was approaching , I started to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see exec@@ utions in the US as there are often more applications available as seats , there will be a regular lot@@ tery instead of decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected will watch it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone lines and a two and a half hours visiting .
I like the guy .
often , we laugh much when we speak .
the jail @-@ authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a notebook &amp; pen in order to record what I see .
I simply have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of climbing my in@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she admitted that she could have been better phr@@ ase , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I have spoken and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses every time .
but he wants an international reputation is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help ag@@ grav@@ ated the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Podcasts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ es would make him guilty of being a min@@ ent of crime .
but I believe there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is no sufficient evidence to just@@ ify death .
I believe that his execution is false .
and I &apos;ll see him from this perspective .
I can not claim , really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , in which you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man of unnecessary death .
man to fire after hum@@ id police ch@@ ases , coming from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he survived the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man from Perth to hang the police , was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer , who was trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
C@@ anning V@@ ale was called the police in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday , Tuesday following Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I come not out , come and catch me , &quot; said Senior became Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .

&quot; sometimes people are fun things to try and escape , &quot; Senior became Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Master @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller : Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 Cou@@ sins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape an alcohol control , and then tried to swim over the Swan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ un him , and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to finish the race at once .
he acted to the ste@@ wards and the Integration Unit of Racing Victoria , claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ e on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found himself in difficult conditions as it was the positive Kob@@ old @-@ virtu@@ ous sample at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he had refra@@ ined from 18 months for sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want to see how big dro@@ oping grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing to it , and I have looked for it a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything is coming out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know it has gone .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live what I have said .
today I will go home and sleep well .
I want to go about the head , and I want my owner , that I tried my best for her .
if they start thinking , I do that , then I should not be a coach .
then I have to consider what I do with my license .
before that , Moo@@ dy had the bomb in an interview with the rac@@ er that the Integration Unit had tried to sp@@ ire its stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart said in a room with a man - I &apos;ll get asked , and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am an im@@ post@@ or .
if that is the case , they should certainly take care of their n@@ oses , because she is trying to deal with it by an attempt to sc@@ ap@@ point me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ xe , current CEO of Route L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
would that lead me to think that personally ?
did the Route L behave ti@@ ly , and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there , that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on it and pushing it to make a decision .
I have support my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it Less@@ ons of the Train@@ ers have been set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting wounds , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching leading to him that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the non @-@ allied master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my cow@@ or@@ kers has er@@ ron@@ ged mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have happened yesterday for the whole day so it was like that .
but it had so on the race day too .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the racing day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules , do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy said .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy due to rival for claims to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy speci@@ alizes in tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites by the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson : the arbit@@ er of the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring battle &quot; will be allowed to compete with his team during the high Storm Vic@@ tory in Sydney Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a ti@@ pped note to the Storm @-@ Team , after his team had won the Final win against North Queensland cow@@ boys on Saturday nights . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; by the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland may not &quot; too good &quot; in the R@@ ingen .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ends the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that it is only focused on the tac@@ kling , only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team is confident , since it was that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; it &apos;s always up again - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson called for Ring@@ berg as they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing about our def@@ ensive System or the techniques all year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles for a real gravity ; and that has been done for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he apparently has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a little shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this emerg@@ es again at this time of time .
Bell@@ amy was attacked on &quot; exciting football &quot; using the &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or to remind that Benn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne talks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed as a boring team in 2010 , and Wayne said that he will take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he &apos;s a team that can play and that we look as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play when you &apos;ve found this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust , because they tell these things because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when the Big games went .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result than the Game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 and there were two more attempts in our game but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks ? are there any points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they do mention us , it means that we are going to meet in a stage yet .
the Storm @-@ Team got off on this weekend as they have won the right either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bs with 200,000 deposit for drug con@@ cl@@ an@@ age
a man who may possibly have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence to come to the possession of 40 kilos of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gled into Queensland , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug in the yacht Sol@@ ay coming from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite the potentially life sentence for the attempt to have a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café during a harmless reason could have been .
judge on the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the haz@@ ard in Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in case of the case , he lied to the police on his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ mother had offered a $ 200,000 deposit of $ 200,000 in common to achieve his release .
&quot; according to reading the ei@@ des@@ able explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judges Flan@@ agan .
but that will not suff@@ ice for him to stop him , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serb passport , reports to the police daily and is holding an initial barrier of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ oph@@ ile to the sending of pictures
a ped@@ oph@@ ile used the phone for an 11 year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone off the girl when this slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ related pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it , and found the conf@@ using news and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analyzed the computer , which were found under the address and discovered a &quot; gra@@ ff@@ ing &quot; Web @-@ research , which used concepts for searching for un@@ interested pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g therefore conten@@ ded with the officials , that he would have done it , as there would be &quot; P@@ nu@@ oph@@ ile &quot; in the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the attor@@ ney lam@@ entation Ei@@ li@@ dh Robertson said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a diction that he is addic@@ ting to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the searching was done on the computer from him , but said that it was done , because he wanted to say a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asking him to send out more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick of his mind , when he drinks , and said that he would see pictures of rape and murder .

are locks on small border transfer to Germany
more refugees are taken apart from the large @-@ air traffic lights on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ user were moved from fear of discovery and capture the people with smaller border trans@@ itions
out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police said .
along the river river Inn , Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have been picked up more than 1000 refugees since Tuesday .
they were walking through bridges and st@@ icking to the German side .
there they will be submitted by Federal police officers in reception and re@@ directed to registration .
at the Munich Main Railway station , the police dis@@ continued much more refugees in comparison with the German police on Wednesday .
approximately 700 people arrived in the provincial capital alone at 8 : 00 p.m. , spokes@@ man on the morning .
after the introduction of insp@@ ections on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ erunner of tropical storm , Henry &quot; worth in the Sou@@ thwest

because of a deep pressure from Western Europe , warm sea air in the country approved the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strong tro@@ ugh@@ s be called &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drag@@ ged over the Atlantic in recent days over the past few days .
fierce storms and storms are expected primarily in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning even in the Black Forest , the Schw@@ äb@@ ische Al@@ b and the Lake Constance District with ar@@ ches of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour is expected .
on Friday , the sun lets you look back .
the mass makes it : every two years the car drivers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact vehicles that are currently selling well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : some 28,@@ 1 percent of new registrations accounted for the Federal Office of the Federal Republic ( KBA ) alone at this segment , in August alone .
this is reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , numerous new models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for German motor@@ ways is the Opel Astra , which will be tra@@ ced to tra@@ ders in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann said on the exhibition .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order to sell the volume model also well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel is launching a entry under the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf , which starts at around 6@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is available only as a five @-@ door car .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station w@@ agon which is also shown at the IAA .
and what is going on next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra range Mé@@ gan@@ e racing .
at the fair , Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively used as a fifth in a conventional and highly acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT @-@ version .
at the beginning of next year , it comes into trade , then a station w@@ agon .
Infin@@ iti : entirely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan &apos;s branch wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
so the compact Infin@@ iti with its wav@@ ed lines fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment too , the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine with an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ ac in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not quite new , but completely renovated , the compact class DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA .
the designers of the noble Citroën presents all the hand in front of the front lines : the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was built .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been modernis@@ ed , which reduces the number of buttons by its screen and first integrate Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play first .
in addition to the compact class at the IAA , a series of over@@ working and new variants like the newly ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are human beings
the Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ gericht has given a det@@ ain@@ ee of the Te@@ gel &apos;s judicial complex that had been accommod@@ ated in a small cell in months .
because of the infr@@ in@@ gement of their human rights , prisoners are generally entitled to compens@@ ate for financial compensation when they are in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in an extradition hearing on Wednesday .
the affected judges can even hope for money , even if they were imprisoned in the close rooms for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successfully completed in Karlsruhe ; he was accommod@@ ated in a cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet resi@@ sted not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who was moved back to his wal@@ let is now re@@ located on free foot , in a larger cell .
ad@@ ditions to the ruled against Berlin in Berlin because of the outstanding adher@@ ence against the Berlin country .
however , the Constitutional Court over@@ took the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of the Berlin and referred the case for the renewed test .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Kammer@@ gericht decides on the amount of the compensation
although legal reasons , for the question@@ able period only a few days of working days are decisive for the compensation , there was a declaration that was said .
otherwise it would be a mis@@ carriage of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the constitu@@ tion@@ eers have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they only spoke in April to a prisoner of damage , because he was imprisoned in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is also the 2011 decision to ag@@ ul@@ li@@ ze the multi@@ function of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which a prisoner of men had been agreed to a decent housing on Wednesday , in November 2009 .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place over three months daily between 15 to 21 hours in a similar store , as in the Karlsruhe case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have hit the head@@ lines in the last few weeks .
prisoners are therefore being ro@@ oted up again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness of aggression exists , even to sle@@ dges it has already been able to take place because of the all@@ ying position .
according to information of the judicial systems 21 positions in Te@@ gel were not occupied due to young od@@ or , 19 should be dropped in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
immigration from refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is determined to assume it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Health this year , according to the declaration of Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated how the unusual challenge proves to be clear : &quot; I will say again and again : we can do this , and we create it . &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
it is needed for a range of forecasts ranging from 350@@ 000 ( E@@ stim@@ ate the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( E@@ stim@@ ate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dra@@ stically reduced , but above all paid rentals : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing is out of the ten@@ der@@ - and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
a lot too little is the point of view of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest 6.4 billion euros per year .
in a single manner , scientists and federal state are that there must be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and professional research , 55 per cent of the poultry sector can be employed in Germany over the long term .
however , refugees in Germany would not require a systematic response to their qualification in order to help them get started by Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
however , for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they find jobs in Germany .
work is the key for social contacts , for appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Tab@@ sch@@ hardt .
according to the throne , in Germany , according to the throne , there has been a political turn of the Ministry for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
while there was a ban on asylum seek@@ ers for over five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence light , asylum seek@@ ers have been confin@@ ed to a place for asylum .
in society as well , because of the lack of professionals , the point of view is clear that refugees should be made faster of access to the labor market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the job market are missing German language skills .
there are so far not yet a sufficient offer of general and business @-@ related language courses .
tests show that work@@ stations are often communic@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , according to the view of Band@@ än@@ hardt the Royal Path to Work Integration .
the Berlin school government determined that only a few ge@@ ese parents give her children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ e@@ av@@ ed parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ de@@ able , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of K@@ ita , the management boards divide in different languages .
if the demand for teachers are heavily poll@@ uted by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities , by appro@@ ving more special schools .
students , without German knowledge classes are being prepared for classes in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by full trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have an qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ings from the Berlin school administration .
the German student estimates that some 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
basically , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or remembrance of the study - the only exception was to have been Berlin , In@@ en@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) but has finally abandoned its attitude .
study ra@@ ins refugees could facilitate access to the university .
because refugees are allowed to be a permit or for@@ tification there are no more services after asylum seek@@ ers .
the latter could not get Af@@ rop@@ ho@@ g , because they do not fall under the supp@@ ression of b@@ af@@ ood .
to date , the number of refugees had to have lived in Germany until now , to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ G entitled to be entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , but also require Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should get rid of B@@ af@@ o@@ G immediately .
in future Islam will play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component in its identity .
the state should be gradually emp@@ tied the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state @-@ churches @-@ law to a new state @-@ religions .
it would also be the creation of a Islamic welfare state that looked professional for the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights also may be obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam must unite and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to as@@ sign certain control possibilities .
to this , willingness , producer still belongs to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed by the concern for religious conflicts , might also be carried in Germany on Thursday .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on the Arabic .
integration will be much more than today , a topic of the whole society .
in doing so , the majority society will need to change the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination Office since the first decade and an establishment of gender equality law .
but it is learning very slow how the NSU @-@ m@@ ord@@ Series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stak@@ eholder organisations are calling for a long time to challenge the international agreement as the anti @-@ racial abuse in Germany , must remain in the next few years if the country will remain peac@@ efully and its new citizens should utili@@ ze their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany is capable of providing medical support to the expected refugees , said Mr. Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery , Chairman of the Order .
&quot; as Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , for all the trav@@ ellers , are to be handed over to registration health payments .
later , services could later be calculated with the federal states .
and in the long term it was highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited performance catalog will advance to the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , physicians will make the language bar@@ riers to the doctors .
it has been proved that in Berlin &apos;s health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de , migrants are fatal across her diseases as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in physician offices would have to be taken over , calls for them .
many are also working for refugees , but also with more common medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic eye .
in the refugee camp , there are so clearly more untreated disabilities , and in the young people it is going to take care of HIV .
however , with some other symptoms of discovery , German doctors explo@@ res German doctors , however , rep@@ ented Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; Paras@@ ite decline or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as for the medical care , in sight of the refugees , even in sight .
the Syrians are a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to ass@@ ert their quali@@ fications and did not need to ex@@ pose any further examination .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is based on estimates by the Federal Patent Court ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulner@@ able to refugee camps , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains the president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee ship was trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who is suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from flash backs , short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart rate and death rows .
other symptoms include insom@@ nia and concentrate , strong irrit@@ ability , and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , premature treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z stated .
until now , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees get psycho@@ therapy .
true , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can apply a request for psycho@@ therapy for psycho@@ therapy , but most of them usually take several months .
in addition , in the social establishments , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , would decide whether a therapy is required or not .
this often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard becomes more than 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to create 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the scope of restructuring and savings efforts to the company &apos;s services .
hp will split up this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business of its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job rate causes a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost framework for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after the separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide range of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned as ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ achieved , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; such as a statement by the company .

FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate from the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already suggests that Wil@@ der is sure to miss the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its stake is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame with this current problem is that Wil@@ der had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not hurt the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
it is no bigger thing .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with its ank@@ le or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from purely medic@@ inal view , but as Wen@@ ger also accepted , there is the accompanying risk of other injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses in Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ and performances in the last five times .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six times since 2007 / 08 , most of the most vulner@@ able days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but ar@@ senal estimated that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability ratio during the last season is going .
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a hard time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fight force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he is doing a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal kicks off his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces herself to the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not driving according to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta means to start .
Wen@@ ger may also begin with k@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the equilibrium and the players who need it to gain a small bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although Arsenal are continuing its clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadium in Zagreb is one of the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale was 3,2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is that ar@@ senal all over the last season with the Champions @-@ League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European policy name .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .

Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons on defects of men
the absence of similar performances in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now is more dou@@ bt@@ ful than ever before , how self @-@ mor@@ als prove among young men on a 15 year yo@@ ke .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men ranging from 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more likely in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ aign Against The Mis@@ er@@ ase ( CA@@ LM ) campaign against a very bad life ) announced as the year of a man to ask the aim of looking for the culture in question when they need them .
friendship is our heart in combat to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances for gen@@ esis doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course , you have to get friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on the style of substance , is often more important than the importance of the answer .
our digital life have the need to appear strongly , fun and successful , even if the isolation domin@@ ates in effect .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by which psych@@ ologists define ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our internal desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor , and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but defined by his personality that sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ug@@ s , Mom@@ ents at football player in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire for Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can rely on each case even if they are often kept back to explore fully their feelings .
as one employee of the phone care I explained to me : ... &quot; my listen@@ er role for people who are de@@ pressed people and are confident , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends could make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not in a position to talk to friends .
the old phr@@ asing &quot; I come with it right &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when people say about problems open . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ lasting tru@@ ism .
she clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s kin@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ der status via telephone the people in moments of despair can also assist you , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day totally new back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you can sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone , give him a smile and say hello .
one never knows what the difference might make your friendship .

Mary meets Mary to help PS@@ G to un@@ lock Mal@@ mo
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh in Cav@@ ani for his time against Malmö .
this debut in the Champions League at his debut on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G direct to Malmö .
here are the playing records and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Mary and Edinburgh visited Cav@@ ani than Paris Saint @-@ Germain had launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G players who brought the French champion on the way , but after that , they missed a series of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head of headphones .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A you need a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they do not only stri@@ ve the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Round , but improvement on the way to the quar@@ ter@@ finals in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ h@@ ov@@ ics missed chances in front of the gate . he was later began in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustr@@ ate career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we have won , although I regret it , we have not yet scored one or two more gates . &quot;
Ibra@@ h@@ ovic returned after his wound in one of three modifications to the Paris @-@ Team , which managed a 2 : 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was kicked out by Di Mary in the fourth minute .
the Argentin@@ ian wing extrem@@ ist was referred to as the man who could take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he ran out of Manchester United in the last month of Manchester United , as he entered in Marco F@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense . he was passing by Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would have a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic took part in an play @-@ off to achieve this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man def@@ ending and two deep in the middle field ex@@ foli@@ ating a heavier opponents .
but apart from a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed much to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ inc@@ est in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself appeared sometimes on , with some patches with flaws and poor closing , which was not least patented in the first half of the trials and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he showed much more skill , when he brought his players to the game and it was a pass of Ibra@@ h@@ amp@@ ovic , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the P@@ fo@@ sten ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the Cav@@ ani mark . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er also achieved its sixth year of season , after Ibra@@ h@@ agen had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that Malmö can return to the game , and only one excellent intervention by Wil@@ m from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could stop the end result , before the subst@@ it@@ utes Ez@@ ou@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi could be sc@@ anned a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play had been in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the quali@@ fications do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
tur@@ ban in front of Paris !
it was a great play of them !

during a sequence of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown who emphas@@ ised the need of alternative perspectives and with regard to a black protagon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do in the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ating un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actors from The Mar@@ tian re@@ lie@@ ve .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the industry @-@ cent@@ ered Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to invite people to think about it - who will always be the director as well - as they handle the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown initially .
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is beaten by her white Zu@@ h@@ itz .
the producer of the island of De@@ e@@ White was seated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right on the film ; Dam@@ on rep@@ lied that their direction &quot; could give up something we could not want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - this is SO W@@ ISS that it will hurt . &quot;
Twe@@ et served more than 5.000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments will come at a time , at the exact ra@@ ci@@ ographic representation in the media at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ emen , the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter has been nationwide and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities to don@@ ate discrimin@@ ating practices against col@@ li@@ ent in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .

&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports clim@@ bs and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night to win the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition Show , which had just finished her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants , which could conclude every stage of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the climbing on a 75 @-@ foot wire rope in 30 seconds was added to the last task .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge to a full three seconds qu@@ icker , which made him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! News after the fierce victory , still under the shock over the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; Isaac E said ! about his he@@ ap .
as quite suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the Director @-@ producer K@@ ent We@@ ed won with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all , did not get any prize money .
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one receives the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great atro@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s got a groove on this .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the crowds of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have equally felt when they drove the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to an eighth season , which will start fil@@ ming in the spring of 2016 .
pass Detroit Tig@@ ers with Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ N@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they had one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today &apos;s Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but the part performed perfect against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins announced a chance to climb up in a game part of Houston ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card Platz .
for Detroit , though only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to deal with a large part of the season &apos;s second half of the season .
&quot; all winning rounds are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Bra@@ m said .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inst@@ ances , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 of the interior and made it possible for three victories .
it wasn &apos;t his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ do@@ zers of each game , and so I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , its first R@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits for the Seattle marin@@ ers on 6 July .
&quot; he wrought the fire@@ wood well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good for ( impact training ) , looked well better from the bull@@ se@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game .
with three victories in the back at the end of the seventh seal the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton stopped the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful one and Simon bringing up his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy went on the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano who became a two @-@ run .
with a pair of le@@ aning and the conclusion @-@ run during the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen resulted in the third Baz@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play .
it was the major league leading in the major league for the 27th time in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe was a double play .
after Detroit put off a net @-@ Run at the end of ninth inside the Wall brought a R@@ B@@ I double against the loose tiger &apos;s Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed A@@ ano is out with three Pit@@ ches for the fifth floor .
in this way , Detroit offered the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hugh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three stages in the first two inst@@ ances against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the game of injuries in front of the game when he had been missing more than one month .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I liked it , &quot; Hugh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would get some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off batt@@ ali@@ on , H@@ oms gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought up Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; with the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success with the Run@@ time in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third B@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right side , succeeded in another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third on what the threat posed .
the tiger &apos;s threw in the second was a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; says T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ ec@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t work especially well , but he got the right spot .
Hugh@@ es were found in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , made no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the Rel@@ e@@ ver @-@ handed standing A.@@ J.@@ A@@ gar .
Hugh@@ es made three hits on six hits and a walk with four different stro@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sanchez was eliminated because of a lim@@ b injury .
it is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the world &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder @-@ part , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
having been out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the vulner@@ ability of injuries to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since then he was acquired with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 .
he has been missing since 20 August because of a dist@@ ortion in the right hip .

the Federation shall cont@@ end this together with the countries that Merkel speaks on Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour deliber@@ ations by the Prime Minister in the Berlin office of the law office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people , who need protection , turned this also .

no diet fruit - man@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Man@@ os are exotic and mo@@ ist @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line is rather sha@@ de@@ ed by them .
because Man@@ os contain relatively much sugar - mainly su@@ cro@@ se .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square .
in the presence of the town of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a very well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German re@@ generate .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured &quot; as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for the Lutheran churches of the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , a pastor of the Protestant Lutheran congregation in Rome , remembered that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often seen as minority in the secret of their faith .
with the square , symbo@@ lic@@ ally visible , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the beginning of the year 1510 / 11 .
he felt the city back then . he was a sin@@ ner @-@ fit .
his negative impressions ar@@ ra@@ ged him by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther continued to use his theses on the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the western church .
British artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gilded ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar are painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who set up his personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas , in 150 moti@@ ves .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year @-@ old - but in no way equ@@ alled with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , namely , this can be quite dark .
in terms of three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he met a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic choice among the many subject areas of the &quot; Book of All Books . &quot;
there are cycles that arise regarding topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
in doing so , he spont@@ aneously posts several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is , especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with on the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ ble authorities .
he interpreted the Bible records by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current context . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al Spiegel of Al@@ ts painting .
in fact , it is nestled among Martin Luther &apos;s original perio@@ dical and a set of artist who form@@ ulates his personal idea about the respective situation .
the jewelry cord wra@@ ps with gold .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is allowing twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotion .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions had finally existed at all trig@@ gers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and brought up in Berlin , coming from a family which belonged to the strict Protestant pastor .
&quot; when the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt reminds himself .
&quot; I tried to stop working with the Lord , perhaps to wear me again with the Father . &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ produce art in a more fast time again : &quot; the perception of imag@@ inations is marked today by advertising , and that is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different lust and glad@@ ness , to show things .
images always have a bit mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to &quot; Ob@@ ject &quot; the viewer in the pictures , &quot; they can rely on , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image seeks his anti@@ d@@ ote . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; had always been &quot; an lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like what he understands with his pictures . &quot;
I haven &apos;t believed to capture the Bible completely , but those important for him , also myst@@ ical themes .
&quot; it was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text says simply . &quot; it was written in the pictures of the Bible .
for Hans M@@ öhler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for M@@ öhler and the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented in an exhibition for the first time , opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction start for BM@@ X railroad

so hill top@@ pled , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval was going to enter in October , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock will now report for the child and youth committee in the children &apos;s child and youth committee .
&quot; I hope this year will have happened even more visible , &quot; she said .

DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the league will make clear signs at the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the more sunny situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the policy of helping the rising problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , this is nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in everyone , using this theme in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the State Minister , Ms Ö@@ z@@ al@@ uz and ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could be and wanted to help .
but the decisive points must set the policy .
thus , the German football federation has expanded its refugee quot@@ ative &quot; 1 : 0 for an Welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we ensured through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; Mr Nier@@ s@@ bach went on the ver@@ ge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
even some federal states support this programme .
this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ bre@@ l set a clear sign if it is on the left tri@@ cot engine instead of the usual signal of sponsor@@ ing ( Hermes ) to help the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everybody ought to help , where and how they can only do , &quot; says Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Senior Partner Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ granted . &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama passed every one , nobody &apos;s allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football , no , we need to use our radi@@ ant power , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have already been so unbeliev@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent mark of the league . &quot;
the national qualifying match against Hungary on this Friday invites women of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach worth the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements have started their own projects in their locations , be great .
just great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for an Welcome &quot; which we have spent will be living in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP Res@@ ear@@ ance loses an eye on an accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye for several reports , due to a fall of July .
at midnight on the staircase of his brother &apos;s house in the U.S. , he fell to midnight on a wat@@ ering glass , which he worn in the left hand writes the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bloo@@ dless . he was s@@ wo@@ unding out for the road - he told us so last week , &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP fellow @-@ founder Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could now follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Pl@@ att@@ ner said .
the 54 year @-@ old manager is with the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) to come back to Germany in October and will continue to guide the software power@@ house .
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; obviously I stood in a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Pl@@ att@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t in the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to let him go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen so something . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to stop up when you &apos;re dead . &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes on a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus have definitely lost their first group game in the European League .
the national player is supposed to be the table leader of the soccer league in du@@ el with the f@@ k Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 / Sky ) .
we can &apos;t return on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether R@@ eus is back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team &apos;s top match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach told us : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only alter the R@@ eus position only on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is employed in the future in all European league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left out openly .
with high probability , it will also contest the second game .
the for@@ cing statement by Mit@@ ylene R@@ eus that the Fin@@ al@@ ein@@ ous statement for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League has to be the aim , holding a mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian course for the way : &quot; that &apos;s Marco not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to retri@@ eve the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants to take leadership on Germany
according to the will of the German Federal Government , Germany should be a leading technological pioneer by the change of the German Federal Government .
on Wednesday , the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which presented new investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday at the ver@@ ge of the IAA &quot; IAA &quot; by a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less st@@ aves , said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ part from the G7 countries who come together with representatives of the industry .
the Ministry of Strategy on the Ministry of Transport , among other things , st@@ resses the importance of the mobile broad@@ band extension and a level of asc@@ ension into digital radio ann@@ ot@@ ations .
for testing new technology there is currently a test track on highway 9 in Bavaria .
with the driver &quot; to op@@ pose no additional legal risks &quot; , the German government wants to check the legal framework conditions , &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
for instance , Germany wants to be used internationally to raise the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the federal government will also apply to a change in Vienna &apos;s Convention , which so far only the people are presented as a driver .
with automated driving , the car takes over leadership , the driver becomes more and more to passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which measure the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Economic Ministry of Economic Affairs , high@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
nevertheless , driving less vehicles can be expected to follow &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot;
the authors in the area of driver assistance systems and high@@ lighting functions at the location of Germany appreci@@ ates the authors of the study by 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros .
the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD Transport S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver must be clear however .
the Germans are still scep@@ tical about the Germans , however - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on the AA pen@@ sive survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ ario @-@ Institute in DE@@ K@@ RA , only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be en@@ forced over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it at all ; 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respondents expect by 2025 by car @-@ based cars , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital store , only seven percent would agree to give the control throughout the entire drive on all roads .
on the highway no less than 15 percent could be present at the flow of traffic , than at St@@ au 45 percent .
well all v@@ ases would not leave the car to control under any circumstances .

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;

in this time B@@ oll was located on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsored sponsor@@ ship at China at this time .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to be returned on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer a clear@@ er favourite , &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who led the S@@ etz@@ l in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remin@@ ded the European Championship 2013 in Schwe@@ chat .

Gaul@@ tier does feel old for en@@ en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a great fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequins , which look forward to video projections thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , who was scre@@ ened with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits in the great star of fashion scene - so that he co@@ ats men in sk@@ irts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , &quot; meanwhile it was real , &quot; Gaul@@ tier says .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung &apos;s exhibition , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his mind to a show about his person .
actually , he would have been , for : &quot; an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said .
when you die , one comes into the museum .
the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal , Montreal and Paris .
it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the Director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren !
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly ever @-@ looking works of a man who has written a fashion history without having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ographer , designed to work much effort : to fr@@ om the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist has been involved .
14 tons of material have shi@@ fted the makers by according to the Kur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution was a special gift : a leather watch@@ dog out@@ fit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are scar@@ city than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier .
G@@ aul &apos;s old ted@@ dy is also seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender look of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in the football ) he was attracted to his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , Gaul@@ tier said .
playing a doll would not allowed him to have his parents allowed him .
he felt the dis@@ card of fashion which later he taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion perio@@ dic@@ als and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gaul@@ tier told in Munich .
later , I bought them then .
for his first review , he had not able to pay the models .
they were not allowed to hold their clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ght tip as fashion niche
previously , we went to the long med@@ dle machines in and around pl@@ uses to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large amount for customers , for example , covering blank@@ ets and gar@@ ines .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains pl@@ anting managing director of the Rein@@ hardt .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the pl@@ au@@ ght , fashion played a greater part , was pushed into the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt is a few examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans on last stal@@ ks , an increasing order potential .
those who use no niche in the textile branch in Germany is no longer on the market .
they are already doing the half of all orders .
Mah@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ts lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can carry the protected label .
in the past 15 years , about 80 percent of sales were broken off .
private trade , and also wholesale , there are almost no more .
our products hardly achieve our products in this path .
the mass goods will be much cheaper today in the Asian region , and almost exclusively sold over chains .
it is also weaker , currently based on Russia and the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the nitrogen per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality , which shows that we produce organic and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma architect Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the Western University of Z@@ wick@@ au - specialized in the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and tips .
in order to op@@ pose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design is often only varies , to hold a customer base .
some years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re @-@ designed the historic snow tip .
the press sends small cu@@ ffs on some places .
the gold @-@ wrought gold keeper of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ x called for himself : &quot; before that I couldn &apos;t start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ts . &quot;
now they use the perfect tip for their jewelry .
in a complex process , they domin@@ ate the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of pl@@ au@@ ght - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies in the United States , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors would have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , who want a mem@@ ento .
with this , I see my jewelry as the modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the Pl@@ au@@ ght tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legend is not to be heard , but Disney also makes a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to the &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it is not about a new film footage , but to continue a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magic maid .
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family Ban@@ ks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
but the director has already established : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema .
XI is p@@ ushes to open the economy broad@@ ly for the world
the economy is wider than outw@@ ard , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping , to conduct a group that was commissioned with the steering from the reform .

to promote new thor@@ ough and promote reforms , new swing and vitality will bring about and creating new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of directives , including a negative list for regulation of market access , relaxation of border checks policies , stim@@ ulating political authorities ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population mol@@ ding system .

EU wants to double its limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit levels of mercury in big car@@ cases and consumers with a significantly higher dose of ne@@ ural cre@@ denti@@ als .
the consumer advoc@@ acy F@@ ood@@ watch , who prepar@@ es a proper work@@ group for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans for economic and environmental policy : &quot; risks and side effects failed , &quot; Mr Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , Mr F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have increased the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain like Hai@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; of one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly connected with mercury that on the basis of currently applicable limits , some 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ stable .
in contrast to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to cur@@ b the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram@@ s. of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch featured this but as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ etary are , such as car@@ p usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
therefore , Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , &quot; says Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , &quot; says the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o from Kl@@ einf@@ o . &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal that is strongly stim@@ ulated by the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
the federal government thus warns that &quot; already small amounts may cause particularly un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Information declared its website with regard to the applicable high@@ s , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; is not expected .
mercury is mainly achieved through the coal se@@ wage in the environment .
according to a written information report from the Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ eb@@ re received more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total population em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish is approximately in El@@ be , Rhine and Lower Austria . &quot; permanently and sc@@ uring over , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted in March from the paper .
