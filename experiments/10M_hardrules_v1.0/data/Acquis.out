there are gluten @-@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells which contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) an@@ tigen , which are not glut@@ am@@ inated in general by anti @-@ A serum samples of group B .
one anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum can be dissolved in parallel to the back , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or a corresponding comparison , separated against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is in parallel to that again dissolved , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group or a corresponding comparison , against a floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells .
in no case the effectiveness of the Serb may not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ diluted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum also has a slight recogni@@ z@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ O ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum can be mixed with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent floo@@ ding within a double time , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be dissolved within a double time , but if the same tests are dissolved in the same time , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or with a standard gro@@ ove at the same activity .
if anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Serum can be mixed with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent floo@@ ding with a same amount of 5 @-@ 10 percent , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be dissolved within a double time , however , if the same attempt is dissolved with the back , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ B blood vessels or a standard prepar@@ ative equal to our Avi@@ dity .
if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum on an object carrier mixed with the same amount of 5 to 10 percent of blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h Blood group@@ s@@ era each speci@@ fic@@ ity may be one of two species that distingu@@ ish themselves through the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , among which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
with other , known as &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , a ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or using other particular methods .
some &quot; in@@ complete &quot; Ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating on slides are also homogen@@ ous red blood cells which are sh@@ em@@ ulated in their own serum or plasma .
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group can possibly change if international standard prepar@@ es are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group@@ ed ( human )
anti @-@ D Serum can be obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immune by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h System .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , which contain an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells , which does not contain an@@ tigen D .
&quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 32 versus c@@ c@@ de@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking sal@@ ine solution .
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum samples can be dissolved in parallel to the once again , but un@@ diluted International standard preparation of the in@@ compatibility anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) Ser@@ bs or a corresponding comparison of c@@ c@@ de@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells , that contain an@@ tigen D , the serum is supposed to react after the possibility of using blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , after having mixed up on an object carrier with the same amount of a 40@@ - to 50@@ percent absorption of c@@ c@@ de@@ e bleeding within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completely within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is made from the blood of one or several people , which are immune to the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine C of the R@@ h System .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C but not with human red blood cells that don &apos;t contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
this ser@@ a is therefore specifically designed for the C @-@ an@@ tigen , when the tested blood cells are dissolved in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent cooking sal@@ ine solution .
the tit@@ er of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ de@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and does not contain any form of anti @-@ D blood pressure ) , if they are mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ percent , which must be a visible Ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be fully within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people who are immune to the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h System .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a tit@@ er of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not contained in any form anti @-@ D ) , if they are mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ % caused a visible Ag@@ glut@@ ination , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ c and the speci@@ fic@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ e can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum both antibodies must be effective at the same time as defined in response conditions at the same time .
serum samples are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , so the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ous time in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction , not less than with the anti @-@ part antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is gained from the blood of animals that can be immune to blood cells or specific substances of the group A immune .
anti @-@ A serum gluten @-@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the A @-@ an@@ tigen that says the ones of blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ sets A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B , there are no human red blood cells , that does not contain a A an@@ tigen , that says those of blood groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum samples , parallel to the recovered , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or a corresponding comparison , separated with floo@@ ding the A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on a slide @-@ bearer of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination will perform at any floo@@ ding within the double time , however , if the same attempt failed with the recur@@ ring , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of the anti @-@ A blood @-@ group or a standard prepar@@ ative equal to our Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B Serum is gained from the blood of animals that can be immune to red blood cells or specific substances of blood group B immun@@ ity .
anti @-@ B serum gluten @-@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells , the B @-@ an@@ tigen , that says those of blood groups B and AB ; there are no human red blood cells , that does not contain a B @-@ an@@ tigen that does say those of blood groups 0 and A .
one anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the recovered , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ ative of anti @-@ B blood @-@ group or a corresponding comparison , with a floo@@ ding of blood cells of group B ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of 5 to 10 percent floo@@ ding in a double time , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be carried out within the double time , but un@@ diluted International standard prepar@@ es of anti @-@ B blood vessels or with a standard prepar@@ ative equal to our Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum to use in blood @-@ group human RPE , ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibody against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ izing antibodies must contain against supplem@@ entation factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals that are characterized by injection of human serum proteins .
