it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets ( tablets , which dissolve itself in the mouth ) as a solution for inser@@ ting ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ t thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mist@@ rust and mad@@ ness ; • bi@@ polar disorder , a mental condition that alternating patients with lack of periods ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bil@@ e is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes and pre@@ venti@@ onal periods in patients who have been addressed in the past to the drug .
injection solution is used for fast control of distur@@ b@@ ance distur@@ b@@ ance or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral medication should not be possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used to capture or use the melting tablets in patients who prepar@@ es the swal@@ low of tablets .
in patients who are other drugs at the same time , the same dose should be reduced like A@@ bil@@ e , should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bil@@ e .
the signal transmission between brain cells are caused by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter &quot; , i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of the ner@@ ve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ ility &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ ge@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the ne@@ ural cre@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
da d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine at sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar Dis@@ patch to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , elim@@ in@@ ating psych@@ otic or lack of symptoms and prevent recovery .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ e , to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three studies over a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was performed in two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or similar diseases caused an experienced un@@ rest , compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bil@@ e was compared to 347 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ e and placebo to prevent these symptoms in 160 patients who had been stabil@@ ized with A@@ bil@@ e .
the efficacy of A@@ bil@@ e injection solution was performed in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting , which were compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psychological disorders ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the symptoms of the patients were evaluated by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorders , or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also introduced studies in order to investigate how the body contains the melting tablets and the solution to initi@@ ate res@@ or@@ ating ( decreases ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients showed in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reduction in symptoms when patients receiving a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar Dis@@ order , A@@ bil@@ e reduced considerable symptoms of less than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies .
A@@ bil@@ las prevented from up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo inf@@ ectious episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bil@@ e injection inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ doses has also been more effective than placebo experienced un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common adverse events of A@@ bil@@ e for inser@@ ting ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ idal distur@@ b@@ ances ( loss ) , blood pressure , mis@@ ery ( con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness ) , blood and exhau@@ st@@ ion ( increased storage production ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , o@@ vers@@ atur@@ ity , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxi@@ ety .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ bil@@ e in treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and from moderate to severe atyp@@ periods of patients who had predominantly lack of episodes and in those of the lack of episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol , compared to the risks .
Moreover , the committee returned to the result that the advantages of inj@@ ectors for patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or patients with lack of episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder occurs if an oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a authorization for placing the market from A@@ bil@@ e in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of smooth @-@ severe episodes of bi@@ polar interference and for the prevention of a new man@@ ian episode in patients who had predominantly free episodes and their man@@ age@@ ous episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day ir@@ respective of meals .
a increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mono@@ therap@@ ies or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ oxid@@ ation of patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
by view to the increased sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is made up of combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ i@@ ol &apos;s dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of Sud@@ anese diseases belongs to psychological disorders and aff@@ ecting distur@@ b@@ ances , and was reported in some cases after the onset of an anti@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of epidem@@ i@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased su@@ icides risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ica .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , heart failure ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions , which are used for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation disease , p@@ itu@@ itary disease ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there was occas@@ ional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole .
if in case of an AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
when a patient signs and symptoms who have gone up on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without having an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with crisis fan@@ atic in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or of states that stand with caution crash@@ es in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis who were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ z@@ ol , increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dosage , a significant correlation between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases also associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ onale or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em Kom@@ a or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk ass@@ ess@@ ments for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ otic agents who were treated directly .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , should be monitored regularly with respect to the gl@@ ucose values .
a weight gain will generally be observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ y due to comp@@ ore@@ bid@@ ding , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika , in which weight gain is observed , and a un@@ healthy life guidance is observed and could lead to severe complic@@ ations .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to the central nerv@@ ous system is be careful if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is centrally located in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines like se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remains unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , similar effects have and therefore should be similar to similar c@@ ences .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abolic types can significantly reduce the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma de@@ centr@@ ation of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
if you are using the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ier@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should be similar to similar c@@ ences .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be used together with a constant increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
clinical trials showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substr@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl / 3 @-@ Method x@@ ym@@ orph@@ an ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ rant ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ om@@ orph@@ an ) .
people should come to contact their doctor when pregnant or pregnant women during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data base for people and due to the concerns relating to re@@ productive studies in pregnancy , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are clear , the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti @-@ psychological conditions the patients were war@@ ned before , including motor vehicles , including motor vehicles , to operate , until they ensure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia - in a controlled term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ z@@ ol , a total lower incidence of incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ ins@@ on@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % showed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % were treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ic episodes on bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % were in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under c@@ op@@ ter@@ do@@ l treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % was reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in a long @-@ term period of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and common in common , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects associated with anti @-@ psychological therapy , and over their occurr@@ ence was reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ gen@@ esis , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , overweight or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ si@@ fications were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death .
although no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis occur in the treatment of an over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is probably un@@ likely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis contain a high plasma binding because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high level of plasma binding .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , for alpha @-@ 1 image and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
for an application of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dos@@ is@@ cent emissions tom@@ ography , a D2 / D3 receptor @-@ Lig@@ anden , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the putting into .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant stronger improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a hal@@ op@@ ic study enrolled in week 52 the proportion of response patients who held a response to study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
actual values from Mess@@ ages which have been defined as secondary courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions rates , showed significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol Group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ ch@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia was over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness to placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ometric or mixed episode , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a lasting effect on placebo in week 3 and a lasting effects , comparable to lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ p@@ au@@ z@@ ol revealed a comparative proportion of patients suffering from sympt@@ om@@ atic remission of the man@@ y on how lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 6 weeks with a lack of bi@@ polar or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ actions , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing environmental symptoms in comparison to the mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement period in more than 74 weeks with lack of Rand@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ ol to placebo before Rand@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ ol im@@ per@@ ately superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , especially during prevention of a return in the man@@ y .
based on in vitro studies , the enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is responsible for the de@@ formation and hydro@@ xy@@ lic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ alk@@ yl@@ ation is generated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elim@@ ination time of the elim@@ ination process is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol with extensive met@@ abolic types in the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abolic ster@@ ising from CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol there is no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a populations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics found no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin and the impact of the rob@@ ot@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and de@@ hydr@@ ation Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study at subjects with different radi@@ ators of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the influence of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which does not suff@@ ice to draw on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on security pharmac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive treatments , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gens , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular d@@ angers to people .
tox@@ ic@@ ological effects were observed only for dosing or ex@@ positions , who exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects converted a dos@@ ages @-@ depend@@ ant tri@@ ni@@ ers in rats ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin and / or par@@ ench@@ ym@@ ati@@ zation ) in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a cholesterol level of sul@@ fate as a result of the removal of sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day has been determined ( the 1- to 3@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate Con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ed , no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limits ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .

Man@@ ic episodes on bi@@ polar @-@ I inter@@ ruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % were reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and a ant@@ agon@@ ist effect on ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in a Ol@@ ch@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia was over 26 weeks , the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was compared to healthy volunteers with healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for fast control of aging and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia or in patients with lack of episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I immun@@ ity when an oral therapy is not attached .
as soon as clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be terminated and with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ z@@ ol .

there are no investigations to efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol injection solution in patients with Ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles that were caused differently than by sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia and lack of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ ch@@ ast@@ al therapy with petrol @-@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be deemed necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
research and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmaceutical in@@ tox@@ ication ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , heart failure ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions , which are used for h@@ yp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation disease , p@@ itu@@ itary disease ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there was an occas@@ ional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , mist@@ ak@@ age awareness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( ir@@ regular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ mi@@ a ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , should be monitored regularly with respect to the gl@@ ucose values .
a weight gain will generally be observed in sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ y due to comp@@ ore@@ bid@@ ding , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ika , in which weight gain is observed or ob@@ taining to serious complic@@ ations and could lead to severe complic@@ ations .
however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was compared with the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study in healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) , and the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) became in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a magnetic field blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) met@@ abolic types , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma cent@@ ur@@ ations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - Prot@@ eas@@ ant inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should be similar to similar c@@ ences .
after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ height prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .

the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or placebo in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % showed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term period of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ I ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and small bo@@ pt@@ om@@ atic patients were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects associated with anti @-@ psychological therapy , and over their occurr@@ ence was reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ gen@@ esis , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al trou@@ bles was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements of ag@@ iti@@ zation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar trou@@ bl@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms as compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean value observed from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS exc@@ itement Component scores with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the entire population , but a statistical significance was detected on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychological symptoms .
in a hal@@ op@@ ic study enrolled in week 52 the proportion of response patients who held a response to study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ) and hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
actual values from Mess@@ ages which were defined as secondary courses , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ cence rates , showed significant stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sk@@ op@@ hren@@ ia ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Group ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in a Ol@@ ch@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study at Sch@@ iz@@ op@@ hren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of valuable patient data sets ) significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 6 weeks with one of a bi@@ polar or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I fault , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which did not refer to lith@@ ium@@ - or val@@ pro@@ at mono@@ therap@@ ies at therapeutic serum , showed an superior effectiveness in reducing environmental symptoms in comparison to mono@@ therap@@ ies with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study by various patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to placebo during a stabil@@ ization stage , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , especially during the prevention of a return in the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % bigger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two for@@ g@@ ings .
in 2 trials with healthy volunteers the mean time reached to reach the maximum plasma weight for 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkey , and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment in a systematic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum humanitarian exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies for re@@ productive treatments according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns about matern@@ al exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum humanitarian exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for security personnel , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , re@@ productive @-@ elast@@ icity , genital tox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gens , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular d@@ angers to people .
tox@@ ic@@ ological effects were observed only for dosing or ex@@ positions , who exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore they have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects converted a dos@@ ages @-@ depend@@ ant tri@@ ni@@ ers in rats ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ carbon @-@ accum@@ ulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ym@@ ati@@ zation ) in rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a process of cholesterol as a result of the removal of sul@@ fate in the hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ist from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is detected in the G@@ alle of monkey after repeated or@@ derly gift from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ans was studied in a main study at which 460 women with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled , of which about three quarters had previously used a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ines .
the effect of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mono@@ therap@@ ist ) was compared with a conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in the medicine ( given in combination with other medicines for reduction of side effects ) .
in total , in the primary study 72 ( 31 % ) the 229 with ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received the conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy of disease and survival in relation to medicines .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in relation to these indicators , Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was effective as conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained drug .
it is also not to be used in patients who have the breast@@ feeding animals or before the treatment of low neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ary numbers in the blood .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) pointed out that Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane was included in patients where the first treatment is no longer relevant , more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine , and that it must not be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained in the medicine to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company Ab@@ ra@@ xis Bi@@ os@@ ci@@ ence Limited for placing on the market from Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .

in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neutral level &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ y should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
with Sens@@ ory Neurop@@ ath@@ ie Grad , treatment is supposed to be reduced to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data to the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .

Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ans can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can work on traffic protection and ability to serve machines .
the most common and most important cases of adverse events are listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ans in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of the patients ) and was rapidly reversible . leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe serious ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a non @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli drug that fo@@ ster the combination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli and the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli are stabil@@ ized by inhibit@@ ing their depression .
this stabil@@ ization leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vit@@ ale inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s convey@@ s in vitro and within the framework of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies was demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in encour@@ ages the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is believed that this improved trans@@ endo@@ thel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated due to g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ imag@@ or and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( pre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic acid rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accum@@ ulation in the area of the Tum@@ ors .
the application of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two native @-@ blind studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised Phase III clinical study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ans , which was given in the form of infusion via a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour infusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minutes infusion without medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ als .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant and 19 % due to the metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .

neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who lived in a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y degree at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y to sound in bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ans after &gt; 6 treatment cur@@ ses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of the aggregate P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute infusion of ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ans with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the efficiency exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased in linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intraven@@ ous administration of Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane on patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma displays took place in a multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ cular distribution and / or san@@ itation connection from P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic characteristics of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 minutes of In@@ ra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 as a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent containing P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Ab@@ ra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ biological and tissue coating , P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported in the first line to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .

a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in for more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided over a period of four weeks .
as a result of the vari@@ ability between patients can occasionally occur individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values above or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .

in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) should be reached by 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be eng@@ aging in order to ensure that Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is necessary in the lowest @-@ approved dose which is necessary for control of the An@@ mi@@ es@@ ym@@ pt@@ om@@ di@@ pl@@ omas .
if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the absorption rate , the dose should be kept for 150 g / kg three times per week or 450 kg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster rise is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the absorption of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 g / kg three times a week .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one illness that br@@ ittle the bones ) both in women after the inter@@ vening years and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high fre@@ igh@@ tly risk ( bone di@@ ps ) , including patients who suffered a low trau@@ matic stro@@ kes , such as H@@ infections , a disease which changed the normal development of the bone weak@@ ening .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with boun@@ ce should be taken before the first infusion , a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 I@@ U ) oral , or by inj@@ ections in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean to inflamm@@ ation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , which can reduce symptoms in the three days after infusion of symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ ies similar symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
at the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study almost 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ra@@ ins and hi@@ des were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years , who had suffered a boun@@ cing correction ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and was compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) for six months .
the main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , bone structure developed ) in the blood , normal@@ ized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial level .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % compared to placebo in placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under Placebo the risk of stro@@ kes was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip deaths 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fre@@ tin@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) in comparison to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are within the first three days after infusion and are less frequently used .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may potentially be sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ onate or one of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ians are subject to patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a the risk of ren@@ al problems , reactions to inf@@ usi@@ ons and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) in the pine .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides re@@ conn@@ aissance material for doctors providing A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the effects of the medication should be explained and noted when they should consult the physician .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended an intraven@@ ous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic break@@ age the administration of the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operating supply of the infl@@ am@@ mat@@ s ( see section 5.1 ) .
for treatment of Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long response time was observed in patients who spoke to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days , depending on the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent failure of low @-@ trau@@ matic damp@@ ening , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ derly or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular Vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion .
the prevalence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients similar to younger people .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data are missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since this patient &apos;s population is limited only limited clinical experience .
prior to the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , we have sufficient mapping to treat calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid integration of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , associated with sympt@@ om@@ atic mort@@ al@@ ia , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days , depending on the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene . before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ians a dental examination should be observed with adequate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need for dental trans@@ missions , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opath@@ ic surgery in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treated doctor should be basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the prevalence of serious adverse events reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 852 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ king Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) , the overall shar@@ p@@ ness was similar to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted medication effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function dis@@ rup@@ ting Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ren@@ al cancer ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured on the administration of kidney failure ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a restricted kidney function were similar to oste@@ opor@@ osis in three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase from the serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary anter@@ pt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , in a large clinical study coh@@ ort patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies .
all patients received adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hil@@ ation and the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoi@@ ding clinical fre@@ es after a recent qu@@ anti@@ fied gu@@ ardian , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported in the infusion of infusion , such as Rö@@ mer@@ y , sw@@ elling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the se@@ er range opportunities , especially for cancer patients , over oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ians , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections , including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients or other dental diseases .
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients experienced oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose in the supply range with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and placebo patients treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clinical @-@ relevant mort@@ ar disease , an intraven@@ ous administration can be achieved by the administration of calcium calcium and / or intraven@@ ous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) once a year for 3 consecutive years was post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ ine body .
effects of morph@@ ine verteb@@ ra@@ ins A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ra@@ fts ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ra@@ ins compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on boun@@ cing A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a constant impact on three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for boun@@ cing operations .
effect of the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density to the l@@ um@@ bar verteb@@ rates , hip and at the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly increased to all points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Increase of the bone density of the l@@ um@@ bar sp@@ ine by 6.7 % , the total stro@@ kes around 6.0 % , the shar@@ pen@@ ess by about 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
Kno@@ ch@@ enh@@ ist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken out after the third annual dose of bon@@ bi@@ op@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients a increase of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone structure and ob@@ taining the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone sales mark@@ er The bone specific protein phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Prop@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum samples were determined in sub @-@ groups from 517 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value until 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely , but most of the patients received a initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks prior to infusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to the placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and shaft h@@ als at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led to placebo for 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % and 4.3 % on the shaft .
clinical efficacy in males in the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study were random@@ ly randomised , and 185 patients received the BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fac@@ tions in men ; the prevalence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated men in comparison to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
in another study on men ( the study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage change from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at to the percentage change in Len@@ den@@ verteb@@ rates @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the output value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus P@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified , especially moderate to moderate Mor@@ o Pag@@ et the bone phosph@@ at@@ ase ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ) according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.0@@ .2 of age @-@ specific upper level .
11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of m@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of risk ron@@ ed once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results after 6 months , similar acceptance of the pain strength and pain k@@ ill@@ ings were observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as a response to a response time at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( to the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with frac@@ ture @-@ treated patients , the therapeutic approach was observed at 141 of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of patients with risk ron@@ ed patients , maintaining a median duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multi@@ ples of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data known as dos@@ is@@ onn@@ é .
afterwards , the plasma concentration rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
R@@ asch@@ al bi@@ phas@@ ic dis@@ appearance of the big cycle with half times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β is 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a terminal eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ ap@@ ts@@ h t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β is , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) , probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the differentiation of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in ur@@ ine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the entire body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race , or body weight .
an extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ium concentration by 30 % at the end of infusion , but had no impact on the surface under the curve ( Plasma ec@@ cent@@ ation against time ) .
a reduced cle@@ aring from the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 system met@@ abolic substances is un@@ likely because c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed because it is a weak or even worse and / or ir@@ reversible , dependent @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

this results in that a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50 @-@ 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function of up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is required .
for severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data is possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ true intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses were 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a 15 @-@ minute period , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , in a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to about 5 times of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ 5th of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ) .

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is additionally applied to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients , suffering from obes@@ ity ( body Mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or which are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond ( or more )
in addition , four studies have been conducted to more than 7 000 patients , A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used as a placebo compared to a placebo .
to the studies on setting of smoking , however , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was difficult to estimate that application .
what is the risk of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common adverse events of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA , which were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper breathing . ng The complete list of adverse events related to A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was observed .
it may also be applied to patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti @-@ de@@ press@@ ants because the risk of depression and among others could give thanks in a small minority of patients su@@ icides .

in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of a obes@@ ity ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which is beyond one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dys@@ li@@ pi@@ dem@@ ia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the absence of data to efficacy and infin@@ ity .
up to 10 % of the patients with de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms were reported with de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms of up to 1 % of the patients that received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.8 ) .
GE and de@@ pres@@ sive distur@@ b@@ ances may not be applied to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases over@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
in addition to patients who have no recogni@@ z@@ able risks in suffer@@ ers - even in patients who are not able to perc@@ eive de@@ pres@@ sive reactions .
some people or other close people are to prove that it is necessary to monitor the re@@ appearing of such symptoms and immediately receive medical advice if these symptoms occurring . l@@ n

the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse reactions in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying met@@ abolic diseases .
it was statistically significant compared to the incidence of placebo ( for adverse effects ≥ .1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) .

a summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Human Rights Report ( EP@@ AR ) which is explained as the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to proceed to recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can not be used in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic medication ) can not be applied . • It can be used together with another di@@ ab@@ etic medication ( Du@@ al@@ otherapy ) .
in addition to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , the met@@ form@@ in can not be dis@@ satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ ho@@ res@@ cent or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ due resin and ins@@ ulin can be maintained at the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sulph@@ ur@@ ion hard or ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s physical ins@@ ulin can be used better and the blood gl@@ ucose level has to be adjusted rather than type 2 diabetes .
for more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos were studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ ho@@ res@@ cent , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the trials , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which ensures that the blood gl@@ ucose concentrations have been lowered with doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study demonstrated the effect of an additional gift of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ ate resin in lowering H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study included in the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin at 289 patients , patients who took action in addition to ins@@ ulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.14 % in patients who received additionally placebo .
the most common adverse events in connection with Ac@@ tos were vision of vision , infections of the upper respir@@ atory ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thesis ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
Ac@@ tos may not react to patients who may not react to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or other parts , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic buyer ( high level mirror - acid @-@ up mirror - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mono@@ therap@@ ies ( at least use ) as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in should not be indicated in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited granted approval to placing Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to wh@@ it@@ ish , round , curved and wear on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , blood sugar with ins@@ ulin in@@ sufficient and in@@ compatibility due to contra@@ indications and in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data are available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who end@@ angered at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure should begin to begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or est@@ dem@@ ons , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and est@@ dem@@ ons are observed when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ ro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase of reports about con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver @-@ values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one must not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardis@@ ation range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ es are as soon as possible .
if you have a patient symptoms which point out to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , vom@@ iting , upper difficulty , fatigue , App@@ et@@ it@@ ess@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are to check the liver enz@@ ym@@ es .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be continued until the pre@@ diction of the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dos@@ is@@ ic weight gain has demonstrated a dos@@ is@@ cent weight gain , which can be damaged by obes@@ ity and in some cases associated with a liquid contamination .
as a result of a ha@@ iling ution , under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction in the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in for 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of elevated ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , in patients who received Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale twin or triple combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of a dos@@ is@@ sing hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market launch , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on a vision or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ed@@ ema with a decrease of visual acuity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ed@@ ema , but desp@@ ise doctors should be aware of the possibility of an mac@@ ular ed@@ ema . an appropriate ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of Mess@@ ages un@@ wanted events in cases of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture @-@ incidence of 1.9 fac@@ tions per 100 patient years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 fac@@ tions per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the study , a study above 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fre@@ t per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , if a patient wishes to pregnancy or who enter it , the treatment is derived ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies for the investigation of the interaction has shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmac@@ ology of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by these enz@@ ym@@ es , e.g. or@@ ale contra@@ sts , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ a reduc@@ er are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with the council ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8- In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , hyper@@ op@@ ins@@ an@@ a@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the matern@@ ity reduces the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates to the mo@@ red@@ ale growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from this data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in Tur@@ g@@ or and the re@@ fraction of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic ingredients .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ intake covers over three times the upper limit of the standardis@@ ation range beyond placebo , but more rarely than in comparative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ ur@@ inary products .
in a Out@@ come study in patients with advanced ov@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ 2 .
since the market launch , rare over heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been reported , more often if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure was applied .
a summary analysis of noti@@ fications were performed in randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication .
in the study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day more than seven days did not occur .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to work specifically by activation of specific kernel receptor ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to the animal model to an increased ins@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity of liver , fat and sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ k cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ mos production in the liver and increases the peripheral happiness in case of a ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mono@@ therap@@ y@@ de was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy , a blood sugar check ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ dec@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients and blood sugar were random@@ ized with ins@@ ulin in@@ adequate , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continue to only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin delivery in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year showed at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statistically significant decline of the album in / Kre@@ at@@ ine qu@@ eries in comparison to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mono@@ therap@@ ies with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination on type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eride level and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ in@@ spiegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years was reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ z@@ eride and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase of LD@@ L cholesterol levels while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ dec@@ azi@@ d observed values were observed .
in a study over 20 weeks pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one had not only the n@@ icious tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ glyc@@ eride level as well as to the tri@@ glyc@@ eride level as well as to the ep@@ atic Tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and anter@@ ior mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were randomised to either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after or@@ b@@ ital application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentration of the un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can generally be reached after 2 hours after use .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV con@@ forms to efficacy in about the three times of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics or pharmac@@ ology of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phenol and met@@ form@@ in .

after the use of radio@@ active mark@@ edly pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , mark@@ er is mainly found in the wr@@ ist ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in the har@@ ness ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma cent@@ er@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects with reduced kidney function . however , rates of oral cle@@ ann@@ ess are similar to healthy volunteers .
in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and ap@@ es were agreed according to the repet@@ itive plasma volume @-@ magni@@ fication with hem@@ at@@ ution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ology .
this is attributable to treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , reduced hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent and thereby reducing the availability of met@@ abolic substr@@ ates for the mo@@ red@@ ale growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia was induced by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male and female rats ) .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was investigated for a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ as should not produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is not capable of using ins@@ ulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ph@@ onic hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an@@ els resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els that hin@@ ts the blood sugar level similar to another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may potentially be sensitive to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may need to be adjusted when combined with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in packet ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane came to risks with diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval to be granted approval by Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ one in the entire European Union .
Pre@@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a fast initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ections must be placed under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
patients who have significantly improved blood sugar levels , for example , could perc@@ eive the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any changes regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin @-@ type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ phas@@ ic , long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin , ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin @-@ analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to ins@@ ulin @-@ animal origin ) , a change in the dosage is necessary .
if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ one in the patient is necessary , this may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first few weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients who hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of human ins@@ ulin occurred , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced , or unlike their previous ins@@ ulin .
before travel , to pass over several time zones , the patient should be noted to bring the advice of his physician , because such travels can lead ins@@ ulin and meals to other times or should be taken .
the doctor therefore need to consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy , and his patients always rel@@ ayed to others after others .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id must not be used in patients who may potentially be ins@@ ens@@ itive to ins@@ ulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id should have to be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval to the public transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide in the entire European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin are shu@@ ff@@ led , first , the amount of the rapidly @-@ acting ins@@ ulin must be pulled off , then the amount of the long @-@ acting ins@@ ulin .
3 If the switch to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide in the patient is necessary , this may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .

if the ur@@ inary level is always up to 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment of treatment , plaster may still occur in plaster ; therefore , patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic are still using further medicines for prevention of plaster cases .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ tran@@ splantation , as it was not studied for this group .
in the first study , in the 1 0@@ 72 patients the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( hyper@@ ur@@ ic disease ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary level was measured in the blood of the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ L .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who contrac@@ ted Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who had a ur@@ inary tract for the last three measurements in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ L .
compared with this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients were under Placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients suffering from heart failure , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
at the end , the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of ur@@ inary infection , but it was also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ act study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary end@@ omet@@ ry point was in every study of patients who were the last three month given to certain serum levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value to study beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ L and ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ L .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority relative to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority relative to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum levels to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mol / l ) was kept at the doctor &apos;s attendance in week 2 and maintain permanently about the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / d@@ L received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ unci@@ ation restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney cleans@@ ing ( d. h ) .
the AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary end@@ effective end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with respect to the percentage of response of serum levels ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with heavy kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl to 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the data collected from the open renewal study revealed in two years showed that the continued lowering of the serum levels showed up to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mol / l ) an acceptance of incidence of tox@@ icity in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a gi@@ raffe ) .
this was associated with a reduction in gyp@@ sum size , in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of gyp@@ sum up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
during healthy volunteers the maximum plasma cent@@ ric ( C@@ max ) and an area under the plasma @-@ ec@@ cent@@ ric period ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at after administration is easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking more simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in the percentage decrease of serum concentration was observed , unless this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

the Plas@@ ma@@ ap@@ rot@@ ein of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding on Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver mic@@ ros@@ ystems showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic types are formed mainly due to CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ a glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the ur@@ ine as an un@@ changeable Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ tide of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic agents and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) as well as other non @-@ known met@@ abolic rate ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the distinction about the ur@@ ine , approximately 45 % of the dose included in the chair as an un@@ altered Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ tide of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic agents and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ abolic rate ( 7 % ) again .

age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or its metabolism after taking multi@@ pler doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
a statistically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transitional cell pap@@ ill@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with about 11 times the exposure of human exposure .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ification and ur@@ ine composition and considered to be relevant for clinical use as well .
it was determined that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertil@@ ity and re@@ productive performance of male and female rats .

the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drink or immig@@ rants ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lay down after the first food intake of the day , which should not take the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 can already be used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are registered in the European Union , submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who have earned Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at revenues ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data before that the al@@ on@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contains exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digest@@ ive system ( muscles , bones , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ) , ul@@ fed ( ul@@ cer@@ ations ) , der@@ ision , dy@@ spher@@ es ( stro@@ kes ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( hidden abdom@@ en ) as well as sau@@ ces cr@@ ack .
in patients with sensitivity hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allerg@@ y ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .

the following references are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ onic irrit@@ ation and associated effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be sc@@ ured for the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , that the patient should not decrease the tablet into the mouth , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patient should not take the tablet before taking the tablet after 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor should therefore indicate atten@@ tive to all signs and symptoms that should be noted on possible tempor@@ al reactions , and patients should be noted , while the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of symptoms , as Dy@@ spher@@ ag@@ ie , pain due to swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ulation pain or new or themselves to collect medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse events seems to be increased in patients who should not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ ign@@ ity of Ir@@ rit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ages are passed to the patient and are understood from the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .

the clinical estim@@ ation by the treated doctor is decisive for treatment planning in every patient on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the patients must be instructed that they should take the tablet into consideration of a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE of the next morning after having noticed their failure .
they are not supposed to take two tablets the same day , but the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned for the planned day of the week .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and h@@ yp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE treatment before the beginning of the therapy .

since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation , with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in compared .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients where tran@@ spl@@ ant was cancelled after a year of treatment ( by example , supp@@ os@@ edly sought how often another organ tran@@ splantation or a revival of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , recent recent studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney tran@@ splantation and 129 patients with liver tran@@ splantation and examined how adv@@ ancing in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft of the body .

only doctors who are committed to immun@@ ologic therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ants are entrusted to this drug or make changes to an immun@@ otherapy @-@ intensive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences from the system@@ ic exposition of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ spl@@ ant tran@@ spl@@ ant or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub @-@ immun@@ ity or immun@@ ity .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage ; change@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close control of a tran@@ splantation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf is aimed at first line on clinical assessment of im@@ per@@ ation and tolerance in individual cases and on blood @-@ level specifications ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after migration from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es should be controlled from the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , the systematic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , comparable to both ren@@ ders and kidney tran@@ splan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , in order to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with a low Clear@@ ance , it can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s state in the first postoperative phase no oral medication allows intraven@@ ously ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate to produce an infusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
for the suppression of immun@@ ologic gra@@ ft reactions , immun@@ ologic immun@@ ity needs to be applied . thus , a maximum duration of the oral therapy can not be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ splantation rate tran@@ splantation rate should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be changed during stabil@@ ization of patients after tran@@ splantation .
dose recommendations : liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant drugs should begin with 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dose recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ent must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a daily intake of Adv@@ oc@@ raf , this change@@ over in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) applies to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ splantation After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ si@@ ves to adv@@ ent once daily must begin the treatment with the doses of kidney and liver tran@@ splantation for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant .
in adult patients who are transferred to Adv@@ ag@@ raf is an oral initi@@ ation of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning .
other tran@@ spl@@ ants , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ent patients with lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ as and over@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day , with pan@@ cre@@ atively estimated patients in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining Bl@@ utt@@ al@@ mirror in the as@@ pi@@ red area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function .
patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function does not have any influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose custom@@ ization is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ine ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum incre@@ ment mirror , a calculation of the cancer in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ure@@ x ) is recommended .
change@@ over from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ raf If the conversion from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ - on a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is be careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the dam in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of im@@ per@@ ation and toler@@ ability in individual cases under assistance of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us control inspec@@ tions .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es during the first two weeks after tran@@ splantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during treatment .
blood @-@ tal@@ es of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , dose adaptation , changes to immun@@ oh@@ ist@@ ensive therapy or at the same application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ economic concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since An@@ ag@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adaptations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered into force .
the data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level must not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ar view mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ants usually occur in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and for gr@@ ating and warm spl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance of liver cells , kidney and cardi@@ oid tran@@ spl@@ ants were generally used in the range between 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft cases or other side effects associated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage ; change@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close control of a tran@@ splantation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , proved to be proved to other immun@@ os@@ si@@ ves as therap@@ ist , there are yet no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ raf before .
for proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ants in cases of tran@@ spl@@ ants and tran@@ spl@@ ants in childhood there are no clinical data for ret@@ ali@@ ated formulation Adv@@ ag@@ raf before .
due to potential interaction , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in blood and weak@@ ening of clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is the in@@ gest@@ ed vegetable preparation ( hyper@@ ic@@ um pun@@ cture ) , or other plant materials during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ economic concentrations in the blood , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood level could be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was diagnosed as a Cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opath@@ y chamber - or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ t@@ rophy , which can occur even under Adv@@ ant@@ raf .
further factors which increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cork ero@@ id , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid loading and furn@@ aces .
as with other immun@@ os@@ si@@ ves , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients who take the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms of P@@ res such as head@@ ache , changes to consciousness , means of forces and vision problems , a radi@@ ographic investigation ( e.g. , e.g. ) .
since Ad@@ mon@@ raf &apos;s hard capsules , ret@@ aves , l@@ act@@ ose is contained in patients with the rare her@@ b@@ ular g@@ act@@ ose int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or gl@@ ucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution .
simultaneous use of medicines or plant medicines that are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore lower blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood mirror with simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to maintain the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose for maintaining even concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced effect was produced with An@@ tim@@ yk@@ ot@@ ica such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and icon@@ icon@@ ol and with the Macro@@ lid anti@@ bi@@ rom@@ yc@@ in and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ant .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics studies showed that the increase of blood level was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal contamination , resulting from .
high @-@ efficiency pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one as it is used in case of acute im@@ pulses , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us drugs can be met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which affects metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us minim@@ ize the cle@@ ann@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrast and thus increasing the hormone exposure , it is particularly careful to proceed through decisions .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long the sem@@ inal time .
the results of a low number of tran@@ spl@@ ants in tran@@ spl@@ ants do not provide information that under the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us an increased risk for un@@ desirable events with regard to the course and the result of the pregnancy .
during u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born to potential harmful effects from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regards to the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ decrease of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) .
the tri@@ vi@@ ation profile of immun@@ om@@ res@@ si@@ va can often determine because of the under@@ going disease of patients and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
below are the side effects after their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency on basis of available data is not estimated ) .

it was reported above ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ pro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin cancer in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ u@@ bility and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ zed .
the mechanism of action and pharmac@@ ic effects in molecular level could be convey@@ ed by the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its connec@@ tive to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cells .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ ent inhibit@@ ing of signal transmission due to the T cells and prevents tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ex@@ presses the activation of T cells and the pro@@ liferation of B @-@ cells , further pro@@ liferation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ inter@@ feron ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

adv@@ ances will be used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A ( a lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosing and frequency of the application are addressed in the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding associated with surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A suffer by a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood flow problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method produced as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by one cell , which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) to regul@@ ate the formation of the human body factor VIII .
adv@@ ances is a different medic@@ inal product approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , unlike , but is differently made , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe until moderate hem@@ oph@@ ilia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the disease was investigated for prevention of bleeding , as well as surgical procedures .
in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding was distinguished by 510 % of 510 new blood @-@ se@@ p@@ is@@ ans with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of adv@@ ances ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ances may not be used in patients who may potentially be sensitive ( allergic ) against human consumption factor VIII , Maus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG for placing Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy according to the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , defect , after the place and the extent of blood and the clinical state of patients .
the following h@@ ug@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events should fall by factor VIII within the corresponding period of the specified plasma body ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are solved .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the danger is passed away for the patient .
during the treatment process , the control of the administered dose and frequency of inj@@ ections require a reasonable determination of factor VIII to plasma body .
individual patients can distingu@@ ish themselves in their response to factor VIII , different in vivo recovery and have different sem@@ esters .
3 Pre@@ proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ oph@@ ilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ iden will not be achieved or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose , a test must be conducted if necessary to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be gro@@ unded .
the dosing speed should be judged according to the patient &apos;s examination , with a maximum inj@@ ections of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alis@@ ing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ oph@@ ilia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII drawn Ig@@ G Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the magnitude of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk of the first 20 express days are on the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure periods and am@@ or@@ age @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , repe@@ ating ( ab@@ norm@@ ative ) inhibit@@ ors are observed .
due to the rare adv@@ ent of the ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilia A in women lie above the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and nurs@@ ing time .
the number of patients at the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all treated with previously untreated patients who have increased risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculations ( 10 - 14 post @-@ oper@@ atively day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE In@@ fusion .
the blood of blood was maintained during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed adequate values on the 15th postoperative day .

based on the data available since the first release , the CH@@ MP has already been rated as a positive value , but when the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of security fil@@ s from A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the supply holder shall apply another extension procedure for 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company re@@ ject its application for marketing authorization of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , the breast , the brain , the bones or the wheat parts ( tissue , which connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and sust@@ ains ) of them .
it is a kind of virus that genetic is genet@@ ically modified to bear a gene in the cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which was changed so that there are no copies of itself , so that no infections can be solved by humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and to form the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein produced from the non @-@ def@@ ective in human body is formed using the p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study enrolled in a study involving the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of under@@ mining , in the bones and brain .
after CH@@ MP tested the answers of the company on which questions were checked , there were still some questions im@@ clari@@ fied .
based on the exam , the CH@@ MP will be created on Day 120 , a list of questions that will be sent to the Company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion was not suffici@@ ently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors are advantages for patients .
the committee had further concerns concerning the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration as well as safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not demonstrated that the ex@@ in can be established in a reliable way , and that it is neither common to the environment for people who are in @-@ term contact with the patient .
the company was not aware of that the response consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials , or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered action release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly is released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ os@@ aze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergi@@ es ( Gras@@ shop@@ pers , due to an allerg@@ y against poll@@ en caused inflamm@@ ation of nas@@ al paths ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ ous sw@@ elling ( st@@ oned nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is one tablet consuming a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible and ended , as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ cu@@ ous membrane ( st@@ enc@@ ils nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the most effective measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the Heu@@ v@@ up@@ F@@ ens@@ ome , which were reported in the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients treated their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary , and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
regarding the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ulation of all the loc@@ ating of the nose reported the patients who recorded aer@@ in@@ aze had a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.9 % compared to patients suffering from P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed in aer@@ ob@@ aze a lens of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who have des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common adverse events of aer@@ op@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are speed@@ ometer , psych@@ otrop@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ less@@ ness ) , an@@ ore@@ x@@ ia ( Rach@@ el@@ it@@ less@@ ness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head pain , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ op@@ ic may not be used in patients who may not be sus@@ cep@@ tible to des@@ per@@ ate agents , P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , or any other components , against ad@@ r@@ ener@@ ate substances or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drugs for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) , not to be applied .
aer@@ ob@@ aze also may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( over@@ function of thy@@ ro@@ id ) or caused a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( caused by a brain bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but it is necessary to swal@@ low or cut it into it ( i.e. without it ) .
aer@@ os@@ aur should not be used for children under the age of 12 due to lack of data relating to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as brief as possible and should not be resum@@ ed after ab@@ ov@@ ing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of the duration to 10 days , as at long time application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin has been taken with the time .
after the decline in the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper breathing , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be resum@@ ed as a mono@@ therap@@ ist .
since Aer@@ ine aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , it is also con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxide ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity for combined use of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ost@@ ed@@ rin , with other v@@ aso@@ con@@ jun@@ k , Per@@ g@@ oli@@ d , Cab@@ ot@@ amine , bi@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ cology , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , Eph@@ ed@@ rin , phenol , Oxy@@ gen @-@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of these combination therapy have not been checked for this patient expos@@ ures and do not submit the data to submit appropriate recommendations to the dosing .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ bin@@ s were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and do not submit the data enough to submit appropriate recommendations to the dosing .
patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ bar@@ ic or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or et@@ ai@@ ding of other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) must be removed .
in the treatment of the following patient groups : patients with heart rhyth@@ mi@@ a patients • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder construction or Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ al in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is required to en@@ force at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological testing , since anti@@ hist@@ amine could prevent positive reactions in indicators for skin reaction or reduce in their scale .
in the frame of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psychological tests , no significant differences between the patients were detected by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and placebo @-@ treated patients , no matter whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol has been taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in vivo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the impossible use of aer@@ op@@ aze &apos;s use during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ anci@@ es however no increase in the frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in the normal population .
since Re@@ productive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and is to be used on the basis of vas@@ o @-@ strict properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin , aer@@ os@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients should however be clari@@ fied however , that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases which can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms vary between a c@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , heart @-@ circulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ gest@@ ions ) with possible let@@ tering .

a co@@ d stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ ess , pup@@ il sti@@ ff@@ re and di@@ li@@ gence , skin oils , hyper@@ ther@@ mi@@ a and gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal symptoms ) .
these include both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the hem@@ or@@ m@@ ül@@ s P @-@ selection for endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or tasks that are connected by flies .
in a controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has not been increased to placebo in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin in the recommended dosage can cause other sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ ometer , or manifest@@ ations of a tick @-@ ar@@ ous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients with seasonal allergi@@ en@@ itis in between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergi@@ en@@ itis , and 414 patients received aer@@ ob@@ aze tablets .
in both studies , hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ ist efficacy of aer@@ os@@ aze tablets , determined by the total score for sympt@@ om@@ atic ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ) , significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ ies with P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ aze tablets with regard to the weak@@ ening effect , determined under the nose eye cat@@ ching , was significantly higher than under a mono@@ therap@@ y@@ ad@@ ine with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of aer@@ op@@ inet@@ ics , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ or@@ tic application of aer@@ op@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the floo@@ ding weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was reached day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multiple dos@@ is@@ study , which was conducted using formulation as tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects disin@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine po@@ or@@ ly po@@ ison@@ ous .
a components of interaction study indicates that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of P@@ sigh@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was the exposure to the gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ an@@ rin bio@@ equivalent , was the exposure to the gift of a aer@@ ob@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on security pharmac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repet@@ itive gift , for genital tox@@ icity and to re@@ productive treatments , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has no particular d@@ angers to recognize the human beings .
the combination has no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredients of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in re@@ productive @-@ sto@@ x@@ ik@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin was a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application was established and works before and during the product on the market .

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergi@@ itis and two studies in patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the alter@@ ation of symptoms ( it@@ ching row , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) was determined before and after 6 weeks of treatment .
further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to capture and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease of symptoms ( sympt@@ om points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease from 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies in ur@@ ti@@ aria the decrease of sympt@@ om scores after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may potentially be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company SP Europe for placing on the market of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reduce the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ ti@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience of clinical trials for efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease of disease and may be resum@@ ed and resum@@ ed when re@@ appearing .
for persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) patients can be recommended for continuous therapy during allergi@@ es .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not strengthened by taking alcohol and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should however be clari@@ fied however that it can occur in very rare cases which can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ it@@ aria , with the recommended dose of 5 mg , 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported when patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events that were more common than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most frequent tri@@ angular head@@ ache , treated with 5.9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ fold clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 as well as the inhibit@@ ing of expression of the P @-@ selection for endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered more than 14 days a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no longer pro@@ long@@ ation of Q@@ T@@ c @-@ intervals .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults Li@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no effect on standard measuring ranges of flight performance including the ampli@@ fication sub@@ jective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or tasks that are connected by flies .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the aff@@ ection of symptoms such as ni@@ otic , Nas@@ en@@ ite , and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching flow and tube of eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic reactions is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as on the basis of the total of performance in r@@ hin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis in Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us reduces the disease that caused by seasonal allergi@@ en@@ ic r@@ hin@@ itis .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ aria was investigated for further forms of the ur@@ ti@@ aria , since the under@@ lying Path@@ ophysi@@ ology is lik@@ ened to the e@@ ti@@ ology of different forms and chronic patients can become easier pro@@ spective .
since the hist@@ am@@ orph@@ an@@ isation is a caus@@ al factor in all ancient illness , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ad@@ mits in other forms of the ur@@ ti@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose intervals .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ia in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ ti@@ aria , the minority did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , did not be excluded from the study .
improvement of the stri@@ ves of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with a@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and qu@@ eness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics study , in which patients dem@@ o@@ graphi@@ es were comparable with the general seasonal allergi@@ itis , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no evidence for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5 @-@ 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medic@@ inal CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 was not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a substr@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not apply to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , with a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative and quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ ic@@ ability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on security pharmac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , genital tox@@ icity and to re@@ productive treatments allow the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine no particular d@@ angers to recognize the people .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , for reducing the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ ti@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cription physician should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data suggest the treatment of a inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory cases or anatom@@ ical anom@@ al@@ ies , diagnosis , physical examinations , and respective laboratory and skin examination should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abolic Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are limited and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic syndrome is the same that met@@ abolic syndrome .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and older people to protect against influenza , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ination that could cause a trunk of influenza that may cause a future p@@ andem@@ ic .
a flu andem@@ ic breaks out when a new trunk of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from human beings , because human beings still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; physical foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in the situation where to form a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus this St@@ am@@ ms faster antibodies .
afterwards , the membran@@ es of the virus , with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , was cleaned and considered a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the requirements of the EMEA for pre@@ p@@ andem@@ ic vacc@@ ines .

for patients who cannot sh@@ aken the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for integration , but these cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be re@@ classified , if the doctor has tested that an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood has made that the virus may appeal to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , taken with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
for children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is aimed at the body weight .
bal@@ gen@@ ase decreases in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV @-@ amount of blood and keeps them at a low level .
but not to heal AIDS , however , the damage to the immune system and thus expand the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were examined in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who did not have been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ement .
this was compared with low dos@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced pharmac@@ euticals A@@ gen@@ ase , with 206 adults who used early Prot@@ eas@@ iness , compared to other Prot@@ eas@@ ement .
the main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with det@@ ectable levels of HIV in blood ( Vir@@ al load ) or change of vir@@ al load after the treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks , more patients had a vir@@ us@@ load less than 400 copies / ml than under Placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced vir@@ al load , but with the children who had been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ iness , only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ement sch@@ mers , the vir@@ al load increases the vir@@ al load after 16 weeks of treatment as other Prot@@ eas@@ ement :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ al load after four weeks than in patients who continued their previous prototypes :
the most common adverse events of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , Flat@@ ow ( nau@@ sea ) , vom@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who may potentially be sus@@ cep@@ tible to am@@ or@@ der@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase also may not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a plant preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are to be min@@ ed like A@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , the disease should be taken , the risk of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( extin@@ ction of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activated detection ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the recovered immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for treatment of NSC 631570 treated HIV @-@ 1 inf@@ ant adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who did not have no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
A@@ gen@@ ase was initially approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the European Commission with Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing the market from A@@ gen@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ement ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years .
for usually A@@ gen@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boo@@ kl@@ ets of Am@@ b@@ on@@ avi@@ r are to be administered along with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
am@@ algam fill@@ ets should be used in consideration of individual vir@@ al resistance and pre@@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution to take on one milli@@ grams per milli@@ grams of base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ ov@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be used without the ex@@ changing of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ vi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ eas@@ ement were not studied in children .
A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the absence of data to un@@ obj@@ ec@@ tivity and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily , and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use is supposed to be used in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver function , it is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the substr@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma cent@@ er@@ ations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ algam avi@@ r during the administration of am@@ algam avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy can not lead to a healing of HIV infection , and that it also continues to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complic@@ ations of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevented the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for commonly , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are treated with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy have an increased risk for severe liver effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant technical information of this drug .
patients with previously reduced liver function including a chronic hepatitis example indicate an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ oids , which is not recommended above the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the possible benefit of treatment of a risk of system@@ ic kor@@ una , including morph@@ ing C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the contamination of the H@@ MG Co@@ a reduc@@ er and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin due to increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ to@@ in , tri@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm ratio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of substances .
in patients who are using this medicine simultaneously , A@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma body of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interaction with am@@ cel@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ tors can be changed , however , the information is in@@ sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome , especially when there are still low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of tox@@ icity in the A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inclusion , this formulation is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed in children under an age of four years and should be used with care with certain other patient groups .
gen@@ eric ase should be placed on duration 5 if a skin occurs from system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including Prot@@ eas@@ iness , was reported about the occurr@@ ence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an array of existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with their therapy , which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceutical @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders , associated with drugs .
in h@@ ug@@ oph@@ ile patients ( Type A and B ) that were treated with Prot@@ eas@@ iness , reports about an increase of bleeding including spon@@ tan@@ ans hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ otherapy , an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction in the ro@@ pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ istic infections which leads to severe clinical states or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a Multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial equ@@ ator is accepted ( including application of cork ero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ ity , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ gen@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the substr@@ ate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ s 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 substr@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines that are used primarily via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with the increased plasma body with serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % decrease of AU@@ C by Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r who can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical di@@ vin@@ ity and resistance development .
in an attempt to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma body by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ c@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um pun@@ cture ) The serum mirror of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r can be achieved by simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um pun@@ cture ) .
when a patient already takes cur@@ v@@ ature , the am@@ on@@ ite mirror and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ al load and add the cur@@ rant kr@@ aut .
a dose custom@@ ization for one of the medic@@ inal product is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ight ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increased , by 30 % lower , if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ b@@ ov@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily to prove the efficacy and immun@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ atic .
52 % lower when Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ b@@ ov@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved when combination of Am@@ b@@ ra ( 600 mg of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are achieved approximately 40 to 50 % lower than Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended that the effectiveness and infin@@ itude of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study to use A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ a@@ ero@@ gen@@ ic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ a@@ ero@@ gen@@ ic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gen@@ ase , there is at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
for the use of E@@ ight ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose custom@@ ization is required .
treatment with E@@ ight ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prototypes would be err@@ atic .
the effect of Nev@@ ir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can be avoided that Nev@@ is may be det@@ on@@ ated in the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
if this drug should be used simultaneously , be careful because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din because of the reduced or possibly sub @-@ therapeutic plasma concentration could be less effective .
if this drug can be used together , be careful ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of combination of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ da@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in the plasma cent@@ ri@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ ig@@ ut@@ in by 193 % , resulting in a rise in associated side effects .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ cul@@ ti@@ in together with A@@ gen@@ ase , will be given to a reduction in the dose of ri@@ ots in at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are pre@@ defined .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with arom@@ atics in combination with Er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ yc@@ in were not carried out but the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of 700 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r carried out daily with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily lead to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without a simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substr@@ ates , shirts or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be used together with A@@ gen@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da did not be taken at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ gi@@ ov@@ si@@ va that are known as enzyme reduction ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ b@@ ah@@ em can lead to a decrease of the plasma body of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentration of calcium recor@@ ders such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , di@@ lat@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ne@@ di@@ di@@ pin , ne@@ di@@ di@@ pin , n@@ ish@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r , thereby reducing the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug .
simultaneous taking with A@@ gen@@ ase can increase their plasma centr@@ alized and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection effects including p@@ itu@@ aries , vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study carried out at R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol was reduced by approximately 86 % ( 90 % constant interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generated ase with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefit of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ero@@ id effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a @-@ reduc@@ er , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose contamination is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , they are characterized by the use of A@@ gen@@ ase .
since plasma cutting of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ a reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opath@@ y including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of this medic@@ inal product is not yet recommended .
it is recommended to increase frequency monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabil@@ ization of the mirror , as the plasma cent@@ age of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous gift of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase may not be applied together with oral @-@ recorded r@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ eric Lo@@ d@@ z@@ ol@@ am should be war@@ ned .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ c@@ ord@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other Prot@@ eas@@ ers indicate a possible increase in the plasma body of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is administered along with Am@@ b@@ on@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored to O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ss@@ ym@@ pt@@ ome , especially when it is used to treat low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ es , no recommendation can currently be given , as the am@@ algam dose may be adjusted when Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral antibodies together with A@@ gen@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a de@@ fle@@ ction or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contradi@@ ction is not predic@@ table , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ til@@ in ) is recommended with the same gift of A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medic@@ inal product may only be applied during pregnancy after a careful deteri@@ oration of the possible user for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of activated rats , Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats that was administered by the immig@@ ration to the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding of Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the down@@ time .
further development of poster@@ ity including fertil@@ ity and reproduction capability was not imp@@ acted by the administration of am@@ algam avi@@ r to the parent .
the immun@@ ity of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and in children over 4 years of controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the side effects related to the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were light up to moderate , occurred early in early and led to the treatment option .
with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with ad@@ gen@@ ase or another con@@ gen@@ ic treatment to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the under@@ going disease .
most of the below side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which Prot@@ eas@@ ement were not treated with 1200 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evalu@@ ating from the exam@@ ines as in connection with the study medication , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed and performed under the treatment course ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rophy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ eces of fat tissue , hyper@@ t@@ rophy of the breasts and dor@@ o@@ idal fat collection ( Sti@@ cking ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously untreated , who had been treated with am@@ ort@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / z@@ id@@ ov@@ ud@@ in over a median duration of 36 weeks , was observed only one case ( legs ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients receiving 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s were up to 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
normally , skin conditions usually were mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or mak@@ ul@@ op@@ ul@@ se nature , with or without ju@@ icy grass and stood spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without that the treatment with am@@ bl@@ oss@@ r had to be broken off .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease , or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with a severe immune response , an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to common par@@ pt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ als opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gen@@ ase twice a day with low @-@ sensitivity R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and clinical changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and clinical changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) , patients were treated with al@@ tri@@ glyc@@ eride values ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , patients who received A@@ gen@@ ase together with low @-@ sensitivity R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dosage , the patient is observed on signs of a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are required .

the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as in peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % hem@@ or@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,0@@ 12 to 0.08 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as with other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment paintings - which described mut@@ ations only rarely .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) were treated with prototypes of patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical di@@ ap@@ ses over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or on :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance analyses , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pere avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ators .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m for F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 147@@ A / V / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / F / F / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a reduced phenomenon of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions of the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation pattern , changes can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to view the current interpre@@ tations for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing systems , phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations may be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pere avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ators .
companies that distribute diagnostics resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ator points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four , with a reduced sensitivity against Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples creates a certain aggressive resistant against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ viol@@ r .
there are currently data to the resistant tolerance between am@@ pere avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ant for all 4 F@@ os@@ amp@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ ant trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al patients were not previously untreated ( one of them showed a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r and Sa@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 ins@@ ulated ) , In@@ car@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 ins@@ ulated ) , inf@@ alli@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) ;
vice vers@@ a , am@@ algam ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or reserves ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and resistance of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation .
early departure of a sl@@ ag@@ ant therapy is recommended to hold a variety of mut@@ ations in bound@@ aries , which can result in the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a randomised open study ( hyper@@ us@@ last for 1000 mg / ml ) together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with lowest R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
one hundred and sixty @-@ six ( n = 163 ) patients suffering from non @-@ weighted virus sensitivity compared to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time adjusted mean change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub @-@ dependent threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ed A@@ gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , 152 of which were pres@@ ump@@ ed with PI .

no low @-@ sensitivity R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI was previously treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s altogether .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
19 Based on these data should be considered to be an expected benefit of &quot; ir@@ b@@ oo@@ ster &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; with PI pre@@ treated .
after oral dosing , the medium duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , if required for C@@ up by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered along with Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pere avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration of Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , s@@ s ) has remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the seem@@ ingly distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large distribution volume and a un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ or@@ ts@@ r from the blood cre@@ as in the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substances in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r which remains the active share probably remains unchanged .

the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ algam exposure like adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ b@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ versions than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase solution and A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ mar basis .
also , the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al impair@@ ment should be small to the elim@@ ination of am@@ bl@@ oss@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ es lead to Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r plasma shapes that are comparable to healthy volunteers under a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ b@@ ov@@ avi@@ r twice a day without a simultaneous administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase even after the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in the control rooms as well as for patients treated with am@@ or@@ ts@@ r treated animals .
in a systematic plasma exposure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including Th@@ ym@@ us@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ el@@ eton changes were observed that point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules can be used without the ex@@ changing of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ b@@ am@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ b@@ ca@@ vi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .

an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process should be applied when intensive local inflamm@@ ation actions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in treatment .
if the follow @-@ up investigation is 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only un@@ completely healed , the other treatment should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was left out , the patient re@@ treated the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
in a thin layer , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od trunk can be applied to a thin layer and to drive in the combined skin area until the cream is completely incorporated .
in these patients , there should be a consideration between the use of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk of immun@@ ity associated with a possible dis@@ rup@@ ting of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients , there should be a considering between the use of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk of interference or Gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction @-@ related risk .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ ori@@ ene carried out , two cases of severe phy@@ im@@ osis was observed , and one case with the circumcision &apos;s leading str@@ action .
with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in higher than the recommended doses an increased risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which required a treatment and / or caused by a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions had occurred at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty in the water that necess@@ itate an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .
for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly connected to the treatment with other sub@@ cut@@ aneous funds for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ n@@ osis in the genital and periods , there are no clinical experience so far .
limited data suggest an increased rate of gra@@ dients reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the removal of the gra@@ dients .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ in@@ od within 1 cm around the eye li@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ pin was not studied .
local skin reaction activities are frequent , but the intensity of this reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to severe local inter@@ actions , a treatment offer may be made of several days .
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the re@@ generation of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma should be considered other appropriate therapy forms .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s , no clinical experience are required , therefore the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicates that with large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) there is less probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ in@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of acute not@@ ions on eyel@@ ids , inside of the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the Lip@@ stick .
there is only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od suitable for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data about the acute ker@@ at@@ osis in arms and hands support the efficacy in this application . therefore , a such application is not recommended .
local skin actions occur frequent , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity of intensity or go after the sever@@ ance of therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin re@@ tre@@ ats have a big dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study that patients with more than 8 nu@@ ances are rel@@ ying on a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stim@@ ulate properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od can be used with care in patients who received an immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

in the study , mainly the safety of the pharmac@@ euticals was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the ur@@ ine and in relation to the size of the liver .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me increased the G@@ AG concentrations in the ur@@ ine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of more than five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdom@@ inal pain , severe pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the infusion .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen saturation ( accelerated heart rate ) , t@@ ach@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and cont@@ ests .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may be used to react significantly ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction ) , not to be applied .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) is every year all new information that may be known , check and updating this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is treated patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me as regards reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission granted to the company G@@ enzyme Europe B.V. An approval for placing on the board of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ ier cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ z of the Chinese Ham@@ mond ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme care in patients with a m@@ essi@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ er I ( MP@@ S I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with MP@@ S I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases .
the initial inf@@ usi@@ ble rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is wearing a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients can develop inf@@ usi@@ ons reactions , which are defined as any involvement in connection , which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion . ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients also should continue to be combined eng@@ aging , and infusion of al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical development in which re@@ inv@@ ig@@ ating equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ g antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , generally are usually inter@@ cep@@ ted within 3 months from the treatment course .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usi@@ ons must be treated with care of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with care ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer ruption , must be careful in due to the theoretical enhanced risk of a ra@@ dic@@ ation reaction after a inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medic@@ ations ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ locking ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of inf@@ usi@@ ons .
in case of mild or moderate infection , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be collected and / or a reduction of infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usi@@ ons , the infusion must be stopped , until symptoms are brought to decline , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is required .
infusion rate can be resum@@ ed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred resum@@ ed .

Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of an interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal experimental studies cannot be linked to direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns who are exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the breast milk , is recommended to do not satisfy during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical trials were generally classified as inf@@ usi@@ ons@@ res@@ sive reactions , who were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during Phase 3 study and of their extension in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years or older ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe MP@@ S @-@ I @-@ based participation of the upper respir@@ atory and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions were up , including Bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ ate , breathing and fac@@ ial ton@@ gs ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a phase 2 study with 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mostly heavy evap@@ oration and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a nap@@ kin version , with the patients at the age of 5 years with a serious delay form ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature expul@@ sion from the study ) were det@@ ectable from 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay proven antibodies before , among them 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ en@@ version .
patients with a short@@ fall of low anti @-@ antibodies indicates a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ res was able to set a variable reduction by G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low neutral effects of enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vitro , which imp@@ aired the clinical efficacy and / or decre@@ asing of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies appeared not to stand associated with the incidence of adverse drug inter@@ actions , even when the occurr@@ ence of adverse medicines are typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the grounds for the enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy is in one for the Hy@@ d@@ rol@@ ys@@ se of the accumulated substr@@ ate and the preventing a further accum@@ ulation of sufficient restoration .
after intraven@@ ous infusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the cycle and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about man@@ pose @-@ 6 phosph@@ at@@ oid recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study on 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited for the study , the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients were given by the mean phen@@ otype , only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited , if they had an advanced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where it received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me treated a improvement of lung function and the ability that is shown in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group as follows the following table .
the decline of the anticipated increase of FE@@ V is not significantly higher than the period of clinical and the absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ tivity of treatment 22 ( 85 % ) showed a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ ine ) was detected , which remained constant until the study period .
regarding the h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients treated by using a combined end point , the clinical development of the shoulder joint ( AH@@ I and visual acuity ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
there was a one @-@ year open phase 2 study carried out mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ inet@@ ics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study at 5 years of age ( 16 patients with a heavy evap@@ or@@ ship and 4 with the middle longitudinal ) .
in four patients , the dosage due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was detected after the Z score for this age group . the younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form , whereas over the older patients with heavy contamination form only restricted or no progress in the cogn@@ itive development .
in a Phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ euticals effects of various Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ es were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion , but is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two met@@ ering schem@@ es is equivalent to one .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the pharmac@@ euticals industry will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile in patients at age 5 was similar to the age of older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( other medicines for cancer ) , if the cancer has no chemotherapy alone ( could not be removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ity &quot; ( due to an operation alone cannot be removed ) and spreads very easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the c@@ iliary epi@@ thel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who were previously not treated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously had previously used other chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , as all@@ as therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients suffer from the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition , or after the administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in additionally , an &quot; anti @-@ emet@@ ry &quot; ( drug to vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency . )
in patients whose blood is changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be canc@@ eled up or reduced the dose .
the active form of emet@@ eries de@@ cel@@ er@@ ates with the formation of DNA and RNA , thus preventing the cells .
the conversion from P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and length@@ wise in cancer cells .
in a prime study of 456 , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a primary study on 456 patient who had previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study was compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which previously had previously treated with chemotherapy effects associated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other drugs against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( other medicines for cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer are not affected the squ@@ am@@ ous cells in which the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta has extended survival times as a result of the comparative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. An approval for placing the market from A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each flow bottle must be achieved with 4,2 % 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick system is taken out of the water bottle and diluted with 0,9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ re@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion with over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as infusion via a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after finishing the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous infusion with over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reduction of frequencies and sever@@ ity of skin actions in the day before and on day of p@@ emet@@ ry @-@ free gift as well as the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ost@@ ero@@ id was given . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the seven days prior to the first dose of emet@@ ry , at least 5 doses of folic acid have to be taken and the intake must be resum@@ ed for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mcg ) per week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third stop working cycle .
in patients who re@@ juven@@ ated the emet@@ eries , a complete blood image should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ess .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose of dose may take place in the absence of the blood of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the instructions in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mono@@ therap@@ ies or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should people develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must be the value before the treatment .
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients with 2 dose reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so on at the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies show no reference to patients at the age of 65 years or more in comparison to patients at the age of 65 an increased secondary risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to adequate data to in@@ adequ@@ acy and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments necessary to go beyond the recommended dose adjustments for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver functional limitations of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold above the upper limit value ( near liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not applied specifically in studies .
patients must not be monitored in regard to the bone market mark@@ er and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed cannot be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ acy is once again achieved a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and has achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose of dose for more cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ en@@ ity , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ology and ni@@ th@@ matic tox@@ icity like Neut@@ rop@@ enia , neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was deemed to have occurred when a pre@@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
all patients , folic acid and vitamin B12 must therefore be treated as proph@@ y@@ - l@@ act@@ ile measures to apply hazardous tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ static anti @-@ oxid@@ ant ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) must be avoided for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - , 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients receiving treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed is to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who occurred these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pres@@ su@@ ing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
thus in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid - gathering together in trans@@ cell@@ ular space , a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent can be collected before the p@@ emet@@ ry treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this substance was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life di@@ mm@@ ers ( other yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is not indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible rein@@ forcement of re@@ productive conductivity was noted , men should be noted prior to treatment - g@@ aps to collect advice regarding sperm cells .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ op@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) to a reduced p@@ emet@@ ry to lead effects of adverse reactions .
therefore be careful when patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acids in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding interaction potential than with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ g@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use of emet@@ eries must be xed at least 5 days prior to therapy , on day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the mind status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ums and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm ratio ) if the decision was made to handle the patient with oral anti@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ums .
there are no data for using P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed at pregnant women , but as with anti@@ metabol@@ ites are expected to be severe in pregnancy at an application in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed could not be used during pregnancy , except if strictly necessary and after careful deteri@@ oration of the working for the mother and risk for the dec@@ eit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to re@@ productive conductivity was noted , men should be noted before the treatment course , advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ ular hole .
it is not known as P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed in breast milk and un@@ wanted effects in the inf@@ ant inf@@ ant can not be excluded .

for this table , a 5 % threshold for this table has been determined under the inclusion of all events where the report doctor maintained a link with tel@@ emet@@ eries .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC tox@@ ic@@ ities that were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients received random@@ ized P@@ emet@@ eries , included sup@@ ra@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ a .
the clinical @-@ relevant laboratory tox@@ icity degree 3 and 4 was similar to the combined phase 3 P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mono@@ therap@@ i@@ est@@ u@@ das , except Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Al@@ an@@ in@@ tran@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these sub @-@ differences are likely to lead to differences in patient population . since the P@@ ha@@ x@@ se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve as well as significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of the liver functional tests .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic anti@@ fol@@ ate which regulates its effect by interrup@@ ting the @-@ weight @-@ depend@@ ant met@@ abolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .

E@@ MP@@ HACCP , a multiple , randomised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients with mal@@ onic Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ ital demonstrated that AL@@ IM@@ TA and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients with a significantly prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only des@@ h@@ ed with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients suffering from treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement in clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Pic@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ ec@@ oma was shown in use of the L@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ ese arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are caused by improvement of lung parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time .
a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , randomised , open phase III study with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( ITT n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effects on overall survival fell to patients with NSC@@ LC with an predominantly not @-@ cell epi@@ thel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate randomised , controlled phase 3 study suggest that efficacy data ( survival and progression free survival ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) .
the effective analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of the AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , a strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( such as C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) as well as chemotherapy , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by an additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medic@@ inal that can be used as an anti @-@ emet@@ ry ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because the effects in this age group cannot be found enough .
this means that the substance is the compound of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ ypt@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as Ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in ) , preventing the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines of the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three principal studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , chemotherapy alone , which are severe or moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting .
with chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of treated patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ies , the moderate trig@@ gers for nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 out of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of treated patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a regulatory approval by the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , appro@@ v@@ ise Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevention of acute nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting at moderate em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy due to a canc@@ erous disease .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding one prior to chemotherapy given cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the thick@@ est passage , patients should be monitored by am@@ nesty law or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , it is war@@ ned with simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
apart from the connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift Alo@@ xi should neither be used for prevention of nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting in those days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was in@@ treated against tum@@ ours committed against tum@@ ours ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ th@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis revealed that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , c@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , chlor@@ o@@ oxide , par@@ ox@@ et@@ in , Chin@@ id@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ ves , R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) no significant impact on the cle@@ ann@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ anci@@ es are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is necessary to be deemed necessary by the treated doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams was observed in adverse reactions ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who possibly stood with Alo@@ xi in connection with head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of survival reactions and reactions in the administration site ( Bur@@ ning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar symptoms of adverse events showed themselves as in other dos@@ ages groups ; there were no dose action relations .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably presumably no effective therapy at a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ zation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ based chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , that was given intraven@@ ously by 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , that was intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ason .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 667 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared with 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate @-@ based chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ gen@@ ic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were similar to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ intervals , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the I@@ on@@ enk@@ ar@@ isation and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers performed the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ Effects of administered in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial acceptance of the plasma cent@@ age a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average duration of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma cent@@ ri@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean age ranged between 1 and day 5 was measured on average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma cent@@ ri@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic simul@@ ations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) that was comparable to a 0.75 mg used after an exceptional administration . however , the C@@ max level was 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic cases , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ ist effects on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for met@@ abolic syndrome have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A2 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , participated in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours of ur@@ ine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered drug made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous injection of the patient the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al cle@@ ann@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function , the terminal stage exposure time and the average system@@ ic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which should be regarded as sufficient for the maximum humanitarian exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 Out of pre@@ clinical studies noted that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ ical channels , which are involved in the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ formation and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of people ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in a higher frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , ad@@ den@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors with rats , but not with mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since Mar@@ xi used in human @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results will be minimal for people .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative evaluation in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C has been suggested by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is a biological medic@@ inal product called Ro@@ ca @-@ A with the same phar@@ yn@@ o@@ il@@ i effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference Sub@@ ject &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one through a vir@@ al inf@@ ectious disease ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue suggests , in addition , values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood emission standard .
it is produced by a yeast which was associated with a gene ( DNA ) that stimul@@ ates the formation of the activity .
the manufacturer of al@@ ph@@ eon provided data against al@@ yp@@ ad with Ro@@ ca @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and clarity of medicines , effects , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference to 455 patients .
the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks , and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document , What were the greatest concern that the CH@@ MP would have to be paid to the recommendation for the placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns expressed as possible , the data on the stability of the substances and mark@@ eted drugs were not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , similar to treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ inter@@ feron @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was fl@@ amed up with more patients than with the reference to reference ; Moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test was tested in the study to how to what extent the medication is immune response ( i.e. the body forming antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not suffici@@ ently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of be@@ pet@@ igo ( a cr@@ ust @-@ out skin @-@ infection ) and small in@@ certified in@@ clin@@ ations ( p@@ ine@@ - or slic@@ e@@ wounds ) , di@@ ced and se@@ per@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for infections which have proven det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because al@@ go is not possible against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients with the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body surface at the age of 18 .
if the patient does not talk to the treatment for two to three days , the doctor should investigate the patient once again and altern@@ ate alternative treatments .
it works by block@@ ing of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ an indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was dischar@@ ged after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under Placebo said to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin bats Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar to response : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients were treated for the treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go has been detected in the treatment of di@@ cul@@ essen ( filled with cav@@ ity in the body of body ) or from infections which were proven by M@@ RSA , not effective enough .
the most common adverse events with alt@@ ar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a coefficient of irrit@@ ation .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go remained in the risks of the following surface treatment : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • The infected little Laz@@ ations , de@@ but@@ ted or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the European Commission from Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a approval for placing on the market from Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
patients with which no improvement occur within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a trans@@ mitting or heavy local un@@ ite application due to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is abor@@ ted carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections , where M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen , or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in secondary operations was the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to its low plasma cent@@ ric locations , which were achieved in human skin , or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically important inhibit@@ ing in vivo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
in due to the low systematic exposure according to patients , dose adjustments do not apply to patients when top@@ ical ret@@ ali@@ ulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ productive @-@ offerings for oral medicine and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the red@@ dish / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able in the administration of a systematic anti@@ bi@@ otic .
in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be concluded between the benefit of the breast@@ feed for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials in 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the alt@@ ar@@ go was used , most of the most frequently reported tri@@ rit@@ ation at the site was estimated that approximately 1 % of patients were related .
action method Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ radi@@ rom@@ ut@@ in , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ ilus pas@@ se@@ eri@@ anus ( previously Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial proteins of bacterial proteins of bacterial cells of bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the bonds of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ it@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ic protein L3 is involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring Centre .
by connecting to this connec@@ tive P@@ en@@ rom@@ ut@@ ine pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ util@@ ine to block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ actic , partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler under@@ units .
due to the local em@@ ency of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms may appear , a consulting should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the ins@@ ulin were sensitive or resistant compared to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ in ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults was raised 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and sk@@ id@@ ated skin for up to 7 days .
in 516 patients ( adults and children ) , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be received twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plasma screens were obtained .
sample preparation took place 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the median and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording at people after top@@ ical application of 1 % sal@@ be reduced to 200 cm2 ( = 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP Hem@@ p .
metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver mic@@ ros@@ omes was primarily represented by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out more than 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

there were neither in male nor female patient signs of reduced fertil@@ ity at oral dosing of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure better than the highest exposure of human being ( top@@ ical application at 200 cm2 , sh@@ aken skin ) :
in an embryo study on rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( in accordance with the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development @-@ sto@@ ols ( reduced body weight and matern@@ al tox@@ icity ) .

Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one from two doses of existing vacc@@ ination , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination of two doses range can be carried out at the end .
if a collection dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine is given .
vacc@@ ines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens ( &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ ination used since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given by three doses of existing vacc@@ ination times .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ an indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the vacc@@ ination is compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix introduced between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ aches , appet@@ ite man@@ gel , pain due to the injection point , tube , risk ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not react to patients who are unable to react to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
August 2002 shared the European Commission for the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ ical s.@@ a. a permit for the placing on the market of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the standard dim@@ pl@@ ural plan for the Grun@@ dim@@ pl@@ um with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a collection method is used for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ hepatitis C antibody ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as according to vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ aries .
it is not completely secured if immune competent individuals who have demanded on a Hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , since they are also protected against det@@ ecting antibodies , as they are protected by the immune memory .
3 As with all injection images should be available for the rare case of an@@ aph@@ yl@@ actic reaction according to the gift of vacc@@ ination , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary , the standard dim@@ pl@@ ema is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ b@@ ance of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ anti @-@ antibodies could be required so that in these cases , additional vacc@@ ines may be required .
as an intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success rate , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or bleeding problems , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it is possible to prevent in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular gift of bleeding in these cases .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of one separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ oo@@ oph@@ ilus influenza , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ low@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined weight m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ ps , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ oh@@ si@@ ent therapy or in patients with immune defects , no sufficient immune response is assumed to be achieved .
in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ ines of these formulation , the incidence of pain , tube , sw@@ elling , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the incidence that was observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations Ambi@@ rix was administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination .
only exceptions was the higher Frequ@@ encies of pain and activity based on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had been administered to acquire pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % with the subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the frequency of trau@@ ma was similar high ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % at the test subjects received the 3 @-@ cans combination .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ory was low and comparable to the administration of the combination @-@ im@@ pregn@@ ation with the 3 @-@ cans oc@@ ulations .
in a comparison study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Im@@ p@@ ingen the appearance of local re@@ actions and gener@@ alization in the Ambi@@ eth@@ x@@ group was comparable to that with the 3 @-@ cans combination @-@ im@@ pregn@@ ated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ated Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , during the 6- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , the vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per Pro@@ f .
the percentage of im@@ plant@@ ing that have severe side effects during the 2 @-@ cans oc@@ t@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans vaccine as with the combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combin@@ ant Hepatitis B , was statistically in@@ different .
in clinical trials that were carried out at the age of 1 @-@ 2 years were performed , the serum concentration rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
the serum rates of anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study that was conducted at 12- to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were the standard combination of three doses .
for the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was valuable , ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ational rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose material significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after finishing the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans oc@@ ulations with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination @-@ im@@ pregn@@ ated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µg of combin@@ ant Hepatitis B Surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies confirmed the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine .
the immune reaction was comparable to both anti@@ gens was comparable to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination @-@ payment , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0,5 ml .
in a clinical study with a 12- to a age of 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ H@@ BS vaccine is comparable to 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ k , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ oo@@ oph@@ ilus influenza , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ low@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ ilus influenza type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults was shown for the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ting and ser@@ rated rates as for earlier formulation .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred by vir@@ al food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as bathing in due to wast@@ ew@@ ater waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ ine , a cle@@ aring face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms that may be necessary to stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix was not fully protect from an infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series was finished with 2 doses .
if you have been infected with Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccine doses . if you don &apos;t feel un@@ likely or ill ( if you don &apos;t feel ill / feels ) a vaccine may not be avoided .
a protection against other infections which are to damage the liver or symptoms who are similar to those of hepatitis A hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have once again an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or something of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed through ju@@ icy skin irrit@@ ation , breathing need or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • When you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • if you have a severe infection with a fever .
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and usually the administration for the second vaccine is usually ) .
with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a recur@@ ring Hepatitis B surface ( anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ines of this vacc@@ ination with reduced content of effective subjects is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the vacc@@ ination series before the end of the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix was inj@@ ected among people who are weak@@ ened to severe bleeding problems under the skin and not into the muscle . if you are weak@@ ened / / your child due to a disease or treatment in your own body &apos;s own def@@ ences , or if you / your child enters into one of a ha@@ emat@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these situations , but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is necessary .
21 Do you get to your doctor if you have been vacc@@ inated with your child ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without sh@@ elling ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated with Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or if it is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated on separate places and as possible different lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Imm@@ all@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be enough .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given that they are ur@@ gently needed for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please provide your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction on Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) once a year .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination you will talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data collection , which had become known since the initial approval for the placing on the market , CH@@ MP occurred the view that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only entered into a member state ( the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this product is limited to small patient exposure .
Ammon@@ ia can also be used for patients at the age of over one month with complete end@@ omet@@ ry or hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y ( brain damage due to high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ y is divided into several single doses to meals , mixed with food , mixed under food or via a gast@@ ric acid ( through the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a Nas@@ en@@ onde ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was no comparable study because Ammon@@ ite could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( an anti @-@ drug medicine , i.e. without an active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ y can also lead to appet@@ ite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , fluid trouble , flav@@ our@@ ing , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , in@@ ang@@ ent body od@@ or or weight gain .
at the end , the Committee for Medic@@ inal agents ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ aps in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ure@@ cycle effectively avo@@ ids high am@@ mon@@ ium values .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug .
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with a completely En@@ z@@ ym@@ man@@ gel ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manipul@@ ative form ( complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first age of life ) , there is an indication for the use when applying a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y .
for babies , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with mu@@ u@@ ck@@ ile Dys@@ function AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually regulated by taking of the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and for those growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ mani@@ fold deficiency of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ orus or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an arg@@ in@@ ine os@@ uc@@ cin@@ oma deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given patients with s@@ u@@ ck@@ ile Dys@@ function as a risk of the emergence of econom@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , when the tablets will not come into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , containing 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with So@@ dium sel@@ ec@@ y and gro@@ an@@ ic clinical states only be applied only with caution .
as met@@ abolic ster@@ isation and differentiation of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see 4.3 ) .
the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and to an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed m@@ aturing of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of func@@ tionally stro@@ kes in the brain and with a disability to the brain growth .
it could not be determined if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted at the breast milk , and from that reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is con@@ tra @-@ con@@ tra at the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , in 56 % of patients at least one un@@ wanted event ( AE ) , at 78 % of this un@@ wanted events , it was assumed that they did not work with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient in connection with l@@ act@@ azi@@ acid , heavy mort@@ gage , ar@@ mor@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old small child with an accid@@ ental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accum@@ ulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ulate , which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ sing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is a met@@ abolic compound , con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to distingu@@ ish the nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ure@@ cycle can be assumed that for each gram a sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at produces between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is getting started in order to improve survival of survival and clinical results .
the pre@@ diction of the early @-@ mani@@ fold form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ ectious , and the disease resulted in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its st@@ icky tape within the first year of life .
due to ha@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative ways of nit@@ rous oxide ( So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first hab@@ it ) diagnostic diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate was 100 % , but even during these patients it came with many to spiritual Dis@@ abilities or other neurolog@@ ical deficit .
in patients with a late @-@ manipul@@ ated form of the disease ( including female patients with h@@ etero@@ zy@@ g@@ in@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ ase defect ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cep@@ halopath@@ y and thereafter remain permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ in@@ reduced diet was 98 % .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical jurisdiction may occur .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and ur@@ ine were obtained after gift of a single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis and liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabolism was also examined for cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
after a oral single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma centr@@ al@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ y , according to various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is det@@ ectable in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated with sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated with the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma body on the third day , five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by or@@ ally ( infants and children that can &apos;t swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with s@@ ut@@ u@@ ck@@ ile Dys@@ function ) or via a gast@@ ric acid .
according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ant and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and for those growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins should be kept within the normal area .
in patients who suffer from an early @-@ mani@@ fold deficiency of car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ orus or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ car@@ b@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ qu@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate ( active met@@ aph@@ yl@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ idal cells of the brain .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient in connection with l@@ act@@ azi@@ acid , heavy mort@@ gage , ar@@ mor@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ y and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore especially suitable as an alternative carrier to the de@@ position of excess
on the basis of investigations on the identification of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ b@@ ances of the ure@@ cycle can be assumed that for each gram a sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neu@@ rolo@@ gic defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical conditions may occur .
after a oral single dose of 5 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measuring plasma centr@@ al@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the ready product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
during this approach , the small measuring sc@@ oop contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient must receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dis@@ band@@ ed in water ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium poly@@ am@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare illness , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so that they don &apos;t collect the st@@ ick@@ ness of waste in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you have conducted laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you may have AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please provide your doctor or pharmac@@ ies if you have taken other medicines or recently taken before , even if it is not pres@@ cription drug .
during the l@@ ump time , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could do over the breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , tur@@ qu@@ eness , head@@ ache , flav@@ ours , refle@@ ctions of hearing , disin@@ ter@@ enti@@ ousness , remin@@ ding of memory and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states .
if you find one of these symptoms in case , check out immediately with your doctor or with the ambul@@ ance of your hospital to introduce a corresponding treatment in combination .
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar imports ) , for example , at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in chest cor@@ b with different thickness ) or my@@ oc@@ ardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ do &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the heart with ang@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with H@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ antibodies ) and a G@@ PI compared .
while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received additionally other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac cases or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who under@@ go to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as H@@ ep@@ arin , with severe bleeding , where it was much more effective than H@@ ep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may potentially be sus@@ cep@@ tible to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or other components .
it cannot be applied in patients who had a blood of blood , as well as people with heavy hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and a PCI is a removable replacement for H@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to re@@ claim approval of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ en@@ colour@@ ing ) in case of emergency use or when an early inter@@ intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolts of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if one needs to be performed in the second consecutive result , an additional capsule of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an infusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the course .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intraven@@ ous bolts of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them directly connec@@ ted intraven@@ ous infusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of any type Bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even when a short PCI procedure is planned .
if the value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of up to 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be made .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and diluted medicine before use should be carefully mixed and the bolt dose rapidly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with medium @-@ difficult kidney restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is increased and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , the ACT figure was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us with a dose of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients , An@@ gi@@ ox con@@ tra is con@@ tra @-@ inde@@ xed ( see section 4.3 ) .

patients are carefully optimized during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti @-@ an@@ ag@@ ul@@ ars ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if both PCI patients are under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most blo@@ od@@ ations in arter@@ ial point conditions , in patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment , may occur everywhere .
in patients who are treated the war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should make sure that the value after removal of treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be achieved again before the treatment existing .
starting from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ul@@ ums ( H@@ ep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ds ) can be assumed that these substances increase blood pressure .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combination with Th@@ ro@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ates or anti @-@ oxid@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly controlled regularly in any case .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra will inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the upper th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or was administered to a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease that does not process sufficient ins@@ ulin to control of gl@@ ucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or process ins@@ ulin is not effective .
ins@@ ulin @-@ ins@@ is@@ in differs mark@@ edly from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter action period has a short @-@ effective human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ an indicator for effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ ph@@ ant hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes , a lowering of 0.14 % ( from 7,@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) in comparison to a lowering of 0.14 % in ins@@ ulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,@@ 30 % with human normal ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra cannot be used in patients who may potentially be sus@@ cep@@ tible to ins@@ ulin or one of the other components or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must possibly be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may effect on the blood @-@ level of blood .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH for placing on the market of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdom@@ inal ceiling , apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous and sub@@ cut@@ aneous in the range of abdom@@ inal fusion .
due to the reduced happiness capacity and lower ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin needs in patients with a limitation of liver function may be reduced .
any change from the efficiency , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ ok , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or manufacturing method can extract a change of the ins@@ ulin needs .
3 A vital dose or termination of treatment , particularly in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic buyer ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another ins@@ ulin @-@ type or ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurr@@ ence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effects of the ins@@ ulin pressure profile and can therefore change from migration to the treatment schem@@ atic .
to the substances that can increase the bl@@ ossom sugar , the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic activity , angi@@ ogen@@ et@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , disper@@ ox@@ et@@ in , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ant ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates , and sulph@@ ide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tics like Bet@@ ab@@ ro@@ wers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and spare pin , the symptoms of ad@@ r@@ ener@@ gen counter@@ parts could be sh@@ ielded or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ productive treatments showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally the ins@@ ulin does not occur in breast milk , but it is absorbed after or@@ derly application .

heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cop@@ ic bodies with awareness can be given by an in@@ tr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of gl@@ ucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is treated by a physician , or by an intraven@@ ous administration of gl@@ ucose .
after a gl@@ ucose @-@ projection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the Ur@@ - cause for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating peripheral blood gl@@ ucose ( particularly by sk@@ el@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of gl@@ ucose levels in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous G@@ met@@ be of ins@@ ulin occurs in effect and the effect of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes , ins@@ ulin @-@ based dosing range from 0,0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg showed an anti@@ proportional glu@@ ed effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glu@@ eing effect , accurate as human ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ine@@ is@@ in has a double so fast effect of action such as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the complete glu@@ ed effect for 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
from the data was clear that at an application of ins@@ ulin p@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post @-@ oxid@@ ant gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which will be given 30 minutes before meal .
to supp@@ ress ins@@ ulin in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ant control was achieved as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if ins@@ ulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , there will be a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal ins@@ ulin , which will be given 2 ten@@ ths before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin at an age of 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 30 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal ins@@ ulin , that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
ins@@ ulin p@@ ine@@ es@@ in for a gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , that was 2 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
