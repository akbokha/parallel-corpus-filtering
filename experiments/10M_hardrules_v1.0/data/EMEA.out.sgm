<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Human Rights Report (EPAR) in which discussed the studies conducted by the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP), in order to proceed to recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package collage (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacies.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you require further information regarding the basis of the CHMP recommendations please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets (tablets, which dissolve itself in the mouth) as a solution for inserting (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirt thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • bipolar disorder, a mental condition that alternating patients with lack of periods (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abile is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes and preventional periods in patients who have been addressed in the past to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for fast control of disturbance disturbance or behavioural disorders if the oral medication should not be possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used to capture or use the melting tablets in patients who prepares the swallow of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are other drugs at the same time, the same dose should be reduced like Abile, should be adapted to the dose of Abile.</seg>
<seg id="10">The signal transmission between brain cells are caused by "neurotransmitter", i.e. chemical substances which enable communication of the nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agility" for the receptors for the neurotrangeitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neural creitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine at schizophrenia and bipolar Dispatch to normalize the activity of the brain, eliminating psychotic or lack of symptoms and prevent recovery.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abile, to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was performed in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases caused an experienced unrest, compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abile was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abile and placebo to prevent these symptoms in 160 patients who had been stabilized with Abile.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abile injection solution was performed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar troubleshooting, which were compared to Lorazepam (another anti-psychological disorders) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the symptoms of the patients were evaluated by a standard scale for bipolar disorders, or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also introduced studies in order to investigate how the body contains the melting tablets and the solution to initiate resorating (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients showed in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received significantly stronger reduction in symptoms when patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar Disorder, Abile reduced considerable symptoms of less than placebo in four of the five short-time studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abillas prevented from up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo infectious episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abile injection injections in 10- or 15-mg-doses has also been more effective than placebo experienced unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common adverse events of Abile for inserting (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (loss), blood pressure, misery (constiffness), blood and exhaustion (increased storage production), fatigue and exhaustion, oversaturity, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Abile in treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe atypperiods of patients who had predominantly lack of episodes and in those of the lack of episodes on the treatment with Aripigezol, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee returned to the result that the advantages of injectors for patients with schizophrenia or patients with lack of episodes of bipolar-I disorder occurs if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a authorization for placing the market from Abile in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of smooth-severe episodes of bipolar interference and for the prevention of a new manian episode in patients who had predominantly free episodes and their manageous episodes on the treatment with Aripigezol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day irrespective of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapies or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-oxidation of patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">By view to the increased sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initialdose should be considered as clinical factors (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is made up of combination therapy, the Aripipraiol's dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of Sudanese diseases belongs to psychological disorders and affecting disturbances, and was reported in some cases after the onset of an antiotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripigezol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased suicides risk with Aripiprazol compared to other anti-psychotica.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, heart failure), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions, which are used for hypotonia (dehydration disease, pituitary disease) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there was occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripigezole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of an ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient signs and symptoms who have gone up on a mns, or unclear fever without having an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotica must be removed, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with crisis fanatic in the anamnese or of states that stand with caution crashes in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis who were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripipzol, increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dosage, a significant correlation between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events in treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases also associated with Ketoazionale or hyperosmolarem Koma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antiotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antiotic agents who were treated directly.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus, or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus, should be monitored regularly with respect to the glucose values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain will generally be observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar many due to comporebidding, the application of antipsychotika, in which weight gain is observed, and a unhealthy life guidance is observed and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol to the central nervous system is be careful if Aripiprazol is centrally located in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines like sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripigezol, but this effect is not relevant as clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetin, similar effects have and therefore should be similar to similar cences.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolic types can significantly reduce the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma decentration of CYP3A4 compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you are using the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteasierors, may have similar effects and therefore should be similar to similar cences.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be lifted to the Dosishheight prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be used together with a constant increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Clinical trials showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethyl / 3-Method xymorphan), 2C9 (Warrant), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethomorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">People should come to contact their doctor when pregnant or pregnant women during the treatment with Aripigezol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for people and due to the concerns relating to reproductive studies in pregnancy, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are clear, the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other anti-psychological conditions the patients were warned before, including motor vehicles, including motor vehicles, to operate, until they ensure that Aripiprazol has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined in the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripipzol, a total lower incidence of incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesis, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% showed in patients under Aripigezol treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% were treated with patients who were treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes on bipolar-I interruption - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,5% were in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under copterdol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% was reported in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In a long-term period of more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphocyase), generally temporarily and common in common, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripigezol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects associated with anti-psychological therapy, and over their occurrence was reported in treatment with Aripiprazol, the malignant neurogenesis, Spätdyskinesis, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, overweight or deliberate overdossifications were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information on the efficacy of a hematalysis occur in the treatment of an overdosage with Aripigezol; however, it is probably unlikely that hematalysis contain a high plasma binding because Aripiprazol has a high level of plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol by schizophrenia and bipolar-I disruption via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a antagonist effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol revealed in vitro a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor as well as a moderate affinity for the Dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, for alpha-1 image and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">For an application of Aripigezol dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy subjects showed a dosiscent emissions tomography, a D2 / D3 receptor-Liganden, at the Nucleus caudatus and the putting into.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) in 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a halopic study enrolled in week 52 the proportion of response patients who held a response to study medication, similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Actual values from Messages which have been defined as secondary courses, including PANSS and the Montgomery Asberg- Depressions rates, showed significant stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol Group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a Olchapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study at Schizophrenia was over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a flexible or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo over 3 weeks compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboarding and active monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manometric or mixed episode, Aripiprazole showed a lasting effect on placebo in week 3 and a lasting effects, comparable to lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripauzol revealed a comparative proportion of patients suffering from symptomatic remission of the many on how lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study more than 6 weeks with a lack of bipolar or mixed episode of bipolar-I interactions, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripigezol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing environmental symptoms in comparison to the monotherapies with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement period in more than 74 weeks with lack of Randomolzol to placebo before Randomolzol imperately superior to the prevention of a bipolar return, especially during prevention of a return in the many.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for the deformation and hydroxylic of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkylation is generated by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time of the elimination process is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol with extensive metabolic types in the CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolic sterising from CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there is no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as the pharmacokinetic study showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics found no reference to clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin and the impact of the robotokinetics of Aripigezol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazol and dehydration Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at subjects with different radiators of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the influence of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripigezol and Dehydro Aripigezol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which does not suffice to draw on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security pharmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproductive treatments, genotoxicity and for canogens, the preclinical data had no particular dangers to people.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects were observed only for dosing or expositions, who exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects converted a dosages-dependant triniers in rats (Lipofuscin and / or parenchymatization) in rats at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10 times the middle Steady-State-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholesterol level of sulfate as a result of the removal of sulphate conjugate of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day has been determined (the 1- to 3fold of the mean Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found at the highest recommended daily dose of the Sulphate Conjugate of hydroxycycled, no more than 6% of the concentrations that were detected in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limits (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages which resulted in expositions of 3- and 11times the middle Steady-State AUC in the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Human Rights Report (EPAR) which is explained as the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP), in order to proceed to recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can not be used in patients (particularly overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetic medication) can not be applied. • It can be used together with another diabetic medication (Dualotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to Metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients), the metformin can not be dissatisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonhorescent or insulin, the previous dose of Sulfondue resin and insulin can be maintained at the start of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulphurion hard or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's physical insulin can be used better and the blood glucose level has to be adjusted rather than type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos were studied in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonhorescent, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the trials, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glyphyled hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which ensures that the blood glucose concentrations have been lowered with doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study demonstrated the effect of an additional gift of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphate resin in lowering HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study included in the combination of Actos and insulin at 289 patients, patients who took action in addition to insulin, lowering the HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who received additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events in connection with Actos were vision of vision, infections of the upper respiratory (cold), weight gain and hypothesis (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not react to patients who may not react to Pioglitazone or other parts, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic buyer (high level mirror - acid-up mirror - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapies (at least use) as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin should not be indicated in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited granted approval to placing Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and wear on one side the markings "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, blood sugar with insulin insufficient and incompatibility due to contraindications and incompatibility (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data are available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who endangered at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), a decompensated heart failure should begin to begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or estdemons, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain and estdemons are observed when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase of reports about congestive heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver-values (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of a liver disease, Pioglitazone must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardisation range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If you have a patient symptoms which point out to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, upper difficulty, fatigue, Appetitessness and / or darker Harn, are to check the liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be continued until the prediction of the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, dosisic weight gain has demonstrated a dosiscent weight gain, which can be damaged by obesity and in some cases associated with a liquid contamination.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hailing ution, under therapy with Pioglitazone, a minor reduction in the average hemoglobster values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin for 3-4% and hematokrits around 1-2% and hematokrits around 1-2% and hematokrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of elevated insulin-sensitivity, in patients who received Pioglitazone as orale twin or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dosissing hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, including Pioglitazone, including Pioglitazone, was reported on a vision or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but despise doctors should be aware of the possibility of an macular edema. an appropriate ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of Messages unwanted events in cases of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture-incidence of 1.9 factions per 100 patient years with Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 factions per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the study, a study above 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fret per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, if a patient wishes to pregnancy or who enter it, the treatment is derived (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the investigation of the interaction has shown that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacology of Digoxin, warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contrasts, Cyclosporin, calcium blocker and HMGCoa reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with the council (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a lowering of the AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone, hyperopinsanaemia and increased insulin resistance of the maternity reduces the availability of metabolic substrates to the moredale growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in Turgor and the refraction of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-intake covers over three times the upper limit of the standardisation range beyond placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulphurinary products.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with advanced ovrovascular disease the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazon bz2.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rare over heart failure under Pioglitazone has been reported, more often if Pioglitazone in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure was applied.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of notifications were performed in randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) were treated with Pioglitazone treated patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day more than seven days did not occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to work specifically by activation of specific kernel receptor (PPAR-γ), which leads to the animal model to an increased insensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal musk cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the Glucosmos production in the liver and increases the peripheral happiness in case of a insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study of pioglitazone versus Gliclazide as monotherapyde was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effectiveness (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy, a blood sugar check (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the patients (compared to 50% of patients under Glidecazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients and blood sugar were randomized with insulin inadequate, to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c - value reduced by 0.45%, compared to patients who continue to only insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed at Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decline of the album in / Kreatine queries in comparison to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapies with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week examination on type 2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in the total plasma triglyceride level and the free fatty acids and an increase of HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, however clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years was reduced Pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide the total plasmatriglyzeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was no statistically significant increase of LDL cholesterol levels while under metformin and Glidecazid observed values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks pioglitazone had not only the nicious triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level as well as to the triglyceride level as well as to the epatic Triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and anterior macrovascular disease were randomised to either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After orbital application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentration of the unaltered Pioglitazone can generally be reached after 2 hours after use.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV conforms to efficacy in about the three times of the efficacy of Pioglitazone, while the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazone does not have relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacology of Digoxin, warfarin, phenol and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with the cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) increases or reduces the plasma centration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After the use of radioactive markedly pioglitazone in humans, marker is mainly found in the wrist (55%) and a lower degree in the harness (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-Eliminationshal period of unaltered Pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolic rate is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centerations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than in healthy subjects with reduced kidney function. however, rates of oral cleanness are similar to healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and apes were agreed according to the repetitive plasma volume-magnification with hematution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiology.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to treatment with Pioglitazone, reduced hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance of the parent and thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for the moredale growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) the incidence of hyperplasia was induced by hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male and female rats).</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familial-traumatic polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindian resulted in an increased frequency of colonies.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the study, a study above 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fret per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin were examined with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone, a statistically significant decline of the albumin / Kreatine Quotiators showed a statistically significant decline in comparison to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks pioglitazone had not only the nicious triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level as well as a effect on the tryglypherid absorption as well as the hepatic trygimmeric synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of its primary endpoint, a combination of the total mortal infarction, stroke, acute Koronarisation, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revolving and revolving associated risks associated with Pioglitazone does not include cardiovascular risks.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was investigated for a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas should not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, where the body is not capable of using insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glyphonic hemoglobin hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphanels resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c Spiegels that hints the blood sugar level similar to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may potentially be sensitive to human insulin (rDNA) or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, doses of Actraphane may need to be adjusted when combined with a number of other medicines that can effect on blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in packet).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane came to risks with diabetes in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S approval to be granted approval by Actraphone in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a fast initial effect is desired with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injections must be placed under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients who have significantly improved blood sugar levels, for example, could perceive the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any changes regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin-type (fast-acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, insulin or insulin-analogue) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA compared to insulin-animal origin), a change in the dosage is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the change to Actraphone in the patient is necessary, this may be necessary in the first dosage or in the first few weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients who hypoglycaemic reactions after a change of human insulin occurred, reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypoglycaemia was less pronounced, or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travel, to pass over several time zones, the patient should be noted to bring the advice of his physician, because such travels can lead insulin and meals to other times or should be taken.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor therefore need to consider possible interactions in therapy, and his patients always relayed to others after others.</seg>
<seg id="879">4. hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycemia which may occur at a not sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>

<seg id="885">Illness of the immune system Occurry - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rarely - anaphylactic reactions symptoms, angipurification, gastrointestinal disturbances, angiogenic, palpitations, low blood pressure and powerlessness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycaine can be treated by orale supply of glucose or sugar content.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetic should therefore always have grape crop, sweets, biscuits or sugar fruit juice mixed with a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven relief or caused by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum impact will be reached within 2 to 8 hours, and the total amount of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences from the systemic exposition of tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant transplant or to an increased incidence of side effects, including sub-immunity or immunity.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage; changeations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close control of a transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf is aimed at first line on clinical assessment of imperation and tolerance in individual cases and on blood-level specifications (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After migration from Prograf to Advagraf the tacrolimus tales should be controlled from the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, the systematic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, comparable to both renders and kidney transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus tales are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation, in order to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with a low Clearance, it can last several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dose recommendation - conversion from Prograf to advent must be converted from twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a daily intake of Advocraf, this changeover in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) applies to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After a conversion from other immunossives to advent once daily must begin the treatment with the doses of kidney and liver transplantation for the prophylaxis of transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1426">In adult patients who are transferred to Advagraf is an oral initiation of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplants, although there is no clinical experience with advent patients with lung cancer, pancreas and overtransplant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pancreatively estimated patients in an oral initiation of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining Bluttalmirror in the aspired area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da the kidney function does not have any influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose customization is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrine oxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of the serum increment mirror, a calculation of the cancer inine and a monitoring of the urex) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf If the conversion from a Ciclosporin- on a tacrolimus-based therapy is be careful (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the dam in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of imperation and tolerability in individual cases under assistance of whole blood-tacrolimus control inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus tales during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tales of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after the conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adaptation, changes to immunohistensive therapy or at the same application of substances that could change the tacroeconomic concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Anagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the Steady State entered into force.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the valley level must not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talar view mirror of Tacrolimus in the first time after liver transplants usually occur in the range between 5 - 20 ng / ml and for grating and warm splant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance of liver cells, kidney and cardioid transplants were generally used in the range between 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft cases or other side effects associated with tacrolimus sub- or exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and maintain the respective daily dosage; changeations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close control of a transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft reactions, proved to be proved to other immunossives as therapist, there are yet no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Advagraf before.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplants in cases of transplants and transplants in childhood there are no clinical data for retaliated formulation Advagraf before.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interaction, which can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus mirror in blood and weakening of clinical effects of tacrolimus, is the ingested vegetable preparation (hypericum puncture), or other plant materials during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacroeconomic concentrations in the blood, as the tacrolimus blood level could be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf was diagnosed as a Cardiomyopathy chamber - or septumhypertrophy, which can occur even under Advantraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors which increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart disease, a treatment with cork eroid, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid loading and furnaces.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunossives, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take the tacrolimus, symptoms of Pres such as headache, changes to consciousness, means of forces and vision problems, a radiographic investigation (e.g., e.g.).</seg>

<seg id="1450">Simultaneous use of medicines or plant medicines that are known as inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore lower blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus blood mirror with simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and to maintain the tacrolimus dose for maintaining even concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced effect was produced with Antimykotica such as Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Itraconazole and iconiconol and with the Macrolid antibiromycin and HIV-Proteasant.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase of blood level was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibiting of gastrointestinal contamination, resulting from.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-efficiency prednisolone or methylprednisolone as it is used in case of acute impulses, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus drugs can be metabolized by CYP3A4 which affects metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus minimize the cleannance of steroid contrast and thus increasing the hormone exposure, it is particularly careful to proceed through decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that Tacrolimus potentially reduce the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazone and prolong the seminal time.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances will be used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosing and frequency of the application are addressed in the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding associated with surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer by a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood flow problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method produced as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by one cell, which was brought into a gene (DNA) to regulate the formation of the human body factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is a different medicinal product approved in the European Union called Recombinate, unlike, but is differently made, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe until moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the disease was investigated for prevention of bleeding, as well as surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of advances in the prevention of bleeding was distinguished by 510% of 510 new blood-sepisans with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of advances (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyreia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be used in patients who may potentially be sensitive (allergic) against human consumption factor VIII, Maus- or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Baxter AG for placing Advantages in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are solved.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years), until the danger is passed away for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, the control of the administered dose and frequency of injections require a reasonable determination of factor VIII to plasma body.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can distinguish themselves in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semesters.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Preprophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-Plasmaiden will not be achieved or if the bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose, a test must be conducted if necessary to prove a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be grounded.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing speed should be judged according to the patient's examination, with a maximum injections of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII drawn IgG Immunoglobuline, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the magnitude of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk of the first 20 express days are on the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure periods and amorage-known inhibitor development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, repeating (abnormative) inhibitors are observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first release, the CHMP has already been rated as a positive value, but when the safety profile has to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is based on the basis of security fils from ADVATE, which requires a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the supply holder shall apply another extension procedure for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human Use (CHMP), that the company reject its application for marketing authorization of Advexin to the treatment of Li Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, the breast, the brain, the bones or the wheat parts (tissue, which connects other structures in the body, surrounds and sustains) of them.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that genetic is genetically modified to bear a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which was changed so that there are no copies of itself, so that no infections can be solved by humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could be injected directly into the tumors and to form the cancer cells to form the normal p53-protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein produced from the non-defective in human body is formed using the p53 gene, usually contributes to restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53-protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study enrolled in a study involving the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the field of undermining, in the bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP tested the answers of the company on which questions were checked, there were still some questions imclarified.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the exam, the CHMP will be created on Day 120, a list of questions that will be sent to the Company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-tumors are advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee had further concerns concerning the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration as well as safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not demonstrated that the exin can be established in a reliable way, and that it is neither common to the environment for people who are in-term contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company was not aware of that the response consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials, or "Compassionate-Use" programs with advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerosaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergies (Grasshoppers, due to an allergy against pollen caused inflammation of nasal paths) in patients with nasal mucuous swelling (stoned nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents ages 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is one tablet consuming a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible and ended, as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the mucuous membrane (stencils nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medication can be found on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The most effective measurements were the changes in the severity of the HeuvupFensome, which were reported in the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients treated their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary, and evaluated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Regarding the constipulation of all the locating of the nose reported the patients who recorded aerinaze had a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% compared to patients suffering from Pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose mucosa was considered, the patients showed in aerobaze a lens of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who have desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of aeropaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are speedometer, psychotropic hyperactivity (restlessness), anorexia (Rachelitlessness), constipation, head pain, fatigue, insomnia (sleeability), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeropic may not be used in patients who may not be susceptible to desperate agents, Pseudoephedrin, or any other components, against adrenerate substances or lauatadine (another drugs for the treatment of allergies), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerobaze also may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (hypertension), hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroid (overfunction of thyroid) or caused a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a brain bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but it is necessary to swallow or cut it into it (i.e. without it).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerosaur should not be used for children under the age of 12 due to lack of data relating to infinity and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as brief as possible and should not be resumed after aboving the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of the duration to 10 days, as at long time application the activity of Pseudoephedrin has been taken with the time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline in the mucous membranes of the mucous membranes in the upper breathing, treatment with desloratadine can be resumed as a monotherapist.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerine aze Pseudoephedrin, it is also contra-indexed in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxide (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity for combined use of Pseudoostedrin, with other vasoconjunk, Pergolid, Cabotamine, bihydroergotamine or other deconcology, phenyllephrine, phenylephrine, Ephedrin, phenol, Oxygen-olin, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of these combination therapy have not been checked for this patient exposures and do not submit the data to submit appropriate recommendations to the dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerbins were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and do not submit the data enough to submit appropriate recommendations to the dosing.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or a tachybaric or of Palpitations, heart rhythms, nausea or etaiding of other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a amplification of the headache) must be removed.</seg>

<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is required to enforce at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological testing, since antihistamine could prevent positive reactions in indicators for skin reaction or reduce in their scale.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the frame of clinical trials with desloratadine, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole was administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychological tests, no significant differences between the patients were detected by desloratadine and placebo-treated patients, no matter whether desloratadine alone or with alcohol has been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet identified, so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The impossible use of aeropaze's use during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however no increase in the frequency of abnormalities in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since Reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and is to be used on the basis of vaso-strict properties of Pseudoephedrin, aerosaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should however be clarified however, that in very rare cases it can occur in very rare cases which can lead to a impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>

<seg id="1691">In a controlled clinical studies, the recommended dose of 5 mg daily has not been increased to placebo in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachometer, or manifestations of a tick-arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients with seasonal allergienitis in between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergienitis, and 414 patients received aerobaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, histamantagonist efficacy of aerosaze tablets, determined by the total score for symptomatic (except nasal mucous membranes), significantly higher than under a monotherapies with Pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets with regard to the weakening effect, determined under the nose eye catching, was significantly higher than under a monotherapyadine with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergiitis and two studies in patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the alteration of symptoms (itching row, number and size of paddles, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) was determined before and after 6 weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies were submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to capture and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">With allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius became an average decrease of symptoms (symptom points) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease from 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with Desloratadine tablets, where Erythromycin or Ketoconazole was additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study NSC 631570 was not strengthened by taking alcohol and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should however be clarified however that it can occur in very rare cases which can lead to a impairment of traffic or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urtiitaria, with the recommended dose of 5 mg, 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius were reported when patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events that were more common than placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 youthful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most frequent triangular headache, treated with 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, up to 45 mg of desloratadine (ninfold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1748">As on the basis of the total of performance in rhino conjunctivitis in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius reduces the disease that caused by seasonal allergienic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urtiaria was investigated for further forms of the urtiaria, since the underlying Pathophysiology is likened to the etiology of different forms and chronic patients can become easier prospective.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamorphanisation is a causal factor in all ancient illness, it is expected that Desloratadine admits in other forms of the urtiaria to an improvement of symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urtiaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the number of paddling at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamia in chronic idiopathic urtiaria, the minority did not respond to antihistamines, did not be excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the strives of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and queness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate this variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, in which patients demographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergiitis, was achieved in 4% of patients a higher concentration of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no evidence for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of Desloratadine (5-20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine has not yet identified, so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicinal CYP2D6 was not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with Desloratadine in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fetal, calorie rich breakfast) does not apply to the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials carried out with desloratadine and Loratadine, with a comparable degree of exposure of Desloratadine, no qualitative and quantitative differences with regard to the toxicability of desloratadine and of Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security pharmacology, toxicity in repetitive gift, genital toxicity and to reproductive treatments allow the preclinical data with Desloratadine no particular dangers to recognize the people.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independent of meals, for reducing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urtiaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescription physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that no data suggest the treatment of a infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory cases or anatomical anomalies, diagnosis, physical examinations, and respective laboratory and skin examination should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolic Desloratadine are limited and experienced a higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children aged between 2 and 11 years of metabolic syndrome is the same that metabolic syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicinal product contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with inherited problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-gactose absorption or a sucrose-isomaltas- insufficiency of this drug should not take it.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Since the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urtiaria and the profile of Desloratadine is similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadine can be extrapolated in adults on the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadine in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, no longer prolongation of QTc-intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In clinical trials, a recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents detected no higher frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets carried out in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impairment of psychosis.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, it came neither to an increase of alcohol neither a amplification of the alcohol induced performance, nor to increase the drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent disease, Aerius tablets were effective in the lens of symptoms such as niotic, Nasensecretion and Juckreiz of the nose, itching flow and Romans of eyes as well as Juckreiz on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As on the basis of the total performance of life at Rhino-junctivitis in Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduces the disease allergic reactions to seasonal rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urtiaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the number of paddling at the end of the first dose intervals.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The distribution of this restrimetable phenomena was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) as with Caucasia (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccination that could cause a trunk of influenza that may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu andemic breaks out when a new trunk of Grippevirus emerges, which can easily spread from human beings, because human beings still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "physical foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in the situation where to form a Grippevirus this Stamms faster antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membranes of the virus, with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membranes surface, which recognizes the human body as body-foreign), was cleaned and considered a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot shaken the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution for integration, but these cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be reclassified, if the doctor has tested that antiviral medicines of the patient has taken before, and the likelihood has made that the virus may appeal to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, taken with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>

<seg id="1910">But not to heal AIDS, however, the damage to the immune system and thus expand the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, were examined in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who did not have been treated with Proteasement.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This was compared with low dossified Ritonavir reinforced pharmaceuticals Agenase, with 206 adults who used early Proteasiness, compared to other Proteasement.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indian indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with detectable levels of HIV in blood (Viral load) or change of viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously no protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks, more patients had a virusload less than 400 copies / ml than under Placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced viral load, but with the children who had been treated with Proteasiness, only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had been treated with Proteasement schmers, the viral load increases the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as other Proteasement:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant against four other protease inhibitor, it came under Agenonavir to a stronger waste of viral load after four weeks than in patients who continued their previous prototypes:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common adverse events of Agenase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), Flatow (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenase may not be used in patients who may potentially be susceptible to amorderr or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the advantages of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for treatment of NSC 631570 treated HIV-1 infant adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee established that the benefit of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who did not have no protease inhibitor is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenase was initially approved under "extraordinary circumstances, as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the European Commission with Glaxo Group Limited for placing the market from Agenase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, Proteasement (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Agenase capsules for pharmacokinetic booklets of Ambonavir are to be administered along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">Amalgam fillets should be used in consideration of individual viral resistance and pretreatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambavir as a solution for inserting is 14% lower than of Ambamavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenase capsules and solution to take on one milligrams per milligrams of base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of Ambovavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules can be used without the exchanging of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of Ambamavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ambcavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other Proteasement were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the absence of data to unobjectivity and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily, and in patients with severe liver function to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use is supposed to be used in patients with mild or moderate liver function, in patients with severe liver function, it is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-Algorithm for Fosampavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V / F / V, I82A / C / F / F / F / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a reduced phenomenon of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions of the relevance of certain mutations or mutation pattern, changes can be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to view the current interpretations for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing systems, phenotypical interpretations may be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of ampere avir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protein-resistant isolators.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostics resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypical Cut-offs (separator points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four, with a reduced sensitivity against Ambavir associated genetic samples creates a certain aggressive resistant against Ritonavir, the sensitivity against indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinviolr.</seg>

<seg id="2033">Vice versa, amalgam retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor reserves; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and resistance of resistance mutations in the insulation.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a slagant therapy is recommended to hold a variety of mutations in boundaries, which can result in the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (hyperuslast for 1000 mg / ml) together with Ritonavir (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, primarily with lowest Ritonavir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-six (n = 163) patients suffering from non-weighted virus sensitivity compared to Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time adjusted mean change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, at a non-sub-dependent threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of ungebooed Agenase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, 152 of which were presumped with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Agenase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-sensitivity Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI was previously treated at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs altogether.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients included in the study included plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data should be considered to be an expected benefit of "irbooster" Agenase "with PI pretreated.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the medium duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of Ambamavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, if required for Cup by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered along with Ambamavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ampere avir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambamavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration of Steady State (Cmin, ss) has remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seemingly distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be close to a large distribution volume and a unhindered penetration of amortsr from the blood creas in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substances in plasma, with the amount of unbound Ambamavir which remains the active share probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Ambamavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient in dependence of the overall doctor's concentration in Steady-State across the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore there must be pharmaceuticals, the CYP3A4 induce or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution when they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amalgam exposure like adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambavir is made from the solution 14% less biversions than from the capsules; therefore, Agenase solution and Agenase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammar basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal cleance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal impairment should be small to the elimination of amblossr and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to Ambamavir plasma shapes that are comparable to healthy volunteers under a dose of 1200 mg of Ambovavir twice a day without a simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for canoogenicity in mice and rats appeared in male animals benigne hepatoma patients with doses above the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8 times (mock) of exposure to humans, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of amboavir, corresponded.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatoma cells and carcinomas has not been resolved and the relevance of these observed effects for men is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both of clinical trials as well as from therapeutic use, however, however, some hints for accepting a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxic tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Amit Test), mouse-lymphoma test, microcore test of rats and chromosomes after human lymphocytes changed, was Ambamavir neither mutagenic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life through measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far, no significant liver toxicity in patients were observed, neither during the administration of Agenase even after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young, which were treated with an age of 4 days, showed high mortality in the control rooms as well as for patients treated with amortsr treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic plasma exposure, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including Thymuselongation and minor skeleton changes were observed that point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules can be used without the exchanging of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg of Ambamavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Ambcavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous application should be used in patients with weak or light liver function with caution when patients with severe liver function is contra-indexed (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the pharmaceuticals was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured in relation to the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme increased the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children had a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of more than five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, severe pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (accelerated heart rate), tachometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and contests.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Alduracyme may be used to react significantly (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is every year all new information that may be known, check and updating this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is treated patients who observe Alduracyme as regards reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission granted to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. An approval for placing on the board of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using Cho-mammier cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierz of the Chinese Hammond).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme care in patients with a messiysaccharier I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with alduracyme should take place by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusible rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient is wearing a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">Safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients with Aldurazyme treated patients can develop infusions reactions, which are defined as any involvement in connection, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion. (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients also should continue to be combined engaging, and infusion of alduracyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical development in which reinvigating equipment for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients Igg antibodies against Laronidase, generally are usually intercepted within 3 months from the treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusions must be treated with care of aldurazyme with care (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer ruption, must be careful in due to the theoretical enhanced risk of a radication reaction after a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or anti-locking) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infection, treatment with antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be collected and / or a reduction of infusion rate to the half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusions, the infusion must be stopped, until symptoms are brought to decline, a treatment with antihistamines and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen is required.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion rate can be resumed on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (Antihistamine and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen / Ibuprofen and / or Corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the past reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Alduracyme should not be used at the same time with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of an interference with the intracellular absorption of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies cannot be linked to direct or indirect harmful effects to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data to newborns who are exposed to Laronidase over the breast milk, is recommended to do not satisfy during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were generally classified as infusionsressive reactions, who were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme that were observed during Phase 3 study and of their extension in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years or older (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-based participation of the upper respiratory and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions were up, including Bronchospate, breathing and facial tongs (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, who were reported during a phase 2 study with 20 patients at the age of 5, with mostly heavy evaporation and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a napkin version, with the patients at the age of 5 years with a serious delay form (average after 26 days compared to 45 days at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature expulsion from the study) were detectable from 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay proven antibodies before, among them 3 patients who never came to Serenversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a shortfall of low anti-antibodies indicates a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in Harn, while in patients with high antibody titres was able to set a variable reduction by GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutral effects of enzymatic laronidas- activity in vitro, which impaired the clinical efficacy and / or decreasing of GAG in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies appeared not to stand associated with the incidence of adverse drug interactions, even when the occurrence of adverse medicines are typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The grounds for the enzymatic therapy is in one for the Hydrolysse of the accumulated substrate and the preventing a further accumulation of sufficient restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the cycle and cells into the Lysosomes, most likely about manpose-6 phosphatoid receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study on 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the entire disease spectrum, the majority of the patients were given by the mean phenotype, only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited, if they had an advanced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where it received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg of Alduracyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Alduracyme treated a improvement of lung function and the ability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Alduracyme / Alduracyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Alduracyme group as follows the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline of the anticipated increase of FEV is not significantly higher than the period of clinical and the absolute lung-volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a heptivity of treatment 22 (85%) showed a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatine) was detected, which remained constant until the study period.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients treated by using a combined end point, the clinical development of the shoulder joint (AHI and visual acuity) was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one-year open phase 2 study carried out mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study at 5 years of age (16 patients with a heavy evaporship and 4 with the middle longitudinal).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage due to increased GAG- mirror in Harn in week 22 was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was detected after the Z score for this age group. the younger patients with the mean follow-up form, whereas over the older patients with heavy contamination form only restricted or no progress in the cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study, investigations into pharmaceuticals effects of various Alduracyme metering schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute test test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously every week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusion, but is not demonstrated that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two metering schemes is equivalent to one.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the pharmaceuticals industry will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients at age 5 was similar to the age of older and less affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, a strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cisplatin) as well as chemotherapy, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (like Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by an additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicinal that can be used as an anti-emetry).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because the effects in this age group cannot be found enough.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance is the compound of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as Serotonin), preventing the receptors in the intestines of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi has been studied in three principal studies at 1 842 adults, chemotherapy alone, which are severe or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">With chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of treated patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi were treated in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 out of 189), compared to 69% of treated patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolassetron, these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolassetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a regulatory approval by the European Commission of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., approvise Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy for prevention of nausea and vomiting at moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancerous disease.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be amplified by adding one prior to chemotherapy given corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the thickest passage, patients should be monitored by amnesty law or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Like with other 5HT3 antagonists, it is warned with simultaneous gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT- interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Apart from the connection with another chemotherapeutics gift Aloxi should neither be used for prevention of nausea and vomiting in those days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron was intreated against tumours committed against tumours (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cythabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-static metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population based pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (Amiodaron, coxetine, chlorooxide, paroxetin, Chinidine, ranitives, Ritonavir, Sertralin and Terbinafin) no significant impact on the cleannance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is necessary to be deemed necessary by the treated doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms was observed in adverse reactions (a total of 633 patients), who possibly stood with Aloxi in connection with headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of survival reactions and reactions in the administration site (Burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar symptoms of adverse events showed themselves as in other dosages groups; there were no dose action relations.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis probably presumably no effective therapy at a Aloxi- overdozation.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate-based chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-time 7.3 hours), that was given intravenously by 32 mg of Ondansetron (half-time 7.3 hours), that was intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasason.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared with 32 mg of Ondansetron, were given intravenously on Day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate-based chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were similar to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the QTc-intervals, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolassetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron owns the ability to block the Ionenkarisation and Repolarisation, and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers performed the evaluation of the ECG-Effects of administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial acceptance of the plasma centage a slow elimination from the body with an average duration of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma centriation (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the total dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean age ranged between 1 and day 5 was measured on average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma centriation at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) that was comparable to a 0.75 mg used after an exceptional administration. however, the Cmax level was 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolic cases, compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of the antagonist effects on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolic syndrome have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, CYP3A2 and CYP1A2, participated in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered drug made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous injection of the patient the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal cleannance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function, the terminal stage exposure time and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which should be regarded as sufficient for the maximum humanitarian exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies noted that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionical channels, which are involved in the ventricular deformation and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of people), which were given daily over two years, resulted in a higher frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasmen (thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, addenerenmark) and skin tumors with rats, but not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and since Marxi used in human-time application, the relevance of these results will be minimal for people.</seg>

<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document, What were the greatest concern that the CHMP would have to be paid to the recommendation for the placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns expressed as possible, the data on the stability of the substances and marketed drugs were not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, similar to treatment with alpheon and Rointerferon-A, was similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was flamed up with more patients than with the reference to reference; Moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test was tested in the study to how to what extent the medication is immune response (i.e. the body forming antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of bepetigo (a crust-out skin-infection) and small incertified inclinations (pine- or slicewounds), diced and sepered wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for infections which have proven detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because algo is not possible against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients with the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the body surface at the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not talk to the treatment for two to three days, the doctor should investigate the patient once again and alternate alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking of bacterial ribosomes (the parts of bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indian indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies in the proportion of patients whose infection was discharged after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under Placebo said to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin bats Altargo and Cefalexin similar to response: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of the patients were treated for the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo has been detected in the treatment of diculessen (filled with cavity in the body of body) or from infections which were proven by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common adverse events with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a coefficient of irritation.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo remained in the risks of the following surface treatment: • Impetigo, • The infected little Lazations, debutted or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the European Commission from Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for placing on the market from Altargo to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which no improvement occur within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a transmitting or heavy local unite application due to the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is aborted carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections, where MRSA is known as pathogen, or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials in secondary operations was the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections which were caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered, if after a 2-3 day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to its low plasma centric locations, which were achieved in human skin, or infected surface wounds, a clinically important inhibiting in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In due to the low systematic exposure according to patients, dose adjustments do not apply to patients when topical retaliulin is applied during a systematic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive-offerings for oral medicine and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the reddish / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the application of Retapamulin is preferable in the administration of a systematic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In the decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be concluded between the benefit of the breastfeed for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials in 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the altargo was used, most of the most frequently reported triritation at the site was estimated that approximately 1% of patients were related.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Action method Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pradiromutin, a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeerianus (previously Pleurotus passeerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial proteins of bacterial proteins of bacterial cells of bacterial ribosomes, which differs from the bonds of other ribosomal interagitating antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the ribosomic protein L3 is involved in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the Peptidyltransferring Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By connecting to this connective Penromutine peptidylutiline to block the peptidylactic, partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education active 50s ribosomaler underunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local emency of resistance the application of Retapamulin at least some infection forms may appear, a consulting should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of Retapamulin at S.aureus, regardless of whether the insulin were sensitive or resistant compared to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment of S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults was raised 1% Retapamulin Salbe daily under occlusion on intact and skidated skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">In 516 patients (adults and children), 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds, individual plasma screens were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sample preparation took place 3 or 4 in adult patients in front of the median and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording at people after topical application of 1% salbe reduced to 200 cm2 (= 0-24) = 238 ng / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP Hemp.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative Metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily represented by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out more than 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on genmutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test, respectively, of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-microcore in the in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither in male nor female patient signs of reduced fertility at oral dosing of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, making up to 5 times higher exposure better than the highest exposure of human being (topical application at 200 cm2, shaken skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryo study on rats were ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (in accordance with the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above), development-stools (reduced body weight and maternal toxicity).</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must make sure a pharmaceutical-impanzee system is present, as shown in the 1.8.1 application of the application (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed and used as long as the marketable product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the placing on the market is obliged to perform detailed information and additional pharmaceutical activities, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and as described in the 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all the additional alizations of the RMP, agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use," the updated RMP is to be submitted to the next periodically Safety update Report as at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point should display the application of Altargo and speak with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other sage, creams or lotional on an area that is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly outlined by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It cannot be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the sage leaves on one of these areas, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor if it appear.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After carrying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gazing association, unless your doctor has come to cover the area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of one from two doses of existing vaccination, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after administration the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and it is ensured that the vaccination of two doses range can be carried out at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a collection dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine is given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens ("foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccination of Twinrix adults and the vaccination used since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are given by three doses of existing vaccination times.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that the application of Twinrix adults were also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indian indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the vaccination is compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix introduced between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headaches, appetite mangel, pain due to the injection point, tube, risk (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not react to patients who are unable to react to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 shared the European Commission for the company GlaxoSmithKline Biological s.a. a permit for the placing on the market of Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard dimplural plan for the Grundimplum with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the appointment of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a collection method is used for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis C antibody (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size as according to vaccination with the respective monovaries.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely secured if immune competent individuals who have demanded on a Hepatitis A vaccination, since they are also protected against detecting antibodies, as they are protected by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection images should be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction according to the gift of vaccination, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standard dimplema is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units formininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">For hematalysis patients and persons with disturbance of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBS anti-anti-antibodies could be required so that in these cases, additional vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">As an intraoral injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success rate, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">With Thrombozytopenia or bleeding problems, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneous, since it is possible to prevent intramuscular gift of bleeding in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of one separate injection, Tetanus-, azooophilus influenza, inactivated poliomyellow- and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined weight mummumps, the immune response was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunohsient therapy or in patients with immune defects, no sufficient immune response is assumed to be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccines of these formulation, the incidence of pain, tube, swelling, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable with the incidence that was observed in earlier thiomerang and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations Ambirix was administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions was the higher Frequencies of pain and activity based on a calculation basis per vaccination Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle reported 66.4% of the subjects who had been administered to acquire pain, compared to 63.8% with the subjects who have been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of trauma was similar high (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% at the test subjects received the 3-cans combination.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and matory was low and comparable to the administration of the combination-impregnation with the 3-cans oculations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study at 1-11-year-old Impingen the appearance of local reactions and generalization in the Ambiethxgroup was comparable to that with the 3-cans combination-impregnated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinated Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, during the 6- to 11-year-olds, the vaccination with Ambirix was reported a common occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per Prof.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of implanting that have severe side effects during the 2-cans octines with Ambirix or during the 3-cans vaccine as with the combined hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of combinant Hepatitis B, was statistically indifferent.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out at the age of 1-2 years were performed, the serum concentration rates for anti-HAV 99.1% had a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates of anti-HBS were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e., in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study that was conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were the standard combination of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people whose immunity was valuable, seroprotational rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-dose material significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were achieved in a clinical study at 1-11-year-old one month after finishing the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-cans oculations with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccine with a combination-impregnated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of combinant Hepatitis B Surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies confirmed the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction was comparable to both antigens was comparable to vaccination of 3 doses with a combination-payment, consisting of 360 ELISA units formininactivated hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study with a 12- to a age of 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS anti-HBS anti-HBS anti-HBS anti-HBS vaccine is comparable to 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was given in the second year of a combined diphtherik, tetanus-, azooophilus influenza, inactivated poliomyellow- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults was shown for the current formulation of similar seroprotting and serrated rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both pre-exploded as well as after the Resuspense per sight on any other particles and / or physicalically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a clearing face, yellow skin and / or eyes (yellow) and other symptoms that may be necessary to stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix was not fully protect from an infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series was finished with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you have been infected with Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccine doses. if you don't feel unlikely or ill (if you don't feel ill / feels) a vaccine may not be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections which are to damage the liver or symptoms who are similar to those of hepatitis A hepatitis B infection can not be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have once again an allergic reaction to Ambirix or something of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed through juicy skin irritation, breathing need or swelling of the face or tongue. • When you have occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • if you have a severe infection with a fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and usually the administration for the second vaccine is usually).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recurring Hepatitis B surface (antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccines of this vaccination with reduced content of effective subjects is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection against the vaccination series before the end of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix was injected among people who are weakened to severe bleeding problems under the skin and not into the muscle. if you are weakened / / your child due to a disease or treatment in your own body's own defences, or if you / your child enters into one of a haematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these situations, but the immune response of these individuals can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Do you get to your doctor if you have been vaccinated with your child (including those who have been vaccinated without shelling) or if you have been vaccinated with Immunoglobuline (antibodies), or if it is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated on separate places and as possible different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after injection of Immalllobuline, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be enough.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or lactating women is not given that they are urgently needed for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please provide your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction on Neomycin (antibiotic) once a year.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data collection, which had become known since the initial approval for the placing on the market, CHMP occurred the view that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only entered into a member state (the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this product is limited to small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used for patients at the age of over one month with complete endometry or hyperammonic Encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonium concentration) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammony is divided into several single doses to meals, mixed with food, mixed under food or via a gastric acid (through the stomach-leading hose) or a Nasenonde (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was no comparable study because Ammonite could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (an anti-drug medicine, i.e. without an active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammony can also lead to appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fluid trouble, flavouring, nausea, constipation, skin rash, inangent body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">At the end, the Committee for Medicinal agents (CHMP) came to the conclusion that amaps in patients with disruptions of the urecycle effectively avoids high ammonium values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed in all patients with a completely Enzymmangel (within the first 28 life days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manipulative form (complete Enzymdefective, which manifests itself after the first age of life), there is an indication for the use when applying a hyperammonic Encephalopathy.</seg>

<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early-manifold form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was previously almost always infectious, and the disease resulted in treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with its sticky tape within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hadialysis, the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrous oxide (Sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (however within the first habit) diagnostic diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients the survival rate was 100%, but even during these patients it came with many to spiritual Disabilities or other neurological deficit.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute Koronardromes" (ACS, reduced blood sugar imports), for example, at instabiler Angina (a form of pain in chest corb with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "ST- Hebdo" (an anomalous measuring value at the electrocardiac or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is applied to prevent blood clots in patients receiving a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the heart with angina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-antibodies) and a GPI compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a closure) and they received additionally other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, cardiac cases or Revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo to a PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, with severe bleeding, where it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>

<seg id="2966">Apidra will injected subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, injected the upper thighs or the upper arm or was administered to a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease that does not process sufficient insulin to control of glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or process insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-insisin differs markedly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter action period has a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indian indicator for effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glyphant hemoglobin hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes, a lowering of 0.14% (from 7,60% to 7.46%) in comparison to a lowering of 0.14% in insulin-lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0,30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra cannot be used in patients who may potentially be susceptible to insulin or one of the other components or in patients who suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must possibly be adjusted when it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may effect on the blood-level of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for placing on the market of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the field of abdominal ceiling, apply or subcutaneous and subcutaneous in the range of abdominal fusion.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced happiness capacity and lower insulin delivery, the insulin needs in patients with a limitation of liver function may be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change from the efficiency, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinok, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or manufacturing method can extract a change of the insulin needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A vital dose or termination of treatment, particularly in patients with a insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic buyer; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another insulin-type or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effects of the insulin pressure profile and can therefore change from migration to the treatment schematic.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that can increase the blossom sugar, the antidiabetic activity, angiogenetin-converting enzyme (ACE) -Hemmer, disperoxetin, monoamine oxidant (MAO) inhibitor, pentoxifylline, Propoxypha, salicylates, and sulphide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics like Betabrowers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and spare pin, the symptoms of adrenergen counterparts could be shielded or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies for reproductive treatments showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humaninsulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin pulin occurs in human breast milk, but generally the insulin does not occur in breast milk, but it is absorbed after orderly application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">In the following are they listed in clinical trials, grouped according to system organs and ordered by declining frequencies of their essay (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare (frequency on the same bathe data are not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - silence, cool and flaming skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual bleeding or bruising, ability, alteration of vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy will fail to change the injection nozzle within the injection area, may occur in the sequence of a lipodystrophy in the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Heavy hypoglycopic bodies with awareness can be given by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), which is treated by a physician, or by an intravenous administration of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose-projection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the Ur- cause for the heavy hypoglycaemia and similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral blood glucose (particularly by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose levels in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous Gmetbe of insulin occurs in effect and the effect of action is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin-based dosing range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed an antiproportional glued effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glueing effect, accurate as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin pineisin has a double so fast effect of action such as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glued effect for 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was clear that at an application of insulin pulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post-oxidant glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which will be given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">To suppress insulin in 2 minutes before meal, a better postpant control was achieved as with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, there will be a comparable glycaemic control as with human normal insulin, which will be given 2 tenths before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin at an age of 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, that was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin pineesin for a gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human Nor- malinsulin, that was 2 minutes before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
