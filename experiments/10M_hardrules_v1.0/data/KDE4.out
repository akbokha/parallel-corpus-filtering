the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 currently used for digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free @-@ capable software collection for digital cameras supporting a constantly increasing protocol that has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for your communication with the computer . da photos in general are large files and transmission via the serial port is slowly , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete and supports the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found in this link .
lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . the EX@@ IF support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera support , if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photoelectric 2 , you will be able to see any other images or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to print &amp; goes ; is how easy the functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; fix@@ tures ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ ma . the objective is to provide the modules of all the graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is considerably easier , &amp; fix@@ tures ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ plug .

select one or more images from any view inside the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light table add to the context menu . when you come back in &amp; digi@@ plug , the selection will be open , you can quickly open the light desk quickly with L extr@@ as .
you can choose the pictures you want to compare it in the left or right area of the window . if you can preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and watch them on one of the pictures , then you will also compare these pictures in the other image . you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to view a photo series . if you are using pairs of tool@@ bar , the two first pictures will automatically display in the areas of loading . the right of the right image will be displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies the right of view through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal soldering actions are also working directly from the light , such as F4 file ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both pictures in the light . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the lower end of each range you can see a built @-@ in swi@@ v@@ elling function which you can be seen at the crossed path . in order to hold the visible spectrum of the image , you must click here and see the &amp; L@@ MB . in the same mode , both pictures will show the same image .

what is a digital building management - away from the Mo@@ de@@ word ? digital stock covers any part of the process after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos decreases , sc@@ anned or digital photos creates a form of digital evaluation . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips for you to get back , protecting and print photos . we look at the procedures for digital photography the &amp; digi@@ plug . we consider the download , ren@@ ame , secure , evaluate , evaluate , optim@@ ise , optimi@@ zing , optimi@@ zing , and export images files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock covers , inde@@ xed , categorized , search@@ able , trans@@ duc@@ ed , conf@@ ection@@ ate , conf@@ ected , exports and exports to a mon@@ ary or cultural value hab@@ it@@ s.@@ quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined in accordance with your definition data , which provide information on or a documentation of other data provided by application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you &apos;ll do not need to know how many photos you don &apos;t need to store your database as well as in the image files are guaranteed very fast search and a secure archi@@ ving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats free .
the first thing you need to do and know any thing to your system is the structure information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide whether you want to save your videos on your computer , whether you want to save them on a anywhere drive , or on a network work &amp; etc . make sure you need to change to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly via your storage location . if you were able to organize enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a web page .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures at different themes and a great number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be re @-@ organizing your structure for this content .
which types of files fit ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . split new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies the backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; fix@@ tures ; this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database by selecting the corresponding item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what will change ? you can make a met@@ ad@@ ata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now you start the real work as you need to show any photo words , label and rating . of course you can select all the pictures you need the same attri@@ bute . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos when working on the best photos .
let us now proceed with keywords , keywords , how you continue in other programs frequently called or proceed categories . all three are syn@@ onym@@ s for the same thing .
if you import the kat@@ alog@@ ized images from another source with embedded sample , then drag the pictures to the correct place . the um@@ sor@@ ting of Hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by removing a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed key@@ words are taken by &amp; screw@@ ed ; updated while the sub @-@ trees are persecuted .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata are over@@ cut . this is a very gross representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all pictures .
enough of the words - the next section refers to label or comments , the third important tool to catalog@@ ing your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you want to see most of your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from afar off is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this of the landing area of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y , 60 years after landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , remin@@ ders , the historical period of time , you may even hear the silence . the label has changed your perception of this panorama .
for other photos look at the title perhaps more important than the picture itself is maybe more important than the picture itself . if you show pictures you should tell a story about it , To help Him about the motif that you move on the motif that you can understand what you understand .
it is okay when a picture is not perfect when the strength is only able to work alone with a label .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can also use a lot of text in an international@@ ised alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . then you can even export your images into web galleries . then you will see this label according to your wishes into the label and / or the title of web sites . you must tell the story here for a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a bor@@ ing planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ al@@ izing are already inn@@ able and are still inn@@ able in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can also open your travels across pictures with geographical data . this also shows the photos at the recording location . you can also export the pictures at Gall@@ ery@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with Google Earth view .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a voc@@ alist with copyright and designated the practice of using the cop@@ y@@ rights to remove limitations on distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also in all amended versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description says that information contained in the setup site of &amp; fix@@ tures ; when information should be deposited :
author ( Syn@@ onym for Cre@@ ators and W@@ rit@@ er ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . if this value has been stored once , it should not be changed once . this field does not support the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ an ( Syn@@ onym for W@@ rit@@ z ) : linked with the author . this field contains the name of the photographer . examples such as : employee photographer , Free photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a memor@@ andum of authority , this field has to be filled out .
publisher ( Syn@@ onym for providers ) : do not use the bid@@ der field to identify the photo . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer wants to be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the picture will find the image here , then the picture is indicated here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against mis@@ use . anyone who have a little more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator may delete or change it . the solution for this problem is only of low interest . for professionals and neck professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is uni@@ qu@@ ely unique . &amp; digi@@ plug comes in the near future , a module for st@@ acking processing is available in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs of those who lost on the road or a fire . those kind of losses are the same that you can also pass on traditional paper shots or neg@@ atives . in this section it is possible to solve problems in the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics that has a loss of data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs and you may not need them live longer than a few years . of course you can get more CDs and DVDs in archive quality . of course you can claim your life of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe that , in your exploration hall .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you are good discs and good recording devices . the best DVD slip devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you are much more reliable . it &apos;s therefore to choose the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able to errors even if you have just written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection it is by chemical anti@@ aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so B@@ uster &apos;s apparent wonders of CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but there &apos;s similar applications the damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppy disks , hard disks , Flash@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything is said to be used for Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn the data to high quality media at a non @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . do not hesitate to copy the data to the next generation of media . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before editing the latest hardware / software .
dis@@ solution manufacturers keep your statistics for itself . your manufacturers guarantee include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on error mechan@@ ion of hard drives : dis@@ mis@@ chief
soon : discount on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature applications , the most likely cause of error occurred . some of SM@@ ART can be reported due to the im@@ pending failure . these are in particular reading and publishing meter . the expected lifetime of life ranges between 4 and 5 years .
this is only a complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also create data loss due to a current if you have secured the files , but these losses can usually produce problems without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of power , that can take heavy damage when devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause these anom@@ al@@ ies , complete data loss , hardware @-@ aging , devast@@ ated mother@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves before the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against power peaks is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that part of the energy @-@ saving heat is absorbed and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a socket bar . but remember that not any connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that he protects the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also consider that it protects your protection against flash and thereby protects the correctly connected equipment .
as an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used on your computer , you should also consider that all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cables that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable entry and the TV map .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially developed for not@@ eb@@ ooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . so it is ideal for traveling .
during an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a fall of a few seconds can result to the loss of ir@@ relevant data . it can therefore be meaning@@ fully in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically shut down battery energy when power failure . this gives you the possibility to save your data , and you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security with electricity trouble with the costs to avoid these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about doing so . at the end you should remember all cables and drive back to the holiday .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Sh@@ ared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantities of your data .
they are in comparison to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data about compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images . it is not a poor solution , but there is no general securing solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services to have photos in full resolution . the professional variant offers you more available , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically . for $ 25 a year you will receive unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality .
from the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors will be automatically included thanks to the TCP protocol and are included in the offer of a backup and a partial storage .
the diagram illustr@@ ate the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all trans@@ missions are due to transmission errors . the file system will be added to the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred . all these problems remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection for this . no one seems to have thought that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought that the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss because they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . if normal file systems remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected especially of trans@@ missions , you should see in the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems will seem to be one of two candidates , which can handle on low level and is highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available soon . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched a dedicated initiative with its b@@ tr@@ m file system . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses the tender and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
these two factors are not responsible ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % at work bench systems . if not@@ eb@@ ooks , the share of th@@ iev@@ es is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of the most . it is currently limited to a lower loss , e.g. theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there has been no longer been sigh@@ ted .
open source file systems are less vulner@@ able for data loss when propri@@ etary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the pro@@ liferation file systems . please find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of temporary interrup@@ tions during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file not completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest thre@@ ats for digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture adjustments of fundamental physical limits . is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and smo@@ ker characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far removed from this border .
today cameras are very deterior@@ ated in the direction of the 10 meg@@ apix@@ els . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end results are the ideal for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apix@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you &apos;re doing so other for data loss . 6 % of all computers are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you do something like the new installation of your operating system , replacing boards or a size change of hard drives .
supp@@ ose you take your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then , one day , a flash , you are lucky when the drive wasn &apos;t connected to the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . don &apos;t forget pilot accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the entire house .
therefore , disin@@ teg@@ ration is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for data loss despite securing the pan@@ ic . if you have a backup is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot of without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation @-@ proof : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete moment up to two tim@@ es@@ ents : the complete backup and the final differential limit .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can produce the original status in any time . this backup means a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception that is only ab@@ get@@ ed and not continued .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily setup onto your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only changed the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase safety over ss@@ h .
secure important pictures directly after you have saved on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach can be found enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come back for backup . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for each month and a moment of notice for each month . any further dil@@ ution should be done manually after which you have done a complete check .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , usage of the internet .
so valuable pictures can survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really interested in you because they are remin@@ ded of your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of your nature , you need to consider and evaluate everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to leave with caution . all 5 @-@ 8 years should consult you like the current system back@@ ward . however , less varieties are used in the past , so light is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available today for any time . if you have an old system it is important that you need to read your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . continue with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional print to change the system in its size . this means , in fact , enlarge .
let &apos;s go out that you have to have the scal@@ ability with the bearing and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and put it to a new plate :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record has been recognized from the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; Disk ; d@@ d if = / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; partial re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; LT ; size of the plate in MB@@ is ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ dency / dev / s@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary
open source standard have the big advantage of an open specification . even if a day no software is available , you can create these yourself . this task is easier by the year too much .
GIF is a propri@@ etary , patented format that comes slowly from the market . you should not use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard which should replace GIF . however , it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can use gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ fying data for improved color order , but not as many as TIFF , and we would like to recommend you to store your images .
TIFF was widely used as picture format . TIFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm . a problem is however that this format has been adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital neg@@ atives file format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ open format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer makes it now available , and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also sometimes .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe creates its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP is for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ ad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is allowed with enlargement &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ c ; the file information is stored in XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer an original size of your recording , mostly in the shell format . however , it can cause problems in the lin@@ king between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and as at the top time , it should be superior to use whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ ad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , supporting a large area of application areas and modelling , discussions and collab@@ orative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fied efforts to reach met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
impor@@ ting images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera channels , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a host@@ ile processing you can use external programs . if you come back with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut off by other programs .
protect the mach@@ ined images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . then export them in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code them in MPEG , use contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section adding a photos to an album , you can add a description as you can already click on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to impor@@ ting images to your album database .
to use your digital camera and digi@@ plug , use this using the computer , switching the camera switches to display mode and switch them . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you launch the camera interface , it tries to take a while with your camera . if the connection is made , a distance indication of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras are not available . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file support for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you can download the photos on your computer , you might possibly need the camera information on each entry . with the side bars and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of one single or its met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file features and the photo information displayed internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras not available all information .
the rider Met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remarks , GPS etc . these information are the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; fix@@ tures ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer , is the click on the button to download and then download all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; fix@@ tures ; . when downloading the photos were not deleted and we would be sure to delete the images into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the selected using standard selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then select Selected . button selection Selected long as long as you have chosen some photos .
if your camera supports this , a option is now available . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in front window . if you select this option , the new pictures will be downloaded from this option .
if you use the kno@@ bs all download or download selected , a dialog with which you can select the target album . the list of existing albums you can read in section My albums . choose the target album from the list and press OK .
after completing the target album , press OK , and digi@@ plug comes ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you downloaded the desired photos you can delete them from the camera , you can delete all at once you want to delete the button . if you want to delete all this , you must select this first and want to delete all selected folders .
note that there is no possibility to restore the photos which you will be deleted from the camera . you should not verify whether the photos are successfully deleted from the camera ; you should be sure to delete them from the camera , if you want to complete the camera counter , this is much faster than the camera counter , since it is considerably faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially meaning@@ ful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are often util@@ ized after the photos of the camera were loaded , so it can be useful , the date and time when the image has been made , in@@ corporate the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for file @-@ based corruption . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options during the transfer opens three further options to be carried out before the photos on the disk will be stored . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF file will be copied to the IP@@ TC file . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use a different file format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M . if you place the date &amp; time . for further custom@@ ization you should read the help of the command @-@ time .
if you use the camera file names , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case you prefer to use this option .
the new file name , digi@@ plug , digi@@ plug , is shown below the name , the camera is displayed in the preview of the camera . your settings for ren@@ aming process will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
the digi@@ plug has come ; can perform all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic turn during shut@@ down . not all the cameras are ready to perform this information . in the Section side@@ bar Met@@ ad@@ ata you can find further details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is normally switched on , and when your camera does not provide this information , the photo in the original orient@@ entation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the bottom area of the window .
if your camera offers information about the date , which photo was made available , you can use &amp; digi@@ plug . all pictures with the same date are loaded in the same sub @-@ album . not all the cameras are available in the same sub @-@ album . not all the cameras are available in the section side@@ bar Meta Data , which might be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case stores and digi@@ plug , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , use the button extension and select the window based lower level at the lower end of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is downloading here . select the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that you want to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , digi@@ plug &amp; digi@@ plug comes ; you can choose where the images are loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . click here the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Positi@@ oning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this is a position that is indicated in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude , which can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photo@@ graph@@ s , it can be interesting to connect an image with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses a plane to cart@@ ograph@@ ed an area by automatic intake of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten then , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug , that can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug . if you want to locate the location of the photos , it is easy to document the position data of a photos .
the question is how the GPS data are supported in the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 has many GPS data fields such as the direction , traction and card conferences . the question is actually more , such as the data in those fields , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical mapping ( manual ) and last@@ ly via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS device . but there are a few that are working with GPS receivers . either as map module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel , as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and from GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; lin@@ ux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre @-@ mentioned coordinates using e.g. m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google .
m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
digi@@ plug &amp; fix@@ tures ; tries to give you much control over his work processes . there are many settings to connect the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ plug ; setting up to these settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left .
select &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are putting the standard behaviour of &amp; fix@@ tures ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ ac@@ ity and copyright data . these data will automatically be selected in the respective IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is written when you can download from camera line . this data will also be written in the IP@@ TC field .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the professional recording of the photographer . this field should be as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a closer description to the author , this field must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author if it &apos;s been shown here for a news agency , such as Reuters or Associated Press . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency would be the image available here .
the IP@@ TC actions put the data into the respective IP@@ TC wheel . this met@@ ad@@ ata must be permanently stored in the image and are not only available in the database of &amp; fix@@ tures ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; fix@@ tures ; imported without lost .
image certificates as embedded application ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images included in images . caution : with pictures that already contain labelling , these are over@@ written by the digi@@ plug .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . according to the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug comes ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to fixed , which file types &amp; digi@@ plug has been tried ; remove any file extensions to this list and remove any file in one &amp; digi@@ plug ; Alb@@ um@@ folders , which does not have any of these extensions ; igno@@ red by &amp; digi@@ plug .
the default settings can be reset back by pressing the button on the right of each category .
the settings of the optic ner@@ ve &amp; digi@@ plug can be set on this page . however , some pictures have changed different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use for fast computers . if you have one , then you can get a better picture results .
by default , picture processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose this here . you can use the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ clock and exposed parts of a picture can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing this section can be switched on with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , the images are encoded with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
with the setting up PNG comp@@ ressing , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not decrease the image quality , since PNG need more time to extract and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 compression .
with the TIFF ( TIFF ) you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality because the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm does not work any loss .
with the set of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can los@@ s@@ less save . even if you have written the loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was not yet supported , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported yet , however , was in planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; fix@@ tures , the picture processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very quick to change the man@@ ipulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default time@@ out is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , you create this option with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the image with a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white is used to use the camera . otherwise , when set , the automatic paint balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white is not set down . default , it &apos;s a fixed d@@ balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that the image has been selected in four steps , more details will be igno@@ red for different cameras . this option will be igno@@ red for different cameras .
the standard is the top @-@ fit , so the parts of your images are burned , due to the in@@ ability of your camera , as penet@@ rating white in the settings . the adjustment colours produces some unusual findings , as they can re@@ construct the hair@@ pin in various ros@@ es . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the sin@@ c@@ ere .
this is possible because blue pixels in general can not be so fast enough as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the lack of green and red shares from the yet not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise , and can therefore be adjusted individually for any picture .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the default 1 . but this may also be taken later in the image options of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing can be made too small to keep the time for the demo version , you should be con@@ serv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particles that have many cameras and one matrix colour pixels . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ mers structure .
digi@@ plug &amp; fix@@ tures are used ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it was produced by D@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour@@ ing of your l@@ ent@@ ils , you can put the red and blue correction data here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you will be carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as these are to be given . there are also LC@@ MS and digi@@ plug ; information like the color information of a colour space in the other are so that the colors are as accurately as possible .
behaviour matters if a picture in the image processing is opened / color management module with raw files .
color profile folders S@@ occupy the folder where e.g. / us@@ r / share / color / user / user / user / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you came back all your profile and digi@@ plug ; this folder is examined during the start of the start .
settings of the ICC @-@ Profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to depos@@ e . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour administrative view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or arg@@ l . here , only your images are not managed by the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model you are fit . not all profiles are contained in the same type . currently , PHost are currently corrected d@@ cra@@ b Gamma not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the h@@ ton@@ mapping ourselves .
there are more options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors so very saturated . this could manually correct , instead of the blin@@ d@@ algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obviously what color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not for the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and profiles can fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style of the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that can be used by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; imag@@ ery and image processing can support ; many modules are written to work together with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose which you will use and these modules are loaded and loaded . these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond . also , you can see some of them in the context menu of the front .
spont@@ aneous commit for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands .
more information ( in English ) on K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found via ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ g@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the trans@@ itions , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom end of the screen during display .
the camera characteristics indicate a list of all supported cameras on the left side . if you want to use this camera , make sure that the camera is connected properly , switched on and in picture display mode . among them are the port settings . currently , the port settings are standard , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ wire cameras ( IEEE @-@ 1394 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active when you have selected a USB@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to enter the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / ps , specify when you insert your camera .
to connect your digital camera and digi@@ plug , you need to connect the camera to your computer , put it in display mode and switch in the display mode .
check out if you come and digi@@ plug , the camera will automatically det@@ ects the camera . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear on the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be shown in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can include all here .
with the option dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; fix@@ tures ; when del@@ eting an photos in an album . in the sections of del@@ etion of photos and del@@ etion of an album , you will find further details .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be shut down through &amp; screw@@ ed ; if you use the option to use changes in the right side@@ bar without any query . otherwise , you have to save the changes with button modifications .
you may also sign the screen of CD &amp; fix@@ tures ; starting with the starting point . this will accelerate the start @-@ up of &amp; fix@@ tures .
the adjustment Bei@@ m start according to new photos are forced to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug . if something out of the base folder was deleted , you ask whether it is to delete these from the database .
various paint schem@@ as can be used in &amp; fix@@ tures ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be set in Settings design from the tool bar . a preview of available designs will be displayed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; fix@@ tures ; you will find more information about this tutorial .
and digi@@ plug comes ; contains a fast picture processing with some base tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image processing can be taken with a click with the left mouse button to preview a picture or through the context menu of preview and selection of details / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; fix@@ tures ; so you are not part of your distribution . further information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules are available in the image processing .
status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for fast access to most frequently used functions .
the processing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , not the functions will be used to save the original photo or the button Save from the tool bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo , once you have saved the image .
so you should be a copy of your image before you change it . this allows you to save with file save .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image automatically by using the menu button to restore the image processing , then you lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last deposit .
nearly any promotion of the image processing can be made or recovered or recovered . the last action can be converted back or re@@ produced by processing and restore editing from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the key short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to the reverse and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z for re@@ produce .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; through the return version or re @-@ produce button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the promotions are also restored in between also revers@@ ed .
once you started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation cards in the tool@@ bar , image high , image below or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can find in the photo and out , in which you will find C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fication factor automatic
view Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode . usually , you will use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can &apos;t change this tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can call it out of the digi@@ plug @-@ panel dialog . see this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the menu image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can adjust the settings here before using your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or entire phr@@ ases . all image preview can be selected from your choice . you must select only the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Expor@@ ting pressure assistance . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug comes ; main window has a side strip on the right edge , which is important to provide important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is , also available in the image processing , even if one of the five riders is clicked on :
multiple clicking on the same rider allows the side bar to disappear or disappear in the edge .
in the labelling view , you can specify labelling with unlimited size or insert . note the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . meaning that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ s fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC market in other applications , please note these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the button user or change to the next image , the labelling will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , this will always be done when you select a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written in the images .
the section assessment is showing an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ ting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to rate multiple images at the same time , choose these from and use the context menu .
the rating will be written into the IP@@ TC field . coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word shows a search box for the words of the key@@ words , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ plug .
the key@@ word is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief to the input of sample in a picture series . if you have entered different words , these are stored for fast access .
key@@ words can also be placed by selecting the appropriate fields in the tree . all the keywords of a picture are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if several pictures selected in the prime view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , If you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter .
the side bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , fil@@ ming , key@@ word and search views . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filters will be used from the right hand , only the cut quantity of this two are available . all created key@@ words are available .
you can also drag and off . supp@@ ose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word is already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and create a dialog box , which you asks whether you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example shows the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter stands on no key@@ words . the key@@ word is selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after it was filed a key@@ word from the right key@@ word to the selection and put it there . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be placed .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off using Settings .
if you have a rule with and realized that it must have or be it , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that will be found in the database . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , picture , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a character string that is already placed in the database .
for example , you can define an Extended search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group@@ ed options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then select the button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this product / tutorial has been written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly at &amp; digi@@ plug ; s specific implementation .
the reason why a colour @-@ administered workflow is that the colours created by your camera or scanners , you can achieve that colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners are able to print or publish the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners that are using your digital dark@@ rooms .
if the theme comes on color management , then everyone wants to press the results which he would like to press . unfortunately this tutorial tells you to provide sufficient background information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informative decisions make you the desired result .
if your image work@@ flows shall be met every six below , then you don &apos;t need to worry about color management .
they are calibr@@ ated at a monitor that calibr@@ ated the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found at the bottom )
its only other picture spending is by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ fac@@ to standard is standard .
so if the RGB works well and makes life for all so easy , why should you use another color space and do so thoughts on colour dig@@ s to do ?
a visual example of lim@@ iting from s@@ RGB compared to the colours that we really see can be seen below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representative of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ine region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 dimensional representative duties of s@@ RGB using some larger colour spher@@ es , you can also visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms last page and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I get my monitor , if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB @-@ color space or not , you don &apos;t need your monitor to s@@ RGB at your RGB . if you are using the color space of s@@ RGB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , using a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions to improve the image in most cases . use it therefore before you try further manual handling .
the functions standardi@@ zation , derived , Automatic , and contrast , extend automatic correction from the menu , try automatically trying to make the best . they will try to experiment with these effects , to see which works best on your photo .
norm@@ alize this method : this method is sc@@ aled across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
in the same method , this method adjust@@ s the lumin@@ osity of the colors of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram &apos;s hist@@ ogram function is as flat as possible . it is also only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle during a picture or it destroyed .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . determine the dark and bright tr@@ ages and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram area .
contrast Full : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of RGB values of a picture through the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest levels of all values in between . this is only visible at balanced pictures and may be a good correction for poor photos .
the white print of &amp; digi@@ plug comes ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of one photo .
the White Stor@@ z Cor@@ rection is something limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do so far from the original image , if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , then your ways are needed to correction better .
this tool is based on a white rec@@ al@@ ab@@ algorithm of copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ rome . they rest@@ art it with the menu entry colours white , equal to the image processing .
the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left side are the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically modified the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original wh@@ it@@ ish , then click on the window .
the preview of the target photos features a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els on this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top , a hist@@ ogram is displayed very useful as soon as you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , saturation and gamma . the shadow can be adjusted to your photos or download even down .
reflec@@ ting with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use the colour temperature to be used for the calculation of color temperature . this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed sub@@ division increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pix@@ els are over@@ exposed . you will be shown the combined result in white balance . this will be shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and load it exactly . any adjustment of the white load you can set this in a text file and load later again .
the default settings sets all filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white fl@@ ashes back . note that neutral settings will be shown in other photo as your original . if you want to save it , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the mach@@ ined image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this encoding is also required for high quality images . this encoding is also only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw pictures . it uses the change and instruction of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the hel@@ mets . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter colour administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under the audio correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always do the same mist@@ akes and you are always the same correction . in manual to the audio correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful option of exposure to correct is the tool to gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool color effects provides you four color @-@ effects , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a Neon Effect and an edge filter available .
in times of the chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image developed by the extra light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas of dar@@ ker and colours have been inver@@ ted . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of this picture . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is made reve@@ aling a negative image that &apos;s not to create photo paper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and adap@@ ting the ( 2 ) . applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid Filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and bright . try it simply , he emb@@ ell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for daylight converted colour film created by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly offers saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , the characteristics are also some photo graph@@ s , especially those who are barely landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edge . the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures , the filter can re@@ lie@@ ve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color @-@ color @-@ effects of your photos with the tools in menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , you can use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the converted problem . even in this case , the tool for brightness / saturation decreases a good choice to increase the saturation . all the changes can be seen in the preview . if Him do the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple cand@@ y strength / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you will need the range of the slide for here . specifically the three shi@@ fts below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains an Grap@@ h of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active can@@ als or the selected area . under the Grap@@ h are three shi@@ fts into the inside and to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright zones .
the easiest way to study operation is to post@@ p@@ one the knob and to make sure the picture changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically modified , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y @-@ axis . in pictures , the large areas of a consistent color does not contain the linear distor@@ tions of a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three knob : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones , and the lower tones for the middle tones , often gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color@@ im@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image used to adjust the input values of the shade , middle and light tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each range . there are also two controls can be used in order to evaluate the output values like the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create an un@@ spot@@ ted picture as a background while something different can be seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : this button will automatically set the image values depending on the intensity of the image .
save and load : using these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and later re@@ loaded . to this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all sh@@ adows , means and sun sounds . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click the preview of the original images for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
this option controlled by over@@ exposed pixels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of input values used on red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated in dependence on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this K@@ äst@@ chen , there are two symbols between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images with a consistent color , the linear mode has a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a shor@@ tw@@ ist to the right , i.e. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones of dark sayings are correspon@@ dent and the corresponding image pixels dar@@ ker become dar@@ ker .
in preview of the original photos , a red mark can be seen . if you want this marking on the area you want to change the original score . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and load : using these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve creates you can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Kur@@ ven@@ format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun sound . activate the d@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
this option considers all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun sounds was applied with the color p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel Mixer of &amp; fix@@ tures ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color sh@@ aded photos .
the Channel Mixer is another highly advanced tool to mix the colors of the pictures . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ ers of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can choose the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by adjusting the relative distribution and scales . the left pane of the window shows you a preview of The original can be viewed on your own rider .
the preview of the target picture has a red constra@@ int . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram window appears to show you the corresponding colour value .
the controls for the module are on the right below : knob for red , green and construction allows you to add these channels . if you use L@@ umin@@ ance , this is especially convenient when you can use the color mixer into the generation of amazing black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that occurs from colour@@ ing . although that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you can reduce the colour@@ ing first .
the save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer adjustment can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
this option controlled by over@@ exposed pixels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re@@ adjusted . option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the painted image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascin@@ ated because of your ab@@ str@@ action capacity . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . it looks good , among all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits toward the sky . i.e. similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves the landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . similarly , like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange filter .
rot@@ filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic over@@ ty effects and can simul@@ ate a lun@@ ar processes for day time . similarly , like the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ ate filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow liner filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the sho@@ cks . this is very similar to the process of fl@@ etching and recovery in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and so similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
wearing the &amp; digi@@ plug , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your picture , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for this .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the certificate of depth or three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ tu@@ re@@ ff is applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the change below ( 2 ) . the relief model relief is set at 200 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug comes ; the frame can be added , a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer &apos;s eye to the limits of a photos is no easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to be a decorative barrier . this is a psychological barrier to the scat@@ tering eye . under image frame , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you want to adjust the desired frame type for your image . immediately embr@@ ace the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button@@ hole and decor@@ atively add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : the width of the frame in percent . the value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture is larger than the original , but the original size is larger than the original but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have using the tool according to aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can add simple and format@@ ted text in a picture at any point . this also goes on several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply specify the text and place it with your mouse . use text size , orientation , color from the color space and the character set . at the end you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ clear background . the picture is finished .
any attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK . once the image has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it can &apos;t be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug , tool sten@@ cil template , you can put a template on a picture .
the menu image template in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you must add the PNG file format and should add to the maximum compression size . if you want to add your template &apos;s file size , then send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool to the first time , you need to set your Templates folder with the button folder in the dialog . choose the folder in which you have copied templates . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder for the templates was placed , a building man@@ tle appears to reflect the folder of a template &apos;s template . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can modify the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
Enlarge : this knob increases the under@@ lying picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button resi@@ zed the lower image . if you want to apply the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the entire picture , you have to reduced the picture to the picture below .
move : use this button to move the button under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adapted to the preview size .
digi@@ plug , three different tools are available . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very quick and easy , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture . actually it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to get an atmospheric dun@@ st , and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , because it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus and most digit@@ alized images need a correction of shar@@ p@@ ness . these results in fact that sharp edges are made up to a common colour . the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras does normally need more shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for the privacy .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has been applied internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the shell format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanner apply a shadow filter already during the reading of the image . if you dis@@ able this , you will get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen a photo with the Sch@@ är@@ fen &apos;s bul@@ lets . you can correct with the menu entry .
however , you should not work with this , since the results will not work very natural : the shar@@ p@@ ness increases the shar@@ p@@ ness of edges , but reinforced even the noise . in general , you can achieve further information about the menu entry . you will find further information and compare all techniques to shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to make a bit soft , it is much easier than it to shar@@ pen@@ ed . use the tool for turn@@ out with the menu entry and try something with settings . the front window on the right side of the dialog displays you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help the image to edit . the preview window displays the output of the film with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should try to be tried at first . if you increase the shar@@ p@@ ness or increase the effect . if you produce the shar@@ p@@ ness , smoke and get the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . they should therefore get images of the best in its final resolution .
the amount is the percentage between the original and the twi@@ sted image that is added to the original . thereby the strength of shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a breach of the maximum RGB value and to the differential pressure amount . it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft change is exemp@@ ted between the tones of the clay , and therefore beauti@@ full error in faces , sky and surface areas are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ bl@@ ur@@ red filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the revised picture the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked is applied with a radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 .
the fast@@ eners &amp; fix@@ tures ; Tool Re@@ focus focused on an image through improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to protect the protected di@@ versi@@ fication filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to get a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on how to try to shar@@ pen the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters . usually , the traditional technique to shar@@ pen@@ ance of pictures is the use of a shar@@ p@@ ness mask . you can start it out of the menu by pressing colors Re@@ fo@@ als in the image processing .
in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ge &apos;s F@@ ee . the Gau@@ ge &apos;s F@@ ee has a very long tail , which results in a very long tail , which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . the F@@ IR enn@@ ese Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of Gau@@ ß is affected even very strongly in most cases , causing un@@ wanted results .
circular edge shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results , if your image should be very un@@ sharp , but then you should pay a bit .
correlation : an increase of correlation can help to reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation was reduced to the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
room filters : an increase in the room filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0,1 only . if the noise is too low , eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is still sm@@ earing the image even further .
Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying ar@@ te@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can create good results , especially if you select large values for the circular shar@@ p@@ ness or the Gau@@ ge &apos;s shar@@ p@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters will be stored for later and then be loaded .
try all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture . the reason for this is that much sur@@ g@@ eries changes that are not visible immediately , but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images and remove , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , it produces in@@ sharp m@@ asked and better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by this , the un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ bar uses a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically it has to be bl@@ ur@@ red . even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters you can show the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the impossible mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small , focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about methods to refer to methods in digital images , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob has the edge of the c@@ ros@@ ci@@ ary to create a more natural pup@@ il in order to create an intact pup@@ il .
the colour tin@@ ent enables the customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the error correction is one of the most advanced tool , to remove no desired ar@@ te@@ - with unprecedented speed .
the entry algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ ferences as points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are shown below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the Reiter smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed explanation : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth gl@@ ass@@ ment on the image . a value of 0.9 should be found so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is necessary . please note the detailed explanation of the direc@@ tivity level should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ ed evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you create a movie gra@@ vit@@ ality or CCD im@@ pulse becomes a high value of w@@ ishing samples . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor on all@@ es. p then the relative smoo@@ thing . set this value as regards to the degree of smoking in your image .
rule tional@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value is needed , the more will be smoo@@ ther , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it has to be set higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm will pass through . usually this is 1 or 2 .
angular range da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is being voted , then make sure that small angle should create a long term . so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the More to quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . but it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to allow him .
buttons Save as and load do exactly this . any setting of image error can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image error correction is compar@@ atively very fast in work . but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load after getting off . you can therefore break the calculation at any time using button demol@@ ition .
below , you can see how to remove image error with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a picture that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see there is a strange black ar@@ te@@ f@@ akt in the fore@@ ground that caused by a poor film location during the trip , The original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , the noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image data . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides selected image filters to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sens@@ es from camera or modem . effects of saved pictures from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor cam@@ s of digital cameras , you can read this tutorial in this tutorial .
the screen photo above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , of 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can be the image taken over the picture and the colour in it will be sm@@ ooth@@ ed and therefore smaller flaws were adjusted .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the pixel pitch , which looks forward to adjust the filter distance . if it is increased , you can change the edges -@@ filter if you can change this setting . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image data can no longer receive and smoking .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for shar@@ p@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response of the filter can be removed . if it is too strong , you can remove the whole noise or cat@@ ching peaks . if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without any details .
light intensity : controls the lumin@@ ance lens of the image . we recommend either colour or light density to improve a picture . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ thing process by the details settings .
gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas which are typically stronger , but also cont@@ am@@ inated the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing damp@@ ing . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of light density . if it is increased , the edges appear to occur . if it is on its minimum , rob@@ bed and ph@@ ins can remove any noise and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters on the noise reduction which you have set , can be saved in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the fixed output was used with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to make the picture a bit soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to correct . use the tool for turn@@ out with the menu entry and try to experiment with the box . the presentation of this operation shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug comes ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo @-@ file data .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desirable arti@@ facts , film screen@@ ings , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized pictures . the smoo@@ thing is done along the image con@@ tours and gives the content as it is the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text reasons . the algorithm to Rest@@ oration is carried out with a different tool , the error correction was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ ks and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ cho@@ ic@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards which are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
buttons Save as well as loading are exactly this . any setup of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast in the work . however , it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load after getting off . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with button Finish button .
below , you can reduce like a photo with equal mode . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a Sens@@ iti@@ vity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the not@@ ori@@ ous film screen@@ ings on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct counter ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , Tex@@ tures was reduced to an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ as from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ ical and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the fast@@ eners &amp; fix@@ ings ; Tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixels of photos which have been removed with a CCD camera , eight uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are especially important for high quality raw mode photos , because many cameras with JPEG compression has a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; at a photo using a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the assist@@ ants with a button dark image . the tool will recogn@@ ise automatic and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the preview window .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can record the dark image directly in the port to discover new name or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to correct image . a automatic processing of dark image will be found . note here that the assist@@ ent re@@ members the last dark image and will automatically re@@ load this automatically at the next session .
the picture range and the preview can help you correct the result . the preview window displays the output of the film with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview ranges .
select an area to see the broken pixels at the preview and results of the film . choose the best Filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it is determined by an average of the islands . the resulting colour is assigned to all def@@ ectives in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all the pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel pitch will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ tering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel screen is moved to a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are withdrawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a def@@ ective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long layer of exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the revised picture is below ( 2 ) .
digi@@ plug &amp; fix@@ tures ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under exposed corners , a picture to correct .
wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reach the edges and reduce the sensor . tel@@ e objective display may also show this behaviour .
but also has draw@@ backs . many center filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be possible , even with Center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen effects are caused by movement .
with the wide exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and color scanner and film @-@ Scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ aser using a raw image that is made without these filters . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is applied to an image that is protected by John Walker . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regulations , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and control the im@@ aging of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of luminous intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , or random an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or random to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree of rotation .
leu@@ k@@ ills , contrast and gamma @-@ settings : the processing of a image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is reduced by the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . regul@@ ators make you only positive values when you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a host@@ ile rec@@ ir@@ ation of the target image , then let the values for light intensity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug . image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a pioneer of cand@@ y and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug comes ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distortion . coloured distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second order covers the general geomet@@ ric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third gra@@ b has a similar effect set , fl@@ atten@@ ed in the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient in the fourth floor correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second gradient . if you combine this two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distortion &apos;s second gradient . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values between distortion types .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value looks stronger than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ ent@@ ils , the &apos; Corner parameter is the reverse parameter of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and therefore results in a correction first gra@@ des . negative values enlarge the positive image .
brigh@@ tly : this value is adjusted in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values will increase it .
in order to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows a preview of the distor@@ tions . the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values .
the tonn@@ age or coh@@ ort @-@ corrected correction should be carried out before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . if you need to cut this correction and then perform a picture @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the folding .
in order to help you make the best correction to help you display this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea level or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot . in the connection you can correct the tonn@@ age / k@@ is@@ sen@@ ic distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cold @-@ like distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the mapping tool in menu transform@@ ations from the image processing or via the knob of this dialog .
for most images , you need to correction data @-@ like correction . the next logical step for some designs , e.g. photos from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of using tons @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ate infr@@ a film on the G@@ enn@@ ett @-@ Gur@@ abo website which is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a Sens@@ iti@@ v@@ tivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
on the left side of the window you can choose the area for the preview . if you move the red square with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters for film screen@@ ings and film sensitivity . the ISO regulator has changed the volume of gra@@ zing a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gra@@ ins and the predomin@@ ance of colour Green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter channels are used to produce an infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos because the colour information would be missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a filter paper used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the revised picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter film screen@@ ings is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ produce film screen@@ shots like the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known for the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturer large silver gra@@ ins of the photo o@@ emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ b effect gives your photo a certain m@@ oods or appears to move back to the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight , you need to use this filter .
regulator can be calibr@@ ated the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the body . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ dation effect based on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two knob to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the pin size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side , the hing@@ ed .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the frame is marked with the ( 2 ) image size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter drawing has used colour and intensity gra@@ dients in order to create a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . the lines whose gra@@ ins are slowly changed are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you would have chosen you would have chosen to catch you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( gl@@ ass@@ y ) .
this is an example of the carbon label filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved further through adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving the image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped on wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug comes ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color does not use the most important at content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration . a value of 30 corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engra@@ v@@ ings filter . the original ( 1 ) and the revised picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by distortion effects . it uses protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and look it like if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can stop this effects at any time with button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of visual acuity . it uses protected algorith@@ ms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom lenses : twi@@ sted the picture along stone @-@ shaped lines the way out from a center . this simul@@ ates a zo@@ om@@ ent camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radial red@@ ness : twi@@ sted the picture by turning the pixel to a center . this simul@@ ates the infin@@ ness of a turned camera .
distances : p@@ onder@@ ing the image to create an un@@ focused camera lens . the object seems to re@@ sign back in the background .
movement of motion : p@@ onder@@ ing the image through horizontal movements of pixel . this simul@@ ates the p@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographic , camera .
soft@@ shell : p@@ onder@@ ing the picture soft in the dark and strong in the light tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or to add a warm and sub@@ til@@ ed bulb .
shar@@ pen@@ sive shar@@ p@@ ness : distor@@ ted the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ sever@@ ity of a arbitr@@ ary camera .
intelligent im@@ pot@@ ent : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and cut them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divided the picture in rectangular cells and then created the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with button Finish button .
the regul@@ ators are a nice little tool to make rain rop@@ es on your image . this makes it all of your paintings a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
the size of the image size allows to change the size of the image . since the drop@@ ping size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image . the quantity changes the number and density of drops . fish modified the optical effect of the drop to the image .
you can start with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; picture processing has a range of free of regul@@ ators . use the option to select the range , e.g. a face that will stay free to stay free . if you start the filter , the range will remain free of reg@@ ap@@ ing .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning to the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform@@ ations Tur@@ ning or Transform@@ ers .
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ inking is simple . the big question is how you can get a picture sequence and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm is used here , making it a good work here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
when a photo of the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog box below is visible .
the tool size is used to change a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split scop@@ es . uses a further developed approach . the based algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the GR@@ EC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and see below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this option is enabled , the aspect ratio of the new size will be retained .
rule tional@@ ity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value is needed , the more will be smoo@@ ther , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect .
buttons Save as and load are used exactly . any st@@ aging for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take much long and take a high CPU load after getting off . you can break the calculation at any time with button Finish button .
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles having been enlarged by a small color picture onto the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the result ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photos is not only a frequently used operation , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to put a picture . the mouse simply need to cut a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse .
when you let down the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . thus you will get a good overview of your picture after cutting . you can create the size of the cut space by moving to the corners of the rectangle . create a new square by clicking on the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tail@@ ored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or file Save as in the menu file to save the newly created photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be retained .
in the tool you can also specify the orientation as high format or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ size of the width is assigned .
the tool After side @-@ ratios use a foam aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you prefer to use In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizontal or vertically .
below in the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation , setting .
the tool After switching aspect allows its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ al ) . if you are using the mapping tool , these settings are displayed as standard values in the EX@@ IF file , so the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the image &apos;s image and not the original image .
the help of the compositions that help you to assemble your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of the simil@@ arity . such as the third @-@ thirds , harmon@@ ic triangles have an opportunity to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that covers different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Naut@@ ilus shell or the leaf sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things we can feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the error number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you already used to build your temple and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden propor@@ tions in all times when you create your images , buildings and even pictures to put your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number is directed by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where any number after 1 is the sum of their two preceding numbers . the resulting partition is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . an composition which is this rule is considered vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center pos@@ es liquid aid lines if you are an image . these help numbers are drawn down below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you to your target good results for your photos . compared to third party , the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the image . this type of composition measures the sight of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule are the right corner of the golden spiral , also called golden sp@@ ell . this right corner can be used to direct the golden spiral . this can be a line of its or different objects . this one can simply be just as being without the eye , it will accompl@@ ish its task .
the golden triangles are also discussed by the above golden spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the golden right corner . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , gold triangles have no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to this lines can be issued a static object of dynamic .
when you use golden triangles to qu@@ icken your frame and create a effect of professional photo photograph@@ ers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach differently .
the options horizont@@ ally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ious divi@@ ders .
with the button color you can set the colour of the relief lines . if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be in@@ visi@@ bly . in this way you can adjust the colour of the lines to your current picture .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture taken in which the things are shot at an angle . you can use it with the &amp; digi@@ plug . choose transformation of free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . using button Pre@@ ferences you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right @-@ hand side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
for your help , the module has a horizontal and a vertical line available . after moving the mouse over the two lines , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle like in previous section .
after you have shot a picture , you will find an un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function of cutting of cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing sm@@ ooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . note , however , please note the above warning .
all Per@@ spectives transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point of the reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you must use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog you will find some information which you will help to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas which were created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty fields created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : displays the actual angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : displays the actual angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture will cont@@ am@@ inate a little bit . for single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce twice as strong effect and you should avoid these if possible .
after taking the perspective , you get un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes on the corners . an opportunity to hide this is the image with transform@@ able cutting from the frame processing .
the tool tool is used to move a portion of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite side . this is no rotation , the image will be distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about trans@@ missions sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ure your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners . if you push the horizontal angle and vertical at the same time . if you want to set the angle to zero . a preview of the target will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right .
to help you get a vertical and a horizontal line built . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines . you can now adjust the tool button to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the shot , the picture will be slightly negli@@ gible . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ lec@@ ting , but two ch@@ ings are produced twice as much , so you should avoid this .
after the closure , the picture has the picture of un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate this is the image with Transform@@ ers cutting out of the frame processing .
digi@@ plug comes ; needs a number of libraries and other pack@@ ets to read and write . those available in some cases , from the type of libraries are comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will have a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
because of other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site . but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
digi@@ plug @-@ made ; only files in formats used to the list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file in the list is listed below . you can change this list of file extensions , which can change . in the section configuration , you will find further information .
almost all digital cameras can store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose to use the format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug are supported ; supports both formats .
compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also be returned if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw file format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw formats images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw converter of &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
fast@@ eners &amp; standoffs digi@@ plug ; supports the load of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which comes in &amp; digi@@ plug . all support cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . table below shows a short list of raw formats used by &amp; fix@@ tures ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in the avi@@ or or MPEG format ; but it does not understand these formats and has no film editing feature . if you click on a movie file , you don &apos;t use the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start playing the program .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chron@@ icles . you can only go back when you go back in advance .

all configurable cameras are listed here . you can use the entry camera from the menu to add a new camera to the list . please check in the camera according to further information .
K@@ IP@@ I module exports a series of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth .
if you de@@ fer the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment using the white module .
many tools you need the photo processing are included in &amp; fix@@ tures ; included . their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ marks , pressing , pressing , un@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture used ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter to the current image . the links of him allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of view . these modes are :
vertically split without duplic@@ ates . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area of the selected area .
horizont@@ ally divided without duplic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area of the selected area .
vertical parts . the left pane shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
share horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the lower than the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to over@@ - and exposure to over@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose a preview . you can pick up this frame with the mouse within the picture and click on the part of the picture from which you want to see . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons onto your default values . all obj@@ ectors of the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar characteristics shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ expl@@ oring . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : shows a summary of the key parameters when shooting the photos . these data are taken from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider is an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ bus . you can move it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move up a square . all pictures inside these coordinates will be filtered and displayed . this is of course the your pictures are recorded by G@@ eo @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is a editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used for processing color pall@@ ets and to choose and use colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog window you can select from a list of the installed pall@@ ets or search the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to the colour . colour is described under the pallet view . here also the colour name can be changed .
it can also be used to choose a choice , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with a pressing left mouse button .
if the check box you can add cur@@ sor into the cur@@ sor position , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor position . the color is inserted either inserted or translate any other ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ written , you can adjust the check box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and insertion .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color , three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , if a further colour is followed . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
colors in the palette and output of colour selection can be pulled down with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then click on the left on the left .
&amp; litho@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphical ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Grap@@ h . graph@@ s are used in computer science , especially in computer science , especially in computer science , especially in computer science . so far , there are no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the &amp; k@@ not@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; litho@@ graph@@ s ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphical ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . &amp; graph@@ s ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well built &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a modification of Grap@@ h in &amp; Kate ; calcul@@ ating the Grap@@ h in &amp; cran@@ ial ; )
menu to open the Grap@@ h in &amp; Kate ; open or graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; in a &amp; Kate ; item to open
load large Grap@@ h ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ not@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graphical ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of graph@@ s . you are needed in detail :
the main window shows the open Grap@@ h , each in a own sub@@ window . initially , if you can start &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; without any argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar will only open the icon and the ( empty ) List of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog box .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files you will see the main windows like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview of the corner is displayed if Grap@@ h is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this product with the context menu .
use the mouse wheel ( high and round without special keys , left and right at ge@@ op@@ t &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of Grap@@ h .
if the file changed in &amp; k@@ graphical ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . can also note your decision later , so you can change your decision later , you can setup the menu settings . do not see , see also .
if you open a graph outside of a running &amp; k@@ is@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ is@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the Grap@@ h Grap@@ h in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change with the setup dialog .
when the program start , you can open all Grap@@ h of your last session . again , you can save your choice either as well as later .
they can also define how the graph is to be split into several sides . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of Grap@@ h , which are placed on this page , will be igno@@ red on this page . if you fill the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of Grap@@ h .
page preview with one on several sides , graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again loading the possibility to specify the behaviour if a file on the hard disk was modified , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes every time ) .
the site can open the possibility to define the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ s ; if a graph is opened outside of a current session . open the Grap@@ h in a new window or determine in a window of the current session or determine that every time is asked .
the site sitting administration gives the possibility to define the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ not@@ ices . you can open a standard behaviour ( or not ) or determine if any start is required .
the context menu , which normally appear in a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose from various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorith@@ ms select . entries as they are described on &amp; graphical web@@ page ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the default for directional graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or signed represent@@ ations of the bit@@ es . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom , left to right ) and try to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ onal over@@ laps .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ od@@ ly graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the target spring mod@@ ells . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ riv@@ eting graph@@ s a j@@ umping spring model layout . it uses the fru@@ gal @-@ clean gold @-@ characteristic , and includes a free sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clust@@ ered graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; Algorith@@ m as@@ signs the no@@ des of circular , in accordance to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of several cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
a dialog box opens up a dialog where you can specify a layout command as parameter , and specify the calculated layout of Grap@@ h after st@@ out in x@@ dot @-@ format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; edit specific options , or use graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of Grap@@ h ( directed or ung@@ od@@ d ) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ used graph ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit . geographical data are stored in the image data stored in the EX@@ IF file and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo , to loc@@ alize altitude , longitudinal and lat@@ itude .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS trace as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ p@@ sb@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data to your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to upload a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course data that were added to the same location as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded by a automatic correlation , the coordinates must be recorded in red . GPS trace data are recorded at GMT time and therefore must be carried out with the GMT time . this can be done with the time zone . set up your camera zone here .
setting the maximum deviation for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera conditions . the difference between them are merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a track data from a place for images you can edit the GP@@ X file and add the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog box is using a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to set the data with the current photo .
the loc@@ alization can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it . in addition , choose the relevant region and enlarge it . the height can always be selected manually , until you have to be selected manually , the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are options to hang up the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to add a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery of HTML pages . you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best international@@ ization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider can only select all albums . you need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side you can quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider of appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ expl@@ oring . if you click on a picture in each picture will be displayed a new page . otherwise the image will be shown directly with your standard photo viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ch@@ show , shown on the picture .
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be saved with all your corresponding images . choose a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored in the new images .
with other colour depth , you can change the standard color depth , of course also the file size . all other settings are explained clearly .
the rider color pictures allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the template , that are small pictures displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user to how far the action is . press ab@@ rupt to break the process .
when the module produces the sides , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program titles automatically at the end of the web browser . the web browser is automatically started to display the preview of the gallery . press the module to connect the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image viewer allows it to look at a selection of images and to them base operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or move . the viewer can be used with short @-@ be@@ ats and fast access to its functions .
after launching , a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change pictures without sacrific@@ ing your quality .
this module allows you to save images listed below , images in JPEG format , without any losses on quality or met@@ ad@@ ata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage , it is rising to the file size because no compression of the color information is taking place . this can be found in the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is currently no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the ma@@ iling list k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I teams .
using the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy the data from a picture to another . then choose the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with any image formats . you can copy anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please see ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see what formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a series of images into a m@@ peg video in the form of a dip .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images in a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual pictures you can add a base image file . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of Di@@ ash@@ au .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can choose the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to install the images that are packed into the m@@ peg slide show . after that , you can start with extr@@ as MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au to start the module .
the pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sor@@ ting of images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should custom@@ ize the other settings . if you are planning the video format from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD , you must default the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture . the speed of the image pass is fixed among them . a lower value creates very sudden , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and the path of the created file can be specified under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension to the extension .
if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start converting all settings your needs , you can quickly go to the production of your computer . depending on your computer &apos;s speed you can go quickly and enjoy a coffee , if you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths among the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below .
the printer assistant allows several images to print on a sheet paper along with standard phot@@ ogram . this is also useful automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example : useful to improve you or using the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command station d@@ cra@@ b of Dave Coff@@ in . an original score by Dave isn &apos;t seen that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get there with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , first the RAW file will be converted and start the module . the R@@ aw @-@ Camera window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the converting process . the first option decides whether you are to use the camera settings like gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers . if the result is not optimally , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats , and the converting result is equal , and only the expansion is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged Image format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you have frequently used to edit your images or you later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select to JPEG image formats , the met@@ ad@@ ata are stored in the JPEG file are stored in JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the button . if you want to break this process , you can break it off .
the stackable mode allows you to convert various images to one time . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. through testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have here the possibility to over@@ write the file . this is helpful , however , this is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available on how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in a album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting point and the tim@@ est@@ amp to be used .
this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the image range from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can re@@ size the image or enlarge four types of images :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , this option might use to adjust your image format .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the photo for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of photo paper . the target picture , including background size , border size and background colour is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send chosen pictures with your preferred email program . there is also possible to change the size of the set images before . further pictures can extract and place there on the list of p@@ aw@@ ed pictures .
after having launched the module , the images will be displayed with the size of your chosen images . you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview on the right is displayed .
you can also drag images to the picture list and add there to the list of images too .
using the button Pictures , the selected images are removed from the list of images .
after you have selected all images , you can open the new message from your e @-@ mail client click here . you &apos;ll need to add the addresses and the subject . the selected images are added already as app@@ endix .
be careful not to send you too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of the coming e @-@ mails . it is possibly a good idea to send more emails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and changed every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field , including the right path for your installation .
in case you use the Google Mail service you need to install the GM@@ ail@@ agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file , the comments added to the images added into a text file together and added the mail .
the PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to any loss of files such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG , if you do not have any fast Internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG format and choose the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ 5 will be added to the real pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program is started automatically at the end . using button sk@@ irt you can make this window s@@ lie ? EN .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window with questions like you want to have shown your slide show . you can choose between the selected and select all the images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation makes use very elegant im@@ aging with Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file names will show that the record will be displayed in the bottom left corner during the presentation .
this option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then break it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures in the album .
under delay between the pictures , the time interval can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly cho@@ oses a different effect on each transition between the images .
during Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , stop the previous and stop the slide .
at the bottom of the screen , you can view the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current picture and the entire number of images displayed in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; Date is currently no documentation . if you are interested , please contact the ma@@ iling list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under k@@ de @-@ im@@ aging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the basement , as a background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can see with &amp; photo album ; by these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture , in each group , in people , places and in the group Key@@ words are present .
in the browser window you will see the categories you have provided information about your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to view the file structure on your hard disk , and of course the current template . in the following , each of them is described .
when you press the mouse on the associated entry you change the view of the browser . see picture .
if you select one more person only the images are displayed on which both of them are visible . by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the places , places and other settings , you can view images to view the pictures of your unit area .
in the picture , every person has the same symbol before their names . you can use &amp; photo album ; but for each person you can have own image image , this also applies to places , key@@ words and other categories you have defined . see the picture .
in order to display images in addition to the names , select the view that you want to use right outside on the tool bar . please note that you can view the view for every category . that &apos;s the advantage you can view symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t own appropriate images for your key@@ words ) .
however , you need to determine which image for each individual person is to be displayed . now you can select the image editor , as shown in the picture below . in the saf@@ est window , you can custom@@ ize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and therefore select which portion of the picture should be displayed and cut off .
when you find the entry in the main window , you will find a dialogue which is very similar to the dialog for the fixed image properties . this dialog can look at the image once again .
if you want to enter a character sequence in the field of label or description , the labelling must be searched or descriptions of the images after this text ; the date may either use a portion of the entire date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
using the Options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images as well as you can see in the picture . here it will be shown in pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manual books , but rather like to test functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; Photo Album ; and look forward the quick@@ est , screen photos and introductory videos .
run &amp; photo album ; and in the first dialog start the demo , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or choose from the menu to the menu entry @-@ album ; and then some sample images are loaded and you can test the features of &amp; photo album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as a related HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this bar shows you here : . as the name suggests , this surro@@ unds you record statistics about the images in your database .
the time bar can show you several different time units . each bar shows a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the l@@ ath just 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be used on the following ways : you can change the displayed message view from the database ( if you select a date , you will always see the first picture of this date displayed in the preview window ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images displayed if you navigate in the Preview view .
you can also select a range of the time bar by pressing the mouse over the ruler of the time bar , so the time values , you will show you in the preview view only pictures of this period . you can pick up the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar .
&amp; photo album ; presents you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as a module available in &amp; photo album ; built @-@ in version , which allows you to create over the HTML menu File ....
before using HTML pages , you have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . each area is described in detail .
first , enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later . click on photo album ; HTML @-@ Example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , you can choose whether you can see a &amp; photo album ; export file is to be seen on the viewing side . ferry information about export files will be found in .
recently , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is shown without the description . note that all pictures of a party are obvious . note that all pictures have been exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewing .
in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most insertion options are clear , which is why not specifically received .
below the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who have a resolution of 800x600 and have a monitor that have the maximum resolution 800x600 which have a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
you can change the resolution at any time you can change the resolution at any time . it can therefore search your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time , if it would like to display a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting range , place the various folders and the URL points where your website is stored .
at best , choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub @-@ folder .
first , you have to select the main folder where all your images will be stored . this folder will be saved and added to the next time . this file allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support file , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can verify that this really is all for viewing . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , the URL should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet able to copy them in the final target folder , see , correctly , you have to specify the final goal of the files , but this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the basic configuration options described above are all three on the basis folder or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ file is created , whose name you define in the output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; collab@@ orative pictures , you might want to add a HTML page to viewing the images . however , you may need to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures , recording site , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work will not even make it even more .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your images in a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other into your database . these can be imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ to whether the pictures itself is stored in the file or whether in the file it is only a lin@@ king to store that you can put all images into the file and allow them to give this file as independent . however , the obvious change is the file size .
you can choose a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file expor@@ ting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file sear@@ ches for the images that are stored in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , so the pictures of the URL you are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for expor@@ ting images , which allows you to export over the menu File menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether you should act internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there will be the following three choices options available :
when you copy Manu@@ ally to the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option , automatically copy the .@@ k@@ in file to the .@@ k@@ in file ; the pictures automatically supports you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . because most pictures have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is really small , it is usually not able to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , simply select the option export file .
the last option of this page is limit sizes . if you send your friends pictures , you want to limit the pictures maybe not in full size because the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . here you can say the size limit , for example , that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ting ... select &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to the impor@@ ting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder you want to import images .
it may be that you can be the category of people who is to be imported in the event . therefore , you are asked in the third dialog window to be imported into what categories of imported file should be imported into what categories are to be imported in your database .
in the fourth step you can copy the categories of the file with the categories of your current database . one example will see you on the picture .
it must be simple to browse pictures and look at : if you see pictures , you want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you like to see all the photos on which this friend is shown .
in this manual you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) to search for information about your images , through ( 2 ) to search and see up to ( 3 ) Advanced themes and adap@@ tion options .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for managing your images . but it was expanded and today it also takes your videos . at many places in this manual we have talked about pictures , but often , this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; stores all the information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where you want to back up .
&amp; photo album ; now re@@ members the folder where your images are saved and automatically used this at future Star@@ ts . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo album ; therefore , you can start &amp; photo album ; using the -@@ c option , as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry dialog for Settings ... you can proceed to a window that you can modify the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user book , you will be explained in the following section of the user .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can set the setup possibilities of preview and the options for viewing will be available . you can call a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it has been described in you how to define several properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
on check the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog box options you can set complete members of members , e.g. all members of a group instead of one group instead of all groups of a medium as in explains .
in view the adjustment options that are available to the fixed list of members . in the above list box you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window side you can choose a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo album ; share its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ p@@ am and g@@ ond@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . nearby information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called up via the menu modules . these modules can not be described as they are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can call for the modules itself .
since the modules are used together with other applications , it can be used to test the modules with &amp; photo album ; therefore , you should always call new modules at first with the command &gt; photo album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ .exe \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not have been war@@ ned !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I together , are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when you divide functions with different applications .
the largest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications could not support their images in albums . even if &amp; photo album ; this kind of order not supported , simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the features with &amp; photo album .
the photo album is simul@@ ated &amp; photo album ; the current album that is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview now displayed .
in addition to the current album &amp; photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the setup dialog as Category for virtual albums . for example , if you &apos;re using the category people , you will do &amp; photo album ; so do if you would have selected people to view this .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules that will be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you can start &amp; photo album ; start your own pictures .
as you are usual from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and a tool bar . under the tool bar , there are not much information about your images . in the section we will see on this window , now click on this window , now click on the images that shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ - album ; is the opportunity to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who have shown on the picture above . if you can see each picture individually or used for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if used on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all images were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and Brow@@ se when you can read in the section . if you like , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
in case you can set three lists with a text field by setting up people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; because you will always use them again , if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on the pictures within the list : if you are depicted a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be shown , so that the names are shifted upward , the persons can be moved fast and arrange them .
if you prefer to order a alphabetical list of ill@@ iter@@ ate list , click on the icon to sort by date below the list .
if you have selected remarks on each picture individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , click on the back and back buttons , which are below the preview of the picture at the top .
if you have several pictures , for example with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and select the menu item added to once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as a over@@ board . in order to indicate that it is a group , a special symbol is indicated .
in the context menu of the atten@@ tive di@@ alog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to a existing or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry simply to a category and place there in order to order to a sub@@ category of this single . attention , this is preferred to order your categories in alphabetical order .
you can move the individual elements of the slide show , by clicking the top view of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drag it out outside the window range .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs to be satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window .
you can even leave a frame fully off . if you want to retri@@ eve this window later , use the button Options ... and then window a / off . this process will see you in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter . for example , you can see the size of the image images , by simply to configure the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply .
if you want to view a picture on the back of your desktop , this image will be used as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this picture will be shown in the picture . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview menu . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete or choose either choose the button or select in the Edit menu . now , you will display the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo album ; the pictures also offers you a solution . you can also use &amp; photo album ; namely pictures even if you have saved on the hard disk . of course you need to record the pictures somewhere on your hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut off , are not on the hard disk . for example , in pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , these pictures are present , so you can view the preview of these pictures . you can &apos;t view this pictures even with the picture .
as you can see this feature you need to copy files from folders and again copying them . &amp; photo album ; if you want to avoid trouble you want to avoid any of the required CD , please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you wish to make a little more privacy , make sure that you may see for other un@@ access@@ able in the menu . alternatively , you can also see all the images that can see your little sister , and choose the menu item Every@@ thing except the current view .
so you have defined what pictures are hidden in the case of your little sister , simply select the menu entry to your little sister , so if you want to lock all the images you want to lock . if you want to display the images again , click Sper@@ m .
it is also possible to define a password which must be entered for un@@ lock the images . in order to set this password , simply select password change in menu privacy .
please consider that this picture protection is not very secure . for example , all images on the hard disk and other one can read or delete the password as an un@@ equal text or delete . this type of password protection is only used for those who are familiar with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to we@@ ave the view to private images .
the reason why you manage all your pictures featuring &amp; photo album ; you need to describe it and hours about hours this is of course you want to consider them . from this reason you will find &amp; photo album ; this is why you can preview it out of the preview , as described in .
you can see the viewer , of course you can see the picture , but additional information that you have set on the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can also configure which information displayed and if you are displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the context menu click can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on the browser , see , matching entries in this list . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and return , by using the keys image high and image below . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide @-@ album . then , a new image will be loaded after a few seconds . just like often a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus the button . started and stopped using the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s viewer &apos;s album ; it can be used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer is using the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you &apos;re using the viewer , you can simply draw back up with the mouse . with the min@@ us key , you can easily zoom down the Plus button in the middle of the picture . showing how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom so that the image will not be drawn . with the principle of the zoom , so that every pixel of pixels of the image is equivalent to the screen .
note that the single zoom @-@ operations that work in videos that come in , and zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ eria are .
you can turn the image from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can not use comments on the latest image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at the picture you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to sign up this name . however , you will perhaps select the image to mark and look more pictures .
a further situation is that you want to send a number of images onto a printer to see what photos you want to start with the images and mark them as good or bad mark , while you can view one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to draw pictures with features , while you can view it . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can see a feature that you press the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your pictures , you can see them in the browser . this is what you can always choose to print any images . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD , or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in DR@@ E preview view , then you can add characteristics to the images by choosing the letters for the feature , after the image has been selected . this can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you can see &amp; photo album ; painting on the picture .
the same will not be saved with the picture but in the database . on the way you can make your ground later .
in a picture you can see a picture on the painted screen . in order to switch the painting mode of &amp; photo album ; then select the image from the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to do the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not completely rule , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should definitely read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and display the object in wireless views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all the objects are selected already with the object .
to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and select either in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
there are more possible positions , the following work down menu will be built , so that you can choose the right position :
delete either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove the selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified Properties , click on the user to adopt these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message with an error description is displayed . then you can extract the input error and re@@ ject or re@@ ject the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter a user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download them here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a portion of a texture , you can view a preview of Featured Preview .
press preview in the corporate view and a small example of the scene will be selected using the selected texture . if you want to choose a sub@@ ordin@@ ate element , if you want to be a part of the texture rate ( for example , a texture in a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , then cross@@ wise locally .
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw up these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire @-@ model view . this cruci@@ fix marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift by pulling in the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visible laser level . you can specify this value relative to the Vis@@ i@@ bility level of the higher object or as absolute value . objects will only be shown if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar selected from the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as pre@@ set . the object tree and view of the object characteristics are shown to the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window rules or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as desired . you can also save multiple window devices and change between different orders .
to anchor a window over or under one side view , pull the facade to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle is then displaying the new position .
to create a new column , drag the link to the right or left side of a view . the new view will be an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this list and extends over the overall height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , take the address in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card cards back to the Vi@@ ews .
the last possible window rules are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the fixing to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left corner .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the direction bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the menu View you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can store you back with a window of window ... save a dialog where you can save the window rules when using existing or new names .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program was written correctly and P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the icon of ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry of the scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of audio modes , from a fast preview of up to full screen in highest quality .
if you click on the Symbol The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or select in the menu View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each rack @-@ mode has a name . you can only enter any name , it is useful but a name that lets you recognize the mode of mode .
in the map size you can choose the width and height of the rendered image . if you want only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image detail into the input field .
in the combination of quality you can choose the characteristics , select &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions illumination . an exhau@@ sti@@ ve description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the us@@ erh@@ and@@ buch on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , you can find various errors . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stepped effects in curves and lines , and sometimes they are not shown in representation smaller than one pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing in order to reduce the influence of this error . in general , pictures featuring this property is better .
when you turn off Anti @-@ ali@@ asing , it connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique means super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is rec@@ eded and adapted for rec@@ tional depth of the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray has transferred a ray per pixel . if the difference between colour values , then , both pixels will be adjusted with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated additional points , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional radi@@ als per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue in the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . when the difference between colour values then exceeds the specified threshold , the pixels will be tr@@ acked into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which can be pursued individually and set to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ycle can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to ali@@ asing the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of rob@@ bers for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid frequent patterns .
the latest setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use reflection refle@@ ctions will be calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this cardboard card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is un@@ finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file impor@@ ting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported and not complete the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when impor@@ ting error messages or warning messages , a dialog window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this is adding to the source text of the object in the editor . simply select the source text in the editor and drag it to the object .
with copying and insertion in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can also attach the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is created . it is usually this p@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ p@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the corporate view , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation of the displayed object . set here the path to your document re@@ tention and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ ti@@ dd@@ les ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you enter files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also use the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first folded file will be used .
the color for wire models . the second colour is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second colour is used for displaying the selected controls .
the color of the rectangle for the field view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characters .
you can adjust the object @-@ cat@@ cher of points to the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can set the grid separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values give an more accurate wire model and a better sewing speed for the displayed object , but require more time to rendering . for some objects like the ball you can set the detail stage for two directions .
when you cross an advanced projection for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided , if the camera offers extended proj@@ ections with exceptions to perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property represents a better r@@ appro@@ ch@@ ement for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is shifted . the wall will be displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colors .
if you cross the floor , there will be a bottom below the object . the floor will be displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colors .
if you want to activate cant@@ at@@ ement method , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the rendering of scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling can be adjusted . more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender modes .
on this page , you can modify existing window positions or create new window orders . in the section window orders , you can create and save window orders .
the combination field standard @-@ window rules : displays all existing window positions . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . uses the selected window rules at the start of the program .
the list Ex@@ t@@ ant window positions shows all existing shut@@ ting orders . a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with button Remove .
any window rules will be identified by the name . the name must be clear and cannot be empty .
the list below the name displays all views of the chosen window rules . new views may add to Create and delete selected views with button Remove .
the position of the new window . with new column lets you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with bottom card you will receive a card card viewing together with the previous view and the view is not in the main window , but generates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is installed and now you would like to follow any more accurate knowledge of both programs . when you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should easily create the ultimate : a sphere on one level .
but you should keep the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain about the result that you will only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t use camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you will get a black picture .
if you do not include light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black picture .
if you have any fault @-@ free installed , you see the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; the following pre @-@ installed window rules :
take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar . read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable idea what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols now , therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to remove this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object . select the scene and then select the menu entry dialog . that &apos;s why you have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera sees all the scene you create . especially note that in the fourth wire @-@ model ( right below ) , this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of view object properties , where the various parameters of the camera will find . in the user documentation for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details .
change nothing at the basic settings of the camera , however , note that the camera in the view point has to change , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button user or the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree are immediately dependent on these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view@@ point of the camera .
there are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene . you could adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a constant method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler is actually an easy way to use . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object , change the name and press the button user or the input button . in the object tree , the new name is instantly displayed .
the wire @-@ model @-@ view also shows the level as well as at the moment only as a limited level . if you render the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you see the object tree , you will notice that you can fold the entry to the bottom of the object . in this case you will see only the default settings of object . in this case you can see only the default settings for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change possible settings in the view of the object characteristics .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to mark some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first , choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit several times in the moment .
in both cases a dialog box opens up in which you can choose how the object will be inserted . the pigment will then change the name in the property view ( name = floor @-@ pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course you can preview the preview of pigments only a matte black material , because you are still waiting to preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click . also , there are many possibilities now , but take it the easiest way .
if you are looking to preview the color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click first on the button users and then click the preview .
the material for the ground is right now set . if you want your picture now with a click on the symbol ren@@ ders , you should receive the following result :
of course you are not able to enter the color chart . here are additional settings required . in the color list you need to do two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the d@@ ashboard colour list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the object in any object and change the colours in the view of the object characteristics :
this step should you already run , as you should have the basic working methods of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . already , the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in the view of object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : 1 ( forget not to push the input or the button . otherwise , the sphere has been h@@ ed over the ground , as you have shifted the floor to a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ ders now results in a self @-@ like result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . set in the following step .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now show a material now . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as colour :
for example , choose the object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on ball pigment , then select unic@@ ycle and adjust the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the user or press the input button .
the settings of shine @-@ effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome finish , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression you who offers you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler . hop@@ efully , you have already learned as much as you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a r@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. , by the camera that reflects the scenes ) by each pixel of the scene , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and like the atmospheric effects of the light sources in the scene , and how atmospheric effects appear to work . so the scene pixels are processed for pixel .
as you can imagine , you will not see a camera without seeing the camera , with which you consider the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simple . obviously , each scene will need , some light sources and at least one camera .
in common file dialog you can choose your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler .
whenever you open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
have you already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and enter a storage space .
exhibits the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage has been rejected .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last reverse order . this menu entry can only select if you have processing the pre@@ set .
records the current window rules and opens up a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or address an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and change the standard behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or modify them with this option . you can change or add new commands to this option .
opens a dialog for setting up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove the tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a possibility to assemble a smo@@ ker surface without any hi@@ ves at the surface , and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric forms that you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundred of these basic bodies . these models will then continue to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying a image file as a color chart .
the application features a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application features a file browser that you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed in either own window in the size of the image or full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or return Return .
you can set whether any image can be displayed in one window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a particular file , just type the first sign of the file in browser window . then a small input field appears in the right corner . when a pass@@ able file is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog One - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; available in three cards , General and machining and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the working methods of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short fault for the display windows and short errors for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , then the images will be open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area with the background color is filled , which you can adjust further down . the default is no full screen mode .
if this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still use the actual picture . this reduces the delay if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the end of the last opened folder . at the next start a ch@@ ase show ; this folder will be opened in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . it &apos;s used to fill in the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color here .
you can find &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ener ; so that only some of the file types will be displayed that the program can also display .
this option is extended for large pictures the display windows to the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
select whether the sli@@ deshow should begin with the first picture in the folder or with the selected picture .
the time span between image changes in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the little arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated while repe@@ ating the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der , or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here , change the short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the boxes for display windows and short errors for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub @-@ folders and a window for files ) and a partial view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
features large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in brief selection .

the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which can be found mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of a collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists for the D@@ COP @-@ function break &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ ok has even some separate command @-@ options options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all necessary modules are present and use the dialog to allow the user to pass why a script is not running .
desire &quot; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is . for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog , sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts , or simply determine that the writing of scripts are relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should be finished .
most scripts themselves enable the purpose of external programs and commands . in addition , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually called ex@@ its &gt; relatively easy . here an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends al@@ ings to all the scripts themselves . for this reason , scripts are to monitor their default input and react differently to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure the script to view the setup dialog . to save the saving and load of setup data , you need to take care of each script itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the job folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ change sign@@ alized that a new piece is played . the script could now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions will ask more information about the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ al@@ izes a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize the menu to the selected files in the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu entry may also be checked , so that the script can use the clicked image file . to remove one entry again , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script AT@@ e@@ Custom@@ ized Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ men@@ it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok itself ; or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do for example cleaning and configuration settings . to this end , for example , the saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok@@ s script management can also install script packages that can be compressed by users &amp; z@@ b ; such packages are basically normal T@@ sar @-@ archives ( .t@@ ar ) that can optionally be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so the user may clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ an@@ script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main cre@@ pt should be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remainder of the modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ sar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to the Vi@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org . you can attach the link to the Vi@@ i script side of &amp; am@@ arok ; you should install the category am@@ arok on your favorite screen .

import the play@@ lists : causes that &amp; am@@ arok branches ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection will later be added later in the play@@ list browser .
the part Collec@@ tive database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver is used , you can choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . when MySQL is selected , further facility in the sub@@ window is necessary .
the MySQL facility is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ arok branches ; using this calcul@@ ator , the machine is entered where the MySQL database is entered . after this , it is reachable under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data that you need to connect to the database .
the card load bal@@ m specifies the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok ; can super@@ v@@ ise the names of played pieces at a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create online recommendations regarding the current list .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile you can sign up one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
manually send pieces and updating the profile : this setting enables it &amp; am@@ arok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .

&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen shots .
am@@ aro@@ K needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs installed so you need some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts . we have written a small guide on how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager will require the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ t@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will therefore work with trouble . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will probably make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can see this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also impos@@ e the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and release the collection again .
mostly , this is that Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file crashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try out SQ@@ Lite . the support is in &amp; am@@ arok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all the libraries used by &amp; am@@ arok ; used to comp@@ ile libraries with the same compiler version . if e.g. &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x was compiled , then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate automatically if in@@ active for ... to setup the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ side by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically closed with a crash ) . if it is an frequently occurring crash , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is found that many program data is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ info but not as Unicode aware , but the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag , print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; error while writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ pli@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ pli@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ arok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / recovery / dynamic play@@ list ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbols can be simply forgotten under the appearance icons . please do the status de@@ activ@@ ates to grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases it is necessary to click on a symbol until this setting its effect .
if you get this error : symbol L@@ ook@@ up error : infinite symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Ar@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf like that am@@ aro@@ K is the correct version first .
there are some options . most of the installation problems are clear by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or by the developers . they use the Forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # 1 .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help . please note there only one error if you find something on the device of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ arok ; only a blank play@@ list will appear . how do music pieces come there ?
that is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag files to the right part of the play@@ list .
in order to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window was converted into the statistics window . it is included in extr@@ as Statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate these pieces in the play@@ list , the evaluation list is displayed . click the title bar of the play@@ list and select column . click here to specify the evaluation of a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
select the files you want to remove and press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from play@@ list box from the drop @-@ down menu .
draw a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would do it with other files . it &apos;s just that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the adding button , the button play@@ list is displayed . click on it .

if you use the G@@ ay @-@ S@@ ink , use the device to use a mixer . a mixer allows multiple uses to use the device at the same time and to run simultaneously audio . this can be achieved by a sound@@ card with hardware mix@@ ers ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ star@@ ters you might need to specify a different sc@@ ink ( e.g. tr@@ sink ) .
doing so . do not forget that media needs to be de@@ coded . you can just listen to ALL the best choice if you are looking for a dec@@ or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . gr@@ amer can deliver directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Dri@@ vers ( really great ! ) or optim@@ ise the settings of Arts . open sound@@ files with highest priority priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( see next point at the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ D co@@ de@@ cs , which can cause them to cause . read this error report . the enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ oun@@ dr@@ c can also help too .
either do not use the Arts drivers but instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ like &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts d@@ ffer in control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the less the buffer , the less applications react the visu@@ al@@ izations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please contact us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I would like to switch to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; am@@ arok branches off . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . perform G@@ ST register to record all G@@ lim@@ b components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( termin@@ ate am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Char@@ m@@ peg download it , comp@@ ile and install it . then execute G@@ ST @-@ config ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ tr@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again and run G@@ ST @-@ Registry . now you start &amp; am@@ arok branches .

after you have made all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; please press the button Start . now you see a dialog box which looks like that or something like :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of copy . as soon as the reading of the original file is completed , you will be asked after an empty CD @-@ medium that the data will be burned .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; bur@@ ns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; bur@@ ns the image file . you have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T @-@ Designer Tool U@@ IC can not find the &amp; k@@ de ; wid@@ get modules can not be found . to fix this problem to add q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search engine for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder by &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , and you can get the latest version of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; also you can get rid of the feedback from the for@@ ums and learn news .
if you want &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program is burning audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at Once mode or DA@@ O ) based on an ex@@ changeable description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ is@@ ofs ; : bur@@ ns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; usually , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs out . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as a Ripper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ code . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for any loss of audio compression and compression compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ sn@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : further libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files , then de@@ cryp@@ t to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a program that can convert between different audio formats and may be used . SO@@ X is used from the SO@@ X Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for the video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : an operating range of equipped auth@@ oring system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bler and analyze video CDs and Super @-@ video CDs .
standard alize : this tool will be useful for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , e.g. to create the mixed x@@ ten CD &apos;s and Mp3 Colle@@ ctions , the different recordings of the various albums may lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces may vary widely according to the un@@ beautiful effect .
e@@ Mov@@ ix : here is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to play from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a comfortable way , recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . a click on a record will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ames . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all open projects . this is the same as if you want to save for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after , what should be done . you can then choose between save and changes . furthermore , you can shut down and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is to ask for any in@@ stored project what should be done so as if you have called for each project file .
conclu@@ des all open projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for any in@@ stored project , it will be asked what should be done so as if you had called file Cl@@ ose .
if you enter this entry , you can select the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project has already contains data .
open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can create many projector settings . each project types has different possible settings , most of them are described ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this is useful if you &apos;re not using files for a multi@@ disciplinary session CD . this is useful if you &apos;re not using files for a multi@@ disciplinary session . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . this function is automatically removed from the current project . all other files will be removed from the current project . this function removed no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only those imported files again .
open the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on another media . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then prefer to burn later . also , there is also possibility to copy some of the cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should also copy Cl@@ one if you want to copy CDs with damaged sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to create copying a DVD onto any other medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn a copy of a DVD using copying dialog . furthermore , you can also be able to burn the target media to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
open the dialog for Del@@ ete of a CD @-@ RW . you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for forming a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , reducing the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; gives you the choice between writing modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
bur@@ ns a burn CD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ rescue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can immediately be burned immediately when pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not yet supported , you have to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
bur@@ ns a burn DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source that can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously le@@ ached DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but may also be used individually . it contains information about the appropriate video , codi@@ fication settings and even possibilities to change the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the specified medium . these information will be displayed in the syn@@ op@@ sis and include features of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when a record is crossed , the tool bar is visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small glue will be displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar will be bl@@ ends .
when the folder view is or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also shown an context menu with functions such as media Info , lock and lock the media .
when the view view is a or off . the summar@@ ize view enables the selection and drag of files into the project view . the summar@@ izing is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder .
for this purpose , the coupler is a narrow range , which contains only visible when the project view has open projects . the coupler has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ections clear from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog for changing the key assign@@ ments for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you have chosen one of the available orders in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment here below .
this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup @-@ based per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore system administrator privileg@@ es are required , therefore you need to enter the password to the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can perform general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b should work on An@@ h@@ ie@@ b . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a sh@@ ell@@ scription .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions can be used , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or that is slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are basically identical , therefore rather your taste and the type of task is crucial , which means the bit@@ ing programs you enter .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p program to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter the following console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program gem@@ s , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts listed below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; introduces functions like cop@@ y@@ CD , format DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mov@@ i@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mov@@ i@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mov@@ i@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mov@@ i@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mov@@ i@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mov@@ i@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ ref cre@@ at@@ e@@ Mov@@ i@@ x@@ DVD@@ Project ( ) . cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) . cop@@ y@@ D@@ vd ( ) The Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d ( ) . Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) . Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one obt@@ ains a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) , you can obtain a project via the command line via # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then change a reference to the project via using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above mentioned K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
the cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) The cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) is ad@@ ored ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) , Q@@ String Par@@ ent , The Q@@ string path , Q@@ String Par@@ ent , The Black String ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) .
with it , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ e@@ cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fol@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der da@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der / home / tru@@ st@@ ice / do@@ fil@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; Easy o@@ cre@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s read and can be saved in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . also other formats are possible depending on the encoder the installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( comp@@ ress &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers , who need these wav @-@ files ( loss of compression ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional co@@ axial cables must be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of &amp; CD ; read and compressed in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files are normally compressed in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has been compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this has to be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers must be installed . all these programs are generally available for any Linux distri@@ butions , it is probably not necessary to comp@@ ile anything else . if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
the encoding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer provides a small introduction of coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; cran@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection . if not the firmware of the copy protection is not possible . even avoid the copy of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once must be done ( the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , will be explained to the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hop@@ efully ) to compreh@@ end the slim approach of user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which co@@ axial programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can I get &amp; CD ; get more information from the fre@@ ed@@ b or can work in any network without any network .
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . at the side step by step example , more information , such as this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program .
on request , the CD@@ DB is on request of the CD data according to the installation of the CD@@ DB regi@@ sters . ( this may be locally or online in the latter case , first the connection to the Internet must first be made . )
starts reading and when a Encoder has been configured in the Control@@ lers tab in the setup catalogue - coding .
a sub @-@ menu opens with a list of available encoder , so that the choice with any other encoder can be read as the default . it is too aware that the encoder included in the tab setting settings dialog .
open the file manager so that a already used file to en@@ code will be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main dialog for &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; available with different card cards ( such as encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . go right before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ axial and compression ratios , and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ ers .
if no audio @-@ file should be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; hormone &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , probably available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available non @-@ commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats used by data comp@@ ressing according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG files today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but via this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important , since both co@@ aches create very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions of free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( for high bit rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or when one of the few exist@@ ent OGG files is present .
MP3 - if music is also shown on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - do these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting would usually offer acceptable for most people and most of the music of acceptable transparency , and has already very high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate of up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate of about . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enough for music of teenagers , portable devices and auto @-@ control systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you definitely want to have the absolute highest quality without view on the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that are manually entered or transferred by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available as a list of parameters . you can be handed over / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; and the code name to create the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is frequently a combination of program settings for the code and the parameters here . the manual or the help to the code editors Expl@@ ain the switches for these programs .
for example to add CD &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3s are encoded with l@@ ame , the switch @-@ d@@ d must be added from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { Shift } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; parameters which can be used ( = button @-@ label of the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which the audio CDs can be loaded , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer . it is too note that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ c@@ m. ) is not attor@@ ney . however , no one can stop that you are added by the &amp; CD ; more or less value , so can neither the artist nor the music company damage . all information can be understood in a bund@@ le through a &amp; CD ; store , physically or virtually .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; is active a check box address ( S@@ end of an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used in the retri@@ eve of the server ( This can only know the programmer , who has checked the code . )
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; for use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the geographical closest of the next door server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and equals the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online call of &amp; CD ; or else you can download the whole database or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what is the reader program used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to be more specific to check in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see Please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done .
to save the le@@ vi@@ able WAV files , the code can be selected and the required file format are used . during the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used . for more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are listed in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coefficient , you can receive further information about its switch through the input of a command @-@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device of the device recording of &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read list@@ ens to both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio co@@ incidence of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that may indicate what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not prosp@@ er !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give these tips as you must proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood but are somehow still uns@@ af@@ e what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step by step example , and you will get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all setup and our first &amp; CD ; read , we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps to average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not completely free software , since it is not necessary to comp@@ ile source files , what you can always do .
please ensure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd is and that you own write permission to it ( eg ; by attemp@@ ting to copy it with the quer@@ quer@@ or to copy ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; something that is thought to be done only once and
the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for any CD &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the use code for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we divide the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it in any case of any &amp; CD ; change if the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the password program so that it can read &amp; CD ; data / music can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device recording of your drive . if this is not working or when more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , if a try into the file / etc / f@@ stab an attempt to get existing entries of the device drawings for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map card General Settings . here you can &apos;t do much too . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown in the screenshot as shown in screen photo .
only for un@@ complete information please select that you will be informed when information regarding messages of lit@@ eral ( tags ) are missing .
the map chart CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and run the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading &amp; CD ; can be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag names , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Con@@ qu@@ anti@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually fill the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b . however , this is about 620 MB large , if you want to use the database before . however , this will be selected twice if you need to check out in open mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eve the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the internet . how to get the system that data should get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . read all such as shown in screen photo .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the database on the Internet Server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and look after a mirror image nearby . on this way the load between the host is distributed . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both function reliably prevents the server , since many Fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 standard regularly , there is maybe more than@@ k@@ ful with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we want no &amp; CD ; data transmitted to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . the first check box should be sufficient .
simply take the settings of a screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is found on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one another drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore just trying to try it .
CD ; after reading the last piece : do this cruci@@ fy around the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
custom file for temporary files : if you cross this cruci@@ ble , then it must be saved in which the WAV files can be saved . if only space on another drive is specified , the box will not be checked in the private folder . if you don &apos;t forget this folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files .
everything that is based on the screen photo . the order is slightly long , under circumstances , something has to be b@@ lown to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
notice the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the production of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may be deleted as required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; day for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of late change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this sample :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that is , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described , such as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk drive , the kind of music is organized on the hard drive , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be found in this section , must be repeated for any audio &amp; CD ; it must be repeated in this section .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , see screen pictures a bit differently than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully accessed by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually as@@ sign them from the internet . comments are noted on the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as described in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this is not done , then search in the section questions and answers after the Help or go back to previous section concerning the default settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks of the pieces are completed and additionally the name of the artist and album will be displayed .
for the case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will be built , and you can select the database entry that your opinion fits best to your &amp; CD ; fits perfectly .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; default in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also retri@@ eve it manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t collect local database , you will need the link to the internet .
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the item in the first line of the &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not have to enter into the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ ps per piece , the Com@@ ment@@ ary field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words with big letters or not ... ) , but also to verify if there are any un@@ wanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; maximum this option is set on the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ aser Properties tab , and take a look into the section &apos; Fundam@@ ental Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the created files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the coefficient for coding , to obtain more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious to the style of the advert@@ ised CD ; in this example , this is not important when we do not provide the &amp; CD ; data are not covered anyway . for more information about the website of fre@@ ed@@ .@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD player appears again and you see that the fields for the album has already been recorded with the entered data , which we have listed for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item . the titles of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure click the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear when you downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is sorted in one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of one piece . only the titles are selected or out . make sure that all tracks are selected , or manually fill the Select all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at a time .
when clicking on the button selection , the read process is started , so this window appears to confirmation . click OK then and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the riders on orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the com@@ missions . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message can be seen when you are trying to work with a coefficient , which have not yet been installed . they are not successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the application list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , check out and en@@ code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress the behaviour . the only thing that seems to read , the number of parallel processes is the result un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous read and en@@ code ( of however , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order in the waiting time of the body is coded . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message is built in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x resp . 4.x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you will need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; if you know in the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S is part of the k@@ ed@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . most distri@@ butions you can already have an anonymous program , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to people , compiled by the source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help with the program you can adapt to your needs if it goes once , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of the settings . best , you can read the step by step example of the settings and settings . it displays photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on to the initial start of the program , without any point out of program ( especially if the program starts at the time of program , there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who likes it , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not re@@ vo@@ ke this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cre@@ ator ; who can still do something of use with the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and is therefore agree with this proposal .
strange if it has succeeded in fet@@ ch the source file by &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has no real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke @-@ real templates of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ mid ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is based on as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ ence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the light @-@ text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighted keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can catch in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from a &amp; stop ; window to spro@@ ut .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( son@@ g@@ writer or tex@@ turing ) . K@@ Mid calcul@@ ates automatically the procedures used .
sitting assist . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid starts next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears to be the usual file dialog where you can choose the desired song .
you can also read a file by a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window will be covered in &amp; k@@ mid ; window will also work with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and beat the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry down from the menu on or entered the empty space .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece starts automatically once you move it onto &amp; k@@ mid ; - windows . ( at several pieces they will be added to a collection and then retri@@ eved one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive them with the knob .
if you find a song for fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template . to get the original speed , double click on the template - LCD .
the empty space has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break off the menu or choose the menu folder in the menu , interrup@@ ts the playback . entered the empty space during no piece , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; play back .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces using text gra@@ dients , other use li@@ ed@@ t@@ earing and another . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events should be displayed and even better : the event model is automatically determined , so that you need to adjust it manually . if you want to change the kar@@ aoke text , you will always have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set out a event type , select the entries from the menu settings or rec@@ itals . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these will be played the series after you . in this section it stands as you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , open the collection manager first . this will find in the menu collection under the point .... Click there to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than a collection , you can set the data required in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying the application , this collection will not be stored . consider that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you need to add a Song . there you can add a song with the button . it appears in turn the file dialog where you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece when opening ( Open or drag &amp; drop ) is added automatically to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the Collec@@ tors Manager that select the collection and the desired song , then click Remove .
you can select the order where the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song , select the next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the knob preceding piece , the entry predic@@ table piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the Collec@@ tors Manager , select the collection , and click on the button .
the temporary collection may not be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter if they are not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ izers that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ Events transl@@ ates into events that understand syn@@ thes@@ izers .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and is therefore always a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you must edit the appropriate file by hand ( using your favorite d@@ itor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file which stores all necessary modifications for the playback of a piece it stores .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . however , however , each occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
define P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define PRO@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you can see that it is needed to indicate that one section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , that I can operate in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices which are not general @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section it is specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equality is igno@@ red . it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds which need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a net surplus . in addition , you take the following in P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so , if now , a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( def@@ enses ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is written in MIDI file .
please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant with that each tone is a more percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one that means sound the pitch of the always the same drum means ( as some keyboards possess it ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is used to specify sounds like tones on a defined channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Ke@@ ym@@ on for each channel and each instrument . you must only use different names in the first line .
Ke@@ ym@@ is will be used especially to form tones on the percussion @-@ channel . watch out as an example the supplied Ke@@ ym@@ on .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to replace the first and second channel , make this very simple in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following model :
n is the channel that is shown on channel N . if you use the key@@ word option , the Key@@ map will continue to be defined in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will ignore all events that will change the patch on this channel . in this case , then patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the percussion patch on the per@@ cus@@ o channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Is is divided in which ratio of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der occurr@@ ences will be multiplied by the value n , this with the formula one * ( r / 4096 ) is converted and then only rel@@ ayed to the value . the value 4096 is used to be stored in the map file ( r / 4096 ) .
this setting is needed because GM is giving up a keyboard , which should play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards up to one octave is higher than to play the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the MIDI Settings menu . you will find the menu settings dialog , item MIDI settings .
the channel view is a window with a full range of cl@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see that sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . if you have changed a instrument , if you have changed a instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view in the menu settings below the point of view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed that a song is played , the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you see e.g. , a song may be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about it has to be played like a piece of music . it contains notes , the speed , speed , etc ; so that you can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians who can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can h@@ em@@ it , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; which has been compiled because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example , k@@ mid ; &apos;s start )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
agree that supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; choose all files from and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows .
automatically enable the automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can see the arrow button on the left of the template to slow down playback . in order to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desk a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file , or if I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window will change and drag the file to the window by &amp; k@@ mid ; .
if you want to listen to a file only if you want to add a file without creating a collection , turn off the automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will add a temporary collection to add files
let &apos;s assume you only want to play the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d . thus , you want to set the automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d your temporary collection , then you will find exactly this a MIDI file .
then do you have to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
those people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , animated me the , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I am in the third year , so that I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to get some time for my Hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , music and phr@@ ases .

a sound card . I recommend you to use a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because sound quality is much dependent on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound card you need to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the MO@@ DE _ DEM@@ O _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it &apos;s then if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if any problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; ma@@ iling lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files created by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not terminated than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
check the page The K@@ DE website for additional help , or check the question about The &amp; k@@ de ; user Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ ble windows . there is always the window with central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed if it will be shown in it .
it is possible to add the preferred connections below the menu . if you want to create a list of entries you want to play together after each other , you should use the Category Permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain additional hier@@ arch@@ es . if you copied one entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and play it with the clicked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and Dau@@ gh@@ ty play@@ list may also be changed through direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only choose one of a category click here , but also by application itself . simply click on a name of a category click here to select an sub @-@ group . due to the image of a sub @-@ group , the XML contents will be shown only .
after changing XML files , the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost if the editing mode is selected or any other group is selected with the play@@ list box .
due to the convenience of the author by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation at starting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ list and changing &#91; General Visual &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / credit / k@@ m@@ player / exc@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format has to be a supported XML file .
the animation does not need to be short , it will be automatically terminated by opening a different source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive , the user can therefore termin@@ ate the application a second time .
a simple example of a Start animation may be the ad of a favorite photos ; lt . ; lt ; &amp; lt . / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; Me@@ et &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt . / sm@@ ite ; In the directory of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL the by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are supported .
there is a rider on configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here the path from the M@@ Player and the intermediate memory size of the data stream will be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar from k@@ m@@ player . here is the issue of m@@ player available .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example such as a &apos; flash with the module sw@@ f @-@ Mozilla based :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog for assign@@ ments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a console application and to search for error messages . if there are no faul@@ ts process , the default output is to check the back@@ end output in &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
therefore always a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a specific anim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , it must be done by manual changing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on to play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards either by means of M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner must be used by the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually from the configuration dialog .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) Settings in the box is to use the dialog for Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , of which one needs to be found . ( i.e. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB to it .
since the V@@ DR is supported by k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video , X@@ Video should also work . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion for the X server must be functional . for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internal names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of creating this documentation this d@@ v@@ d@@ n@@ av@@ ant , source , source , source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , they start playing the play@@ list .
is there any evidence that I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not v@@ cd : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is available as user root after the integration of the device . ensure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + creating graphical user surface and network support and is needed for comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional character application . under Unix systems probably will be accessed on the package and tex@@ as ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux distribution boxes . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation disc should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; c@@ rop@@ es ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ile ; website included .
this manual is available for everyone - regardless of experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; lin@@ ux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions regarding documentation can be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation desired , the contact with the k@@ ile ; website should be made .
questions regarding or when comp@@ iling &amp; c@@ ile ; on or , extensions , this should be addressed to the ma@@ iling list c@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ster@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ area for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ area for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; - functions in an graphical user interface and within this one simple , immediate and custom tools within the source code as well as conversion tools for these . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; Reference and the powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to find out the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly with the reading of the chapter &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct post@@ ure : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if the origin of the original &amp; tex ; if it is easy to use , also an av@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros is able to use a less sophisticated but more realistic detection is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
here , just a good access to &amp; lat@@ ex ; is it not the ultimate book . by &amp; lat@@ ex ; right there is not the ultimate book . by H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. Dal@@ y , A Guide to &amp; Lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just as other ex@@ pressing languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to the general properties like paper format , side number@@ ing and text is specified with the instruction \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed again with the order \ \ Beg@@ in { document } and must be closed down with the order \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is an important feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the choice of assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers several options for creating the document . there may also be some of the document @-@ related settings .
document classes : hereby the type of the document must be referred to : article ( article &#93; , book &#91; Report &#93; , letter &#91; Report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ p@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Pro@@ b &#91; Safety &#93; , Pro@@ jection &#91; Pro@@ jection &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
coding : the encoding process will be used . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding than default . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the binding , they are only balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use in the preparation of German texts .
new users can now make no wor@@ ries . it is just a short description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; - as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ matching ) . due to &amp; k@@ ile ; it is certainly not noticed by the modest appearance of output files . however , it is possible to save you through the modest appearance of output files . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and
with automatic adjustment of environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ Beg@@ in { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a space line ( for input the text ) and the added line to connect the command . this function can be disabled in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; consider the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ tle the lowest element ) :
at the view of the document in the structure of the structure , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the end .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when using a DVI ; file &#91; rendered file &#93; &#93; , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewing to the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information as the font , and is available in addition to PDF the current output type by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , conversion and printing from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the run@@ k search , the elements of the DVI ; file is clicked on the editor in the DVI ; file by clicking on a element in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . once on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was clicked on the corresponding passage in the DVI ; viewer .
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified using other integrated .@@ tex files . if the use of a project can be set up a project @-@ wide Master @-@ Document about Project Properties .
quick : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( if no errors found in the code ) .
file size : in this mode the DVI ; file on the whole mode is enabled , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; following the rapid construction .
considering the editing tool bar , the three large selection areas should be found within the document . the first selection field is designed for fast integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Further is for inser@@ ting articles , such as words , joints , notes or references . the indicated days are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection field ) .
when using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary entries will be displayed . the author does not only work if the file is needed for a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files you can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name of the font is used for the determination of the font . it is possible to set the title for the main text , the joints , etc . , the following font is available .
when calling &amp; c@@ ile ; there are two selection options for creating a new document by selecting the document type and legend of settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason .
the brackets according to the instruction \ \ docum@@ ent@@ s.@@ Keep the settings for the command . the signature &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not specified at the beginning , this will also happen in the text .
once the above source code has been entered &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to use is the use of the menu of building or the button .
the source must be stored before the compilation . &amp; ster@@ ile ; for storage , the storage is automatically saved .
the compilation of the document , should be sought after the faul@@ ts . when using rapid construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this case should not be started . if this is not the case , the log will also be kept .
an environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font is made of 12 . the order \ \ Beg@@ in { Reg@@ . } , \ \ The \ \ \ \ \ \ Change { Reg@@ . } , the title of the font is to be ad@@ mi@@ red inside the surroundings .
the changes will be careful in the vicinity ( from \ \ Beg@@ in { environment } to \ \ \ \ \ The environment } ) , there is no restrictions ( number ) for changes within a environment .
there are many possibilities to recover the read and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain font , fat pressure , cur@@ sive print , sub@@ types , etc . these commands are either complete with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ Beg@@ in { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course pressure and is long as long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ t } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ Beg@@ in { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background for writing the source text by the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language is shown , then a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in the assistant , a little text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document must be completed . to this , minim@@ ally a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive print and a po@@ em to the application to see the differences of these commands .
as soon as the document has been viewed , the editor or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in internal viewer ) . an external viewer must be closed during an external viewer .
once the DVI ; file created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is a file format file format ( English , V e V ice I n@@ ly ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the reading of some drivers from the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi format such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file or computer screen TVs .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document are possible ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then you can print the document using file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows converting the converting of DVI ; file in different formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin to open any other formats with the button in the tool bar .
the prefer@@ r@@ esho@@ oting is available for the direct jump from the editor to the da@@ zz@@ ling position within the DVI ; -@@ File .
&amp; ster@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries for any &amp; lat@@ ex ; for this purpose only modern can be setup under the settings ... tools can be selected .
in order to be used for the presentation , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned in one line of the source code and connect to the corresponding spot in DVI ; viewer is then done .
using this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; associated with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the respective &amp; lat@@ ex ; file size &amp; lat@@ ex ; may be specified and specified for the appropriate line . these must be specified in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; editor and ey@@ epi@@ ece ( default of ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
if using fast @-@ making of the &amp; DVI ; viewer cannot be possible , an error should be available . should a mistake appear then displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file format gives the error source in the source code . in the editor then the buttons will always be used between the errors . in order to consider the faul@@ ty line , the error code has to be clicked on the error in the log box and jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once the button is clicked on the button bar , a window appears to choose the set of the template for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
with a selection of empty document , a document can be written either by the ground or the assistant for fast creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section .
basic user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; c@@ ile ; stored , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
in order to create a new template , you need to create a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file size can be created or create a new file using the curtains of an existing document and a selection of file template from the document ... create .
when creating a new document , some strings can be replaced by different data ( e.g. name or drawing di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) . these variables will be setup to settings ... Settings is setup .
to create your own template , it is therefore necessary to know what character strings are replaced by which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by the input in docum@@ ent@@ aries . typically , it will be used : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ ail &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { # $ &#93; .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the instructions for the commands at the editor . once the document was done in this way , the following steps should be completed :
when creating a new document , the own template will be balanced instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . a simple way to create a template , should search for one on the Internet and are carried through the steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the opportunity of reading and high@@ ways of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; available in Men@@ Ã ¼ Tools directly from &amp; C@@ ile ; released .
to find out more about b &amp; Kate ; and his participation should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be found there directly with the reading of the chapter &amp; Kate .
&amp; ster@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command re@@ ference that can be called for the menu of the La@@ Te@@ X reference manual . they contains an exceptional description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; using , and its syntax .
double @-@ click with attached C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; that means that this way to clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p is only \ \ par .
when drawing the text with embossed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow fast@@ ing with embossed switching of the spring button can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; ster@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse the most different types of source codes , and these differ . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands of normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants added to this trampoline . in this case , there is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . this j@@ umping mark is highlighted by the jump to the current or last j@@ umping mark . this jumps will also be replaced by the first input of a character .
the processing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; c@@ rop@@ ex ; although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding quality options were added in &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for their selection . &amp; lat@@ ex ; available always many environments and groups and therefore under@@ stand@@ ably the following commands for the text @-@ selection are :
however , a complete set of ( group of lines containing on both sides have an empty line ) . this extended meaning has to connect tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code ; is therefore that the absence of sections were separated by two blank lines .
if the word is covered by the current cur@@ sor position . this command also has an extended meaning as this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a yield point ( \ \ ) and an enclosed star ( * ) at the end .
to find a part of the document , nat@@ Ã ¼ r@@ assing is considered to be removed by pressing the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the key collection of C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with own commands from this , the following commands are contained in the text of the text :
remov@@ es a complete paragraph . the definition for a par in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit articles .
it has already been clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; so it offers &amp; c@@ rop@@ es ; for further orders under editing environment , for a fully automated working with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the surrounding area .
with this command , at the end of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } is located at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
with the input of many prescribed ambient commands can quickly pass the view . this command fell the most recently restored environment , so that the surrounding environment will not be moved .
&amp; ster@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ x group there are some important commands that comply with machining surroundings .
the cur@@ sor is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the large chamber .
with this command , at the end of the current group convers@@ ations ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the clamp wall .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the soft Kl@@ ammer einer &amp; tex ; group # is located , will be performed at the other end of the group ( or vice vers@@ a ) .
during the entering of many different group brackets , the par@@ enth@@ es@@ es can be lost rapidly . this command will be close to the most recently published structure of the &amp; tex ; groups can not be saved .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two easy beginnings as go@@ dd@@ les are used . for the implementation of the initial course , the sign &quot; is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and it is responsible for two quick initial designs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this automatic adjustment of the double beginn@@ er marks can be setup and follow under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
there are also many other languages ( such as n@@ ar or French ) and thus German or French beginn@@ er sign can be used . there are also many other languages available .
during the screening of Shift ; enc@@ ro@@ ofs for a smart line break . if the current position is in a list -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , is found ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
close to the tables can be connected &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end inter@@ ruption .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ p@@ ate pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments where you can create ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some users can arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby any E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) each other respec@@ t@@ ful . if this tab is not possible , for the current tab@@ ulator in the above . although this tab is not added , some intermediate space is added to the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code has been installed in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to have special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , there are three different modes . all of these modes are only able to set the automatic adjustment of these modes for different working modes .
in the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ Beg@@ in { Environment } will be &amp; ster@@ ile ; automatically add the order \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
by pressing the pin button , the final letter of the input is removed and is fully sc@@ aled down . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letters .
all commands are written down by a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are made up by selecting a command . alternatively , j@@ umping brands will be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions by edit de@@ pri@@ st@@ ings is possible and the same parameters will be added .
you can arrange the settings on these lists . you can choose a variety of different parts lists for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as for the general language used .
the command mode is not suitable for installation of environments . it will always have a few letters with \ \ Beg@@ in to be entered and the call of the finishing mode will be used as often used . on the other hand , the environments is used as often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for processing the environments is required .
when calling the case to be done by means of the fully processing environment or the key to the surrounding area Alt + Shift box , the command is done automatically and it appears \ \ Beg@@ in . thereafter , the environment can be done in sim@@ pl@@ est way and by pressing the input .
once this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; c@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a registered \ \ item command to be inserted .
in case of adjustments ; setup ... c@@ ile ; default settings can be performed to these lists . this mode uses the per@@ list of per@@ dition @-@ mode for &amp; tex ; - &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; ster@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of prints which are replaced immediately by le@@ ased string boxes . as an example of a down@@ gra@@ dation list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l serves as an example of the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word is led by means of the complete processing , or the key to the ab@@ brevi@@ ation C@@ l + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large waves are not helpful for the automatic combustion . however , it was found that many wounds have been written in a document more than once . thus it offers &amp; ster@@ ile ; the complete list for all already written down .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings ... K@@ ile default settings can also be split . here , the sw@@ elling value for the display of the damage can be specified .
the fully @-@ split files can be installed in sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / mode / mode / piece home folder . mode is available for waste water , Dictionary ( Dictionary ) , Dictionary .
the dialog box shows the insertion of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections and the chapters should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an outstanding basis for the changes and re@@ orders of pages . is the PDF output format , so you can re@@ generate the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools re @-@ arranged and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
in order to understand the result of the work , the source must be compiled . all the tools are group@@ ed into the menu of the compilation , creating and create a view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the additional conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command quick@@ ening , a viewer will usually be called after comp@@ ile . should not be used to connect a new window , then every time will be a new window .
a new project will be about the project new project .... And the following information will be asked for the project :
for the evaluation of the file names , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the samples of EC@@ MAS@@ TER@@ .@@ Ko@@ de . scripts are connected to the scripts in the vertical bars .
the API scripts are still not yet developed and can be found in further versions of &amp; c@@ rop@@ es ;
the first needs to be said that the transfer environment of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system@@ @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite well @-@ approved system , in which the basic functions will be expanded by a variety of large packages . offers a lot of various help to lower the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ ex ; they are supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the contained packages and an additional &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a fully @-@ wet re@@ mot@@ ions for &amp; tex ; and it &apos;s not only the description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for the search of a particular form@@ att@@ ing . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with those &amp; Tet@@ ex ; it is delivered , the finding of the correct document is not always simple . as a possible help , the small application ex@@ doc@@ to@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents , delivered documents and hier@@ archy for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the great advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or percussion . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the living space for the viewer for the document .

the version 3.2 by &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; all these tools use compression as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows the pro@@ c and how superior it is . do we still do it a piece , we give it a graphical user interface ; simply click on a terminal ! simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the pre@@ heated working folder , then remove the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work@@ folders and type them in the field of other folders to the desired folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted each time when the pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has been working on &amp; k@@ de ; documentation is already worked , knows how helpful this application . and with &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us there is now a superb graphic surface for it .
if the straight opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is then you can simply select the current application folder . if not , then choose up to date work folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to a copy on screen , your file is in@@ accurate . please check the reported errors and try again .

if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click on the Well @-@ based check selection .
for use of an &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in &amp; XML ; file selection , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) and specify the site of &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) and XML ; sch@@ ema as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG check , the specification of the defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; in the file selection is needed .
yes , &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the processing file in &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; already marked , then you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed file using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result is named , in . the file is usually saved in its native folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; do not need to do with &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can not wait until som@@ eb@@ ody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found down below .
in order to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin with the menu plug@@ ins and that the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage and add any new plug@@ ins contained . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search engine . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; Boo@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path leads to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often , in a project several people work together in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship between each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the top name of user and serves to identify clear identification .
one member can have several roles in project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project leader .
the user can choose from the list of the team members who it is . this happens by taking the team member from the list and ex@@ presses the list@@ ens . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and notes . see for further information about remarks .
in addition to the survey of the team , there is another advantage by the acquisition of the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team manager if something particular happens . see also for further information .
event actions are promotions to be executed if something particular happens in the project . one example would be able to see the opening of opening and closing a message if a file would be backed up , or a script that will play a file into the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog allows events to be edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the address data provided in the receiver list . the address at address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see , we@@ i such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following items :
note that note is simple . it can choose either the note document from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by identi@@ fying text .
remarks can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project of the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader According to the enrich@@ ment and sub@@ project names should be led , as in the examples below .
nick@@ names and roller name are independent of large or small sh@@ elling , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; quantitative l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD ag@@ nost@@ ic is and web @-@ based form@@ ating and scripts themselves supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here you will be treated via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be addressed via the settings of Qu@@ anta . this dialog box extends over a few pages that will be treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completes it can be changed . the entries are :
large / small ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of tags : large / small ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of automatically included tags . normal / Klein@@ sch@@ ema means , the tags will be inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of at@@ tri@@ butions : large / small ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of automatically enclosed attributes . normal big / small switching means the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if p@@ act , it is optional for tags , for which the exact day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
it can not close tags : as above , for all other tags , except simple tags .
start and conclusion : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice vers@@ a .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute signs in the respective coding during enem@@ a .
M@@ ime types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . using the button , the default pre@@ set can be restored .
standard encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way as with Open File Open files ( where encoding the file can be transferred ) , but this setting is exposed to the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files or used for files whose D@@ TD is not detected , but this setting is exposed to the project properties , if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; made with a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document of this backup can be recovered . this is not the same as the saving of the file . this is not the same as a backup regularly , according to the set time , created .
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editorial department or its own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface caused by changing the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depending on sight . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameters .
the warning messages section serves the control of the possibility to retri@@ eve al@@ arms by contact hook by no more questions .
the place for changing the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; you can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ising behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in divided mode . see modes for different modes .
here is the par@@ ser and the structure of the structure , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , in details .
in the mouse click on the structuring tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the structure construction with the mouse button .
in the structure @-@ tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actuators can be opened automatically when changing the structure . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element found in the current document .
the area for inser@@ ting ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded for many &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , it may be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause Ab@@ brevi@@ ation may be something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are the third page , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , on the most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in the insertion of a plug @-@ in must be specified :
address : the path to the plug@@ in when it is not possible at a standard site like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information will be handed to the plug@@ in when running in , so you can open the current file , the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Just @-@ read mode &quot; mode : check if this plug@@ in ref@@ uses to load the load . only real @-@ read @-@ k@@ parts usually refuse to load if this option is not chosen .
check out the plug@@ in : this is activated , then test@@ et &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , then if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting has been completely redesigned . does support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was discontinued , as well as the support for the D@@ BG deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implem@@ entations about plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in available which adds support for the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ co@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
the use of the monitor for a project starts with the selection of a matching de@@ bug plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; -@@ user interface :
a view that is displayed in the content of super@@ vised variables is usually displayed in the left dock .
a view that lists all the holding point , with line numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower Dock system .
a view that shows the output ( as in HTML ) of the Deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appears in the lower Dock .
depending on the supported functions of the monitor , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the connection will be made to de@@ bug , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug@@ in plug@@ in to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger . this action is opened by default when a project is used , so that normally a deb@@ ug@@ ger has to be considered .
the counter @-@ piece to de@@ bug meeting starts the meeting . closes the connection to the deb@@ ug@@ ger or end the listen to requirements .
transm@@ its a HTTP requirement to the server by a de@@ bug @-@ requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the opinion of Deb@@ ug@@ ger .
indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the scripts and the current run on the super@@ vis@@ ing variables as well as the current run run , the execution will be resum@@ ed . it happens before a de@@ bug has started , the script will start with the request .
shows the deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the version of the script without inform@@ ing any information to super@@ vised variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script is given , the version starts , as soon as a request is made .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next order in the script without going into the functions or include .
the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next order in the script , whereby it is possible when possible in functions and include .
indicates the deb@@ ug@@ ger that go over and go to the next such as if the current does not exist .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is super@@ vised . the super@@ vis@@ aged value appears in the variable .
this dialog allows to enter a variable or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; you can adapt to your needs and how to help you &amp; activities .
document type editing packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quantitative ; used to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scripts . your sim@@ plicity and flexibility makes it a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for Web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s , consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool bar . day folders are hand @-@ oriented , symbol@@ ising bars of images ( above the editing window ) that include text and orders faster into one document , than one user ever could .
&amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s may be created ( see below ) , download or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see details for details .
this document describes how the XML files are to be created , then the &amp; ter@@ at@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . short , one &amp; D@@ T@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property catalogue , the &amp; quantitative representation ; for the day shows . the schem@@ es and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool bar permit a fast insertion of tags in a document without any threat of a writing .
tag folder are nothing as a folder . you contain only the &amp; hin@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the daily XML @-@ files . tag folder bear the name of the writ@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the daily XML and if it is necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use , as many as possible , so many users can have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a daily XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it can &apos;t contain anything else about itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for day class class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ bute shelf and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( family 1 )
requires a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt . text &gt; Tag . this is an only element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute a tags . this item can only be used for every attri@@ bute . it lays the name and the type of attri@@ bute . additionally , there are additional tags that should be displayed as this attri@@ bute should be indicated &amp; etc . this is an only element type element .
gives the source code used for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attri@@ bute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quantitative time ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and an Methodi@@ st name . the arguments that will be handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , this means the name of the current tags .
a container day included the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for a attri@@ bute . it is an only element type element .
sets the position of the attributes within one dialog . this tag can occur only once for every attri@@ bute in one dialog ( e.g. once for every &amp; lt . att@@ r &gt; Tag ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and the size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ et@@ able tags . this element is an only element type .
is a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all day XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be wag@@ ered and closed .
space character influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and lt . signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tool@@ ing dialog box is up in the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; window to start and check the diary of the X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow .
this function is not yet available yet . at present , check only when loading the daily XML files in &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following example , for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; Element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
in the following example for a functioning family 2 day XML file . this file will be described in a &amp; PHP ; Over@@ load function . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt . ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt . tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; ac@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is a editor , reachable via D@@ TD Set@@ ting D@@ TD . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ ep@@ r@@ c ; for a new produced &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be used for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it should be created with following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; quantitative ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a Nick@@ name .
a action can be set up with Settings ... created . click on the new action to the same dialog :
this action @-@ weighted key short@@ cut . with clicking on the user can be assigned a button to be assigned ; with K@@ one is the current short@@ cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered in detail in the detailed settings and inserted into the document in the document of the current cur@@ sor position . see Example below .
this is the most powerful job type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) ; even the quick start @-@ up dialog or the various See can be found in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ EP@@ s .
first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter will be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ est variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There is other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file names are removed : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantitative ; when it works , the lyrics will be selected to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; it is used by the external script .
the parameter for this event normally , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the Project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script records of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; at the default location . in the selection box editing can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the requested application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal edition written to the standard output ; error messages written to the default written text is set , by the value the selection field output is set :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a custom tool bar . in this case , there are not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market .
as soon as a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure promotions . select settings .
the parts of this window are fairly self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the lower end of the window will start the editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar .
complete all and if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use , activate one day when available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? we replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol no more that the action will be represented better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graph more programs ( or where else is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used as standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ;
in mind that the day start , means I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually used as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user may be sign@@ alized , that clicking on this symbol will be taken ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol no , it must be connected to the action . this takes place via the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so it is even those who are or confirm with OK to complete .
supp@@ ose you want some usual &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; functions for tool bar add or it should adjust this for better overview by some Tr@@ en@@ ner in several groups . open the tool@@ bars setup dialog for Settings tool bar . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tr@@ en@@ ner ( completely left ) for my tool bar . after the selection of the element , which is added to the tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar .
I want to preview for example a fast way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tr@@ en@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone , who does not know my tool bar may believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by sampling all symbols to make sure everything work .
secure in the correct folder . after new XML date does not exist , but your tool bar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder . please adjust your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the correct folder . please adjust your tool bar ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate folder .
perhaps the notable extension of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ ating language that you like . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document system for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; Rep@@ os@@ itory if som@@ eb@@ ody has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ating / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we will deal with the second install@@ ment here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c &#93; = path , relative to this file , e.g. php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these docum@@ entations , e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation section 1 = = 1.@@ html Vali@@ d = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html day 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , see in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation here :
# K@@ DE config File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 , = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Initi@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = introduction , ... Basic syntax = tr@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic syn@@ taxes ...
note the # vor Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . that shows that it is a folder in tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess conditions ( except through the Re@@ ason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself .
note that the directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent on the upper end of the Bau@@ man@@ hood &amp; m@@ d@@ ash file ; folder is displayed ! ) .
no space influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; and lt . signs . these should be by &amp; amp ; and lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative and quantitative ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ r@@ ots are replaced .
the summar@@ ised section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which serves to be displayed in the context of a text string and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Cont@@ ext list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connections .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / doc / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then you create a folder ( such as do@@ cr@@ c ) and copy your HTML documentation here .
if you are sure that these good and there are sure to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but they are proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to distribute the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else . at different places , there is an email with email to send the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded to our main archive from where all the other &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; -@@ users can be checked and only done when our team needs them as correct and used for the release . to use a useful contribution , for what it is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key , that is the source of resources provided for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading are required for their private G@@ PG key , or in the case you can have several key , you can choose one out . in the new resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can be empty ) and with click OK the up@@ loading process can be started .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded to the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , tool bar tool up@@ loading , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before the installation , &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource is war@@ ned by testing and the Sig@@ ni@@ fication . in case of problems , it may be canc@@ eled . if the integrity of the resource is given carefully and the resource will be correctly signed , appears with the specification of the owner of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which currently does not work by &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; the creation can be used tim@@ eless because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag@@ onal format . there is the sim@@ pler way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . choose the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with D@@ TD description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target name : newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p file .
DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE file parts : the string that will be released ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tag such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / / / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ T@@ EP after conversion : when activated , produces &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; according to transformation the &amp; ter@@ at@@ r@@ c ; editor , using the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; Ren@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefit from &amp; quantitative us ; this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; quantitative us ; little value to produce .
in &amp; m@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this differentiation affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars over actions , everything is marked as global , to secure the group of administ@@ rators different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements provide a personal collection of web design for a single user . these are custom samples and tool@@ bars . local elements are saved in user directory so that only this user can use personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply , this is most restricted size . all elements are stored in folder of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; MDI ; consists of some main areas : the editorial window , the installation views , the boxes with information and the tool bar . please beat in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the ant@@ en@@ ary with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document button , like close the current , other or of the cartridge , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click on the editorial department leading to another context menu concerning the revised document menu ( cut / copy / insert ) , editing the mouse under the mouse poin@@ ter or Open the file , if the character string is referred to a file below the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editors there is the tool@@ bars of the Ed@@ itors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional works as standard to which a set of tool@@ bars are displayed . in the course of further expansion by &amp; quantitative representation , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert it into your document , then click the icon to insert the day . now you should insert the data for this straight enter ( like anchor ) , you can fill out different fields in one dialog .
the installation views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate to the information of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; to navigate them to open and strip . in the display with cart@@ ei@@ re@@ it@@ ers stand for files , project , templates , docum@@ enting , docum@@ enting , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative information ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or delete the files from the storage medium may be done with the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; Boo@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided in three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; global templates are always available , local templates for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more on templates is found in .
here you can find information about the available scripts themselves . the concept of sub@@ structures in Global , Lok@@ al and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , you can start the script to edit or send by email .
with this view it shows the internal structure of the active document . by links to a element , the cur@@ sor is placed on the position of the element . by the right click of an element , a list of commands can be found in terms of navigation and retri@@ eve of the tree .
this tree appears among other building views . with it , man@@ ure attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change the change of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development . you can download it documentation for &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create your documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add @-@ specific documentation , edit and look .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes in the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this ant@@ it@@ re@@ iter shows information on each in Qu@@ anta progress script . so , for example , the used D@@ TD uses the current document and all changes to D@@ TD is shown .
this ant@@ it@@ re@@ iter shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts , which are done , give all error messages ( such as those are ) in this window .
the &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bar are extensive , and easy to understand . show on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate bars is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
another feature of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e@@ Mail . &amp; Boo@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if they receive a tool bar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure this in &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; like any other backup and download !
it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; therefore , auto@@ conf might pass a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , specify . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed .
if you have trouble at starting &amp; quantitative time ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folders . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative l@@ us ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE surface . &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; it has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during work , the best &amp; HTML editor ; editor to create , began the developers of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; an independent , exten@@ dable brand @-@ up languages would be ? well , this would make it an absolutely great Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; now , far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . combined , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quantitative ; for that it should be suitable &amp; IDE ; for that it should be suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above mentioned claim , that &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; the idea of why some of them has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ or is not only that possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; as much as they need it for their need .
&amp; quantitative l@@ us ; allows web to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . thanks to the program comp@@ resses you can realize &amp; quantitative information . ( more about it you will find in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed Version and produced a commercial program .
more details about the detailed documentation is associated with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently developing and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ ti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . look into the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , just an error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ codes , allowing them correctly and do not be understood from the browser as form@@ att@@ ing order .
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ note that the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and space character in &amp; URL ; s . in first line to include &amp; URL ; s into the anch@@ ors day .
switches the log selection and off . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; select button selection .
directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
search a character string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or SE@@ D with GUI and pre@@ defined expres@@ sions to help you .
shows the message window or not . that &apos;s the window where you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger .
the problem and en@@ rol@@ ment of the problem repor@@ ters at the lower border of the &amp; quantitative movement . the problem repor@@ ter is activated , as soon as you go to the structure .
displays the symbol turn left from the main window . this column allows you to set the book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if the book@@ marks in the current file , they will be appearing in the menu with entries pre @-@ previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file names of the other documents .
opens a exist@@ ent project from the hard disk . &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searched the project directory for new files that might be there . this enables to copy the graphic files into your project folder or a sub folder and add it to the project .
load the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapters &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; projects you will find details of details .
invites a project @-@ tool bar . these will be kept in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the names . promotions must be saved using Settings ... . tool bar will be saved via tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
if you don &apos;t have a tool bar from the visible area . if you don &apos;t have the tool bar yet , you are asked if you want to do that .
with that , you can send their own tool bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; quantitative mode ; ) so that the tool bar will be available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool bar as app@@ endix .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where every other can be accessed . see in .
load an &amp; D@@ TD ; you , or anything else has made and convert into the &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; own label format .
re@@ loading / c@@ iting the re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful when re@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; to renew the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , fail@@ ing the load .
this menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar .
allows access to the current tag dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ating or disabled the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . smart , means that &amp; quantitative l@@ us may refuse to insert the obj@@ ector by means of a tool bar , if this day contra@@ dic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the above menu points . click on it . click on a activated plug de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ taxes @-@ setting mode for the current file . the list of available highlighted schem@@ es depends on the@@ ories ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document , using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the remote application T@@ id@@ y .
immediate change@@ over between the different types of interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the change@@ over can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the default card mode , which is also the default option , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quantitative representation ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains one entry for every open window . with choice of entries , the corresponding window will be activated .
to@@ g@@ gles the display of status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; quantitative ; main window to or out .
the changes in this dialog will affect each application which use the K@@ HTML Part including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browsers .
jud@@ get@@ h the behaviour of the editorial @-@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; there is details of details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which will follow and follow the sequences .
this should generate a assistance in the field of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantitative l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with each open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quantitative representation ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , for example after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be terminated with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example , fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quantitative representation ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pre@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the machine address of the machine , which you want to access such data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you can be empty this field , the default settings of the chosen protocol is used . depending on the remote control of the remote host it might be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files can be used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great when you have a static content you want to download and change . if you need to download and change . if you need to download this script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) , one must be different .
an@@ ew , when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated . if a project started to re@@ boot from scratch .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to goo@@ d@@ will .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the shell , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be Up@@ load in the menu with project features in the menu window in the window frame or with the scanning range Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in project assist@@ ants and are described in . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which can be re @-@ read about project folders such as project folders .
additional options on top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ age are excluded from the project .
the proj@@ ections that will be loaded when opening the project . can be read more about project views .
thus the desired deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed is found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set using the button Options . in this case , the trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting can be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a building short@@ list for each profile , showing a custom building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be edited , edited or deleted as well as a ma@@ iling list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can switch event actions and delete these actions , change or delete . event actions are executed if an previously certain event happens , such as the back@@ ing of a file . see details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project which was opened . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced by this behavior .
to open a different project , Open Project ... open from the Menu Project or the Open Project . the Open Project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; Boo@@ ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; there is enabled files . same thing happens when you load a new project .
project manager gives access to the files in the project . there can be the files in the current project .
the folder is just as well , however the entries can be opened and opening with the right mouse button on the right @-@ right button context menu :
several profiles can be chosen here . the profile contains information on the site of the up@@ loaded files . see .
enables removing of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button will be bl@@ ends to remove the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and you can forget it . this option is useful if common up@@ loading files is needed and save the rather un@@ safe Password on the disk -@@ option is not possible .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you upload your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; you can create many high @-@ speed profiles and thus loaded the project ( or parts of the project ) on different servers . in the editing or creation of a profile , this dialogue is displayed :
this is the name of the server that should be copied to files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . usually must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your Ang@@ li@@ vel@@ vet , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discre@@ tion . the password will be stored on the plate , so that it can not be read , but each with programming knowledge it can be easily seen in the plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool bar . there may be many views in one project , i.e. , by simply changing the view , various files and tool bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the Menu Project or the Project tool bar , accessible via Settings tool bar tool bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of &amp; quantitative l@@ us ; to the own working methods .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best on the menu tool@@ bars are st@@ ew@@ ed . use and adding different tool bar will be handled by adding tool bar at the bottom section of the tool@@ bars .
the tool bar and the symbols can be adjusted either by the context menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which the new tool@@ bar can be specified , tool bar edit or tool bar can be executed in the dialog where the actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to a single tool bar ( icon ) on a tool bar , the entries will be ready to remove and promotion indicated that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set the settings ..
templates are basically identical docum@@ ent@@ aries , code schn@@ itz@@ el and files for the link . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the existing directory with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the existing directory in the pre@@ dispos@@ ition . templates have in &amp; quantitative representation ; in about the restrictions you need to set out for the file system .
some and quantitative templates ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions requested prior to usage .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary files are normally inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the storage space under global templates . further information on templates are available in .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates . see here for more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is to be inserted again in documents up to a complete menu control system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are in pre @-@ storage space under global templates . see here for more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates serve all sites as templates . you are a collection of various documents , which can be organized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; aer@@ ap@@ l@@ us here .
create a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As template as local template ....
as soon as this happened , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the submission of project conditions .
in your document , select text in your document and click on file as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be pulled out with drag and put on the man@@ tle templates .
the creation of bin@@ ocular templates is simple : copy the file only into a template folder . you can use all file management functions such as drag and shut@@ down or insert into the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the Project files Bau@@ man@@ tra click on a folder right click on the right and secure a name for the template and secure . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or a global template .
project templates enable a very goal oriented prec@@ urs@@ or . you can create head@@ lines and tap@@ as or dynam@@ ically using &amp; PHP ; create , add files or linked to them . in addition , some things can keep using templates very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the under@@ window templates are based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / templates / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates , each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to define the behavior of a folder in the introductory overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in context menu Properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection field containing the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low @-@ hidden , as soon as the At@@ ter@@ ous attri@@ bute is inher@@ ited .
this is enabled by default and fits all besides the regular folders . if a standard folder would be dis@@ able , except they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , it would seem to appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you can probably see in a trunk folder .
allows four or listed text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for any specific project and allows copying files to a folder with special head@@ lines / floor lines a complete presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / floor lines .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates of one place to another .
&amp; Mon@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; the code editor that are accessible via the menu . the first mode will replace the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : it invites you to see a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cur@@ sor . then you can edit and when needed to save the source code editor , in which the changes carried out in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor , which contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ cryp@@ t &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit these directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , there is no plans to change this behaviour .
the second mode is just like the first , except , that at the same time , the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , this mode is activated , when pressing the button on the active cur@@ sor of a window to the others , the position will be kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is selectable via Settings Qu@@ anta ; view can be set between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computers and a large span for slow calcul@@ ator .
supp@@ ose you want to change the title of the web page , it is possible to choose the title characteristics as soon as a new document is created with V@@ PL ; editor , as soon as a new document is created with V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to change the suspension process . this means that you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow for storage of information about the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list enables the change of the in@@ hal@@ ed , e.g. key words in column name and key@@ word keywords on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete . a change about the list is possible exactly as in met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert a external CSS style presentation by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is as usual in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare conditions the cur@@ sor still beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by plug@@ ging or deleted by button or distance .
the insertion of tags will be made in the same way via the tool bar , as in the source text editor . it &apos;s too note that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags will not be removed , for example , if an anchor is inserted , every other ambient is needed to be removed .
some tool@@ bars , such as the tables or lists of tools are disabled . you will later operate in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to work tables or lists of tools in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles is the search for certain elements possible and the execution of the styles can be tr@@ acked .

there are many graphical tools regarding the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly , why I have written .
the mer@@ ging was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and changes on many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in bringing together .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the entry had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; differences in line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful features were added later .
for example , if you want to compare quickly the text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece Ko@@ de . the file extension refers to the differences of conflicts . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . the screenshot shows three source files when merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you do with the same and complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this screen saver features :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and di@@ lig@@ ently the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have enabled Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if rows are only visible in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at a summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble more if som@@ eb@@ ody changes the withdrawal . )
when a file is equal , and the others distingu@@ ishes itself in one line , then the colour indicates that file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can make sure that the ti@@ pping work will make you complete the file names of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 file folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
open dialog allows manual setting of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last updated file from the list box . when opening a button , you will need to specify a third file ; if you do not leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
about the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be selected , however , if a file is selected , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names from A in the two other folders .
when merge is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to establish an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when we do it .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can define options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you would like to compare all the file , but only parts of one text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag files from cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparative window . compared with open dialog you will need to select any files , you can simply connect the dialog with the button button .
you can also use drag and pick @-@ up : simply drag a file from one file manager or selected text from an editor and leave it over a comparison window .
which is thought about that ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how much these functions would be , you would need to compare two corresponding files , they would need to compare it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare the relevant sections , simply add and then compare .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; diff@@ 3 ; extract . only the cl@@ auses of text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ ting the pulling and insertion of text into another program as cut and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and insertion ) . in such cases , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each window window , the info line shows the character A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) Every Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path is too long for a while , then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three spring windows are numbered A , B and C . A has the colour blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed over the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one considers the colour that file is different . if both files distingu@@ ish , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s right in the next section ( merge ) .
left next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . if white characters are not so important , it is useful only to see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only in strings and comments , for the processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted by the digits , where the respective source file is activated . if the default file is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an Info @-@ line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ aring &#93; when you have handled the result . usually , it contains a text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved , saving de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use buttons to the next conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two different windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed , where the first group is not visible . ) This group is then highlighted the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left there is a black bar .
sometimes , due to the automatic composite or manual processing , no further line remains in the group ; then there is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again a different source code . this text appears not in the final stored file , even in a mark that you may have to copy and elsewhere .
the text can copy , but it appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such a text from the stereotype window . go carefully with this function .
note : if when selecting the sources you ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or reviews are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly to the image sequence and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you like in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys on the left , side , end , C@@ tr@@ l at the beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end . you can also use it from other programs in addition to the vertical frame bar can also be used for navigation use .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using inser@@ ting button , you can change between the plug @-@ in and transfer mode . ( default is the insertion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the compilation columns will synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section ) and the ed@@ itable output window appears ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ ward / C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict still considered the conflict . therefore , the conflict has to be distinguished between sol@@ uble and uns@@ ol@@ ved conflicts .
in order to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to automatically copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insertion ) . if this option is enabled , then you will check it automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . be careful with this option , because you could easily over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ants are stored according to the under@@ lying operating system . UNIX versions use a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ tex @-@ sign \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the def@@ ending of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and re@@ produced during the next start . ( menu Ins@@ ert - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a script with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog box illustrates the scriptures with variable width , you should not use it . )
if you dis@@ able this option , differences in short text are displayed . if the chosen scripture doesn &apos;t support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be displayed . on these systems the default settings automatically introduces an un@@ just colour .
when this option is enabled , the tab character will be inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
if you push the input or return , the input on the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy falls into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can choose which line @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all of all identical lines are igno@@ red in the source files . the second step is igno@@ red each line . in this step , the second step is not igno@@ red each line . in this step , white characters will not be igno@@ red .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car @-@ back sign &apos; \ &apos; . usually igno@@ red &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car back@@ log , but then could be displayed differently with different sizes in the side @-@ on page . however , if this option is enabled , this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) igno@@ red . in the result the differences are still indicated but they are treated like white characters .
in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as indicated in white symbols .
intensi@@ vely after even smaller differences , the option is activated in default . it is effectively with complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically non @-@ ski@@ p mode , this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection will be shown before the opening of the conflict .
automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by choosing the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if the white characters are less important in many files . note that the automatic selection also provides conflicts to numbers or comments when options are igno@@ red or ignor@@ ing C / C + + -@@ comments .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan and execute a merge . look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version will be missing the suff@@ ix . if already a such backup file with the suff@@ ix . original exists , it will be deleted without any further f@@ use .
fits the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and rest@@ art . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set to the control centre globally . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , all entries will be used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding , a short notice that the local coding is . ( this can &apos;t be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this does not affect how special characters is treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
if you have mach@@ ined a file , you can determine which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processor error , you might not function with your codec . ( e.g. , your files may be encoded 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can define the coding of output folders .
turn this off to supp@@ ress the high@@ s of changes in white characters in the text or su@@ tions . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when options ignore or Ig@@ no@@ ff C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . however , you might be able to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B &amp; lt . -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal standard column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available place on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window by side or over@@ another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files . the current file will also work together . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as the default file called for the output file . ( if this function is used to run the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your demands . you can use this function e.g. for out distur@@ bing parts or to correct the reset .
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command is used ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when appropriate . each input line has to have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is that the user will need more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , most users want to program an external program , and most users would like to program that . the good news is that in most cases SE@@ D or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for lines to convert the input into upper@@ case . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \ \ 1 found the found text in the first cl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ couple . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to be used by automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . the \ \ _ BAR _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you try to experiment with SE@@ D , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may see that regular expres@@ sions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the igno@@ red numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line @-@ off . SE@@ D &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character is replaced by nothing , i.e. virtually deleted .
sometimes you would like to do more information on one time . then you can use Sem@@ icon@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the goals of each other . example :
instead of SE@@ D you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ e -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ es are needed with per@@ l some details . where SE@@ D \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor will maintain and maintain . additional operations change only the data that provides line @-@ down @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the processor se@@ ar pre@@ processor uses the output of the standard Pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences in the worst case .
often , programmer have to edit many files in a folder . this is why you can compare and merge the complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal to assemble a proposal ; you can adjust the suggest@@ ion before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ate and show the simul@@ ated changes without being able to perform ,
... leads selected actions either by all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or just with the selected objects ( F6 @-@ key ) ,
this is very similar to the same and compilation of individual files . you just need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders will be merged , folder 1 will be used as the basis . if no target folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders starts , not the merge . to start the compilation , you must select the corresponding menu entry , or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow )
while reading the folder you describe a small message window about the current progress . if you retri@@ eve the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that time .
if the scanning of the file is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and any folder that has been found during scanning , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder structure is normally folded . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folders or fold .
if you click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the type file is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . if the mer@@ ging action is not installed automatically , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , in columns A / B / C , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
file are considered identical when you are all content identical . then , folder will have the same color . at folders the age is quite considerable for its colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such in@@ correct objects can exist , this can &apos;t be launched .
... A and B not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contra@@ dic@@ tory file types . as long as such in@@ correct objects could exist , this can &apos;t be launched .
the mode to synchron@@ ize mode is active when only two folders and no exp@@ iring target folder were specified , and if the directories are synchron@@ ize synchron@@ ize . then choose &amp; Play diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical to that both folders are identical .
... A and B exist , but not identical . the user can lead and save the result in both folders . ( the user watches as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the merge , copied &amp; Play diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the newer file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ certain ) , then the date of files and performs the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . sol@@ der such errors do not be solved , the mer@@ ging of the folders can not be started .
while the merger is executed one file after the other hand . status column shows far at the end when the mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other information when doing something unexpected . if the merger is completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right .
if setup dialog box is selected for general analysis , K@@ NO@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ for@@ ter , dissolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ ving conflicts will only be shown if three folders are compared or assembled . )
you can either perform the right entry ( file or od@@ or ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all assemblies ( also in all subjects ) , you can start bringing together .
please note : if you have no target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode C , B will be selected as the target and to synchron@@ ize A and / or B as the destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries should be indicated in the target folder . there are some options to be transferred in folder . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select a directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut action ) to run the current element or press F6 .
if by contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still inv@@ alid inter@@ sections , a message appears on faul@@ ty elements , you can choose to select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options leading to em@@ ulate and break .
select Sim@@ ating if you want to see what would happen without the really changes . you will then get a detailed list of all the actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen photo ) .
if you are ready to use a file , then choose folders / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you don &apos;t have saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then you will lead &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a bug , message and detailed status information . at the end the list see some error messages that can help you choose to select the cause of the problem . if you have the option to select or to solve the problem of any other way , before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries are individually switched , re@@ members &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this entries in the current session ) and leads them occasionally again . even if you do this merge , these entries will be taken into account . only if you change the mer@@ ging promotion , these entries will be re @-@ assembled .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that fit onto the pattern are displayed in the Elem@@ entary tree . can be used several samples . separate plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is not to match this pattern .
files and folders that conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be used more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
igno@@ red files that are also igno@@ red by CV@@ S are igno@@ red by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specifically adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( see at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signal . )
in some file systems files have a try @-@ attributes . in other file systems a leading point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
with links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic link will be compared if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
with links to folders : if the option is switched off , the links are treated like normal file and recur@@ sively perme@@ ate . ( note that link to a folder ) will lead and recur@@ sively . ( note that this option might result in a final pass and make @-@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched off .
a complete analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistics @-@ columns . ( the number of tex@@ tured , ung@@ ster , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower , if they are based on files that contain any text . ( enter the corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare great folders over a slow network , you may get faster , only the date of change and the file size . however , this option is necessary to use a certain degree of security . please use this option in default .
similar to the date of changing . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they have lost equal . for example , if copying the amendment item is lost . please use this option in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions are called to be identical . also the results of the compilation of files are saved in both folders . this option is switched off in the default settings .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because the other file does not have changed , you should check this in any case . ) This option is default in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another folder , then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ ine . if a old backup file with the .@@ original expansion is already existing , this will also be the default of single files , not only the merge of single files . this option is switched on in default .
normally the folders pane remains visible in the mer@@ ging of single files ; you can switch the window divider with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the directory and window windows to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare an file simply by double @-@ click . nevertheless , you can merge a single file directly without the folder . once you can save the result , the status will be done and the file will not be re@@ activated if you start the file .
however , this status comes , however , if you read the directory again : directory menu : new reading
K@@ DE supports network transparent with help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open the files on local or remote computers .
the first command line is compar@@ es a local file containing a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . some Things You should note :
a path can be relatively small or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely right .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space character &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes using the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol . it follows a short list of constra@@ ints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then you will always have a file as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change@@ ability date . therefore , the calculation or change@@ ability date from the original . ( note the option to the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently available as the Differ@@ ences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences in connection . to play K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences of viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3 Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; 2 complete input files , if it is applied to a patch file in the unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; Play diff@@ 3 ; patch program starts to recover the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this is not working if not the original files does not have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the mer@@ ging or the same of folders will not support in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compression ) is already available . Moreover , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can be mer@@ ging such as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I use GPL programs for very long and have much lear@@ nt in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go to it so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( such as k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated differently , but if only one non @-@ white characters is different , the line is not identical as it &apos;s not identical . if the Lines is the next to Each other , this is encoded as this is the case .
the editor is indicated for every difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . this important information is simply lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that might save this information .
the effort has been so far too big . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly turned ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be removed . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used as many colors for remarkable differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting reports from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 functions ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information about how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes will be found in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ you gives the folder to your system in which K@@ DE installed . if you are uns@@ af@@ e , find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker used , you should have trouble shooting problems . nevertheless , please refer to the &amp; k@@ de ; ma@@ iling lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or switching ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or revers@@ al insertion ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only differences are : files that are identical in all folders , and therefore do not appear in folder .
( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder with updated updates to this options . )
there will be only entries indicated that identical files will be copied to the target folder . if the target folder doesn &apos;t contain these files , they are missing after the compilation . ( the behavior is likely to be modified in a later program version . ) This option is default in default .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar , if you are attached to one of the buttons at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , if the rows are already available , they will be removed during clicking on the button .
in the default , this option is disabled . basic differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to change their current programs on the working areas , to end their size or move it . this works both within a desktop and in several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications which can be selected and even move on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on it , if the right mouse button is clicked on if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has been clicked on the application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . if , however , the context menu and the name of application , as well as entries , to maxim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize the requirements and entries . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window onto the full size of mind . only when on a application was clicked on .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only if on a application was clicked on .
the check box is marked , windows within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ surfaces .
if this field is crossed , will be displayed in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual working surfaces are displayed .
selecting this field allows you to display &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . view the numbers of virtual working surfaces . it &apos;s together with name , then the names will be ordained , and eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as a background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty space surfaces will be displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple right corner with the propor@@ tions of program windows . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in some other windows ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , what is very good for the display on the front of the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ ature in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in the size to display windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs out of the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent retri@@ ev@@ ing switches ... will appear the dialog for Settings .
currently , it can not be changed in the dialog for Settings . but you can finish it manually :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen magni@@ fying . you can use &amp; k@@ mag . you can read a magni@@ fying text for sounds or accurate viewing of a photos . this includes artists , web designers and people with a vision . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly improved to improve new functions . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
if you see &amp; k@@ likes ; start a window as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged range of the screen . in the following , this window will be displayed as a magni@@ fication window .. The image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is a enlarged range of screen and is lab@@ eled in the following as a selection dialog .
in the default setting it can be enlarged &amp; k@@ mag . alternatively , you can see &amp; k@@ mag . additionally , you can illustr@@ ate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection process ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection process mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouth buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse over the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you add additionally the &amp; Shift ; button or press &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection dialog .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection dialog . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
start or stops the update of the display . the stop of the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the ref@@ res@@ h rate ( very low , straight , medium , high ) . the higher the ref@@ res@@ h rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area will appear in a window .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click when the mouse poin@@ ter a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain @-@ chosen syndrome ) and which every mouse click painful pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , once the mouse poin@@ ter a while at the same point . it is intended to help people who em@@ ulate the chosen key pain ( RS@@ I ) Syndrome and those who em@@ ulate every mouse click p@@ ains . also , it does require a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; may circum@@ vent pain , which is created when clicking on the mouse , and helps you to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer pain , which use your computer when using your computer , if this is not yet done .
in order to clear it even more : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should avoid pain , which arise when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the user because of all ergonomic aid supplies : the result can be explo@@ red for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and leads a mouse click when you break the movement shortly .
if the smart move is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break , after pressing the mouse button . now move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion . the smart move requires a little exercise but you get used to get it quickly .
the residence time must be enough after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool should cover a mouse click .
if the case is turned on , the script is enabled ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be waiting , before using the mouse button , if the mouse button will leave you again , if the mouse has temporarily stopped .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now it is enabled by clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . such movements will be stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ straw k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , however , they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can reduce &amp; k@@ de ; along with it , the reaction time can be shortened . open to sound &amp; multimedia , select the sound system . there &apos;s a shooting sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start by &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other windows environments , please find the respective documentation to find out how to get there a program automatically .
sets all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog box . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to access to the last pressing of application .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially using the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shi@@ fting should be switched off . if you have used the automatic mouse click , you can later push the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; if you need to decrease .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in browser window , which does not pose a link . you can therefore use the mouse to such places , until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is t@@ ruck@@ ed , you should clean your mouse . that is normally pretty easy . the trick is not easy to clean the mouse , but also the rolls that come in contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as it happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear if you see the bottom of the mouse .
when you have removed the ball , you would need to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
in very rare situations , the operating system crash@@ es the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started shi@@ fting the smart move , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean ; the operation can &apos;t leave the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a window manager under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists to run even a mouse click . this will be returned by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor on another place .
work@@ around : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor position where you want him . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of mind when you don &apos;t feel any key mouse clicks . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and the cover parts of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I do not create it to edit the text .
the smart move is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board or move it to any other action when you want to move the mouse with a pressing mouse button . but it will probably need to get some problems here . here are some advice about it :
use the smart move not if you just didn &apos;t start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just hit a mouse click here . at the end of the text area , press the mouse button pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and again conver@@ ti@@ fully the mouse button .
you can use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this allows you to play back when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart move also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it needs some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test expansion for &amp; X Window ; installed , that should be the case on most system already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and a speaker and this is setup correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; operated the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter . this program was developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I Syndrome and who prepar@@ es the prayer of the mouse keys pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling @-@ up process before the mouse button is released . in this way , the pulling side can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows users to talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; the user can let users speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk sets which should be spoken again .
on the first side of the assistant ( lin@@ king screenshot ) you specify the command that will be used later for voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second side you can choose the standard text @-@ fit book . you can often choose the text @-@ pass@@ words used without them . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary of the Wor@@ ter@@ ine . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can copy the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , that only properly j@@ ump@@ ed words into the word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially an input field for the scanning license of your propositions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a course memory of the already spoken propositions ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the propositions which you want to hear . every proposition is attached to the boot memory . you can choose the phr@@ ases that are to be spoken again .
using the menu entry for Settings ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog box contains two boards , language output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ nal , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card statement , refer to the command to enter the speech of speech . in the selection field , the character encoding is fixed , using the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two species , to pass the text . select the check box if the text is unchanged as standard entry to the language generator .
if the check box is not chosen , the text is used as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command to write voice from your language generator is based . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples are found in the attachment .
as a language service you can use &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings are available on this site and is currently useful to use a standardized interface for voice output and the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after the selection of a text passage , determine which promotion is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text address , or in the case for Text@@ pass@@ ag@@ enb@@ ücher .
with the selection of So@@ ck@@ fort , the chosen text passage will be inserted directly and in addition to the inserted memory , the chosen text passage will initially be entered at first in the input field .
with the second selection field closing of the processing window for the processing window , you can define whether the text @-@ fit book on the closure of the processing window will be saved automatically .
with the selection of text box book store the book is stored . if you choose to throw changes , the text @-@ password are not stored . select where saved , will find &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the word @-@ matching book is to be stored .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word . in the main window shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a Dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used Dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ nal .
with the buttons right on the side you can delete words or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , or export the order of books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words are simply compare by copy of the assignment . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org Dictionary to include only correct written words into the new dictionary .
this option lets you merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries will be merged and how they are to be found .
with this option you can create a new , empty Dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create an dictionary with your voc@@ abul@@ ary during the time of time .
the main section of the window to the processing of text branches is divided in two . in the upper part , the text sheets are presented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit an selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage , or the corresponding key short@@ cut . if you have selected a text for the text , you can change only its name .
actions such as new Text passages or books will add or select selected passages and books either by selecting the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text @-@ pass@@ ers or passages can be changed by pulling in the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , otherwise the selected zones will be used .
the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , otherwise the selected zones will be used .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field it is used , otherwise the selected sentences in the running memory is used .
this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is placed directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the smart left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another passage .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow clear@@ est in the lower part of the main window with Hin@@ point in the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar will be bl@@ ended .
in this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar is displayed by entries directly under the tool bar . by clicking on the smart left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another passage automatically .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output not properly or not completely entered . open Settings ... , open the side General Settings and enter the command for voice synthesis on a box voice card . ( see article dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers for further details )
Festival is a language version of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are currently supported . the license allows you to use festival free of charge and without restrictions .
in order to indicate an example of the command line for setting up voice output , it is believed to be the festival in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival . the command to write voice is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an optional language generator . currently , he only supports the English translation . currently , it allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and further restrictions on any limitations .
in order to show an example of the command line for setup of language output , it is believed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ eware . language output is then possible with one of the three command samples possible :
for the third example , the option must include data as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it turns a list of phon@@ em@@ bles into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ man@@ ure the text in phon@@ eme . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / FIB@@ US / local / mb@@ rol@@ a .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ ah will glad@@ ly swal@@ lowed the text of text , so that an additional sign must be added . the complete command is therefore more hon@@ our@@ able than in the other examples :
( CAT ) ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / us@@ r / local / f@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / us@@ r / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / de@@ 1 / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ is@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option can be inserted as default default .
the voice output dem@@ on &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide language support , which provides a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed by SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice systems .
since the setting up of the voice stand@@ ings only occurs in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , available in the installation dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can use a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual from your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that people cannot speak , but can &apos;t speak text by the machine . there is a list already spoken sentences that can leave the user again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is an existing module of existing service that allows every application to read text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer is ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities , and users can also offer interesting options .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; , even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded .
the voice output is performed via the program file disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
production of language editions on the command line ( or with Shell @-@ scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; support program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .

an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ops on the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the text of a web site or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read all or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / or e @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need to install program and disp@@ at@@ cher and properly set correctly . see also
during the first start of kt@@ ops or while still no spokes@@ man are set . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the map material will be displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those who distingu@@ ish themselves in volume or speed . you can also use several variants for a syn@@ thesizer ; you should use at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; as the program speed disper@@ ser is used otherwise the standard device .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with many printers for the same printer .
if you click on the map of the cards , the speaker map shows the speaker . this will then automatically start when you launch a kt@@ m@@ ist and yet no spokes@@ man is set .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when there is no speaker .
in a click , select a speaker from the list , and click the button to remove the spokes@@ man from the list .
in a click , select a speaker from the list , and click on the button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click a speaker out of the list , and click on the button to push the speaker on the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list is also its priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
here you choose a mood type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a young and female voice .
if you click here , the new spokes@@ man will appear on the map card speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click on Edit menu .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the chart map and check if the T@@ TS @-@ service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; see . now , click on the map card to create and manage text applications . see .
if you have set at least one speaker , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; please click on the map cards General in order to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options .
check out this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can read text applications and read menus . see . remove the selection , K@@ TT@@ SD is activated and the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when the ts@@ ky is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; on , if the field does not activate the field output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , dis@@ appears immediately once the preview is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start text applications , stop , stop and return .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board read or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a mission .
click on the or OK , then all modified settings are taken on all sides .
the card card is only indicated when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the cards in the General tab in General and then activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed site . check out the text that will be read , and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the voice output should begin .
it is almost always sense to mark the desired text of a web site . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; performance lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read displayed message text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs , and select the text that will be read , and choose the language menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; in other applications are embedded as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ noti@@ fy is the t@@ elecommunications system of &amp; k@@ de ; which allows you to notify you of informed events . you can read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts ; read here .
in &amp; conversation ; the I@@ RC program from &amp; k@@ de ; you can arrange various types of messages . for example , you can be informed that if in a I@@ RC channel you can find a message to read in your nick@@ name . you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
support &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ noti@@ fy , appears to be an menu entry in the menu settings of this program . the possible default settings for K@@ noti@@ fy differ depending on application .
filter to render a good way to correct &amp; kt@@ ops ; is a good example . the file k@@ m@@ .x@@ ml , which comes to delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b out of the news that can be sent out , and in addition to the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as an assum@@ ption .
filter are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filter is not required .
in fil@@ tering text it is edited , before it is sent to the program file disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving tongue or ab@@ brevi@@ ations to select a matching language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices .
in order to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; land disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be withdrawn from all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen Reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is getting too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after issu@@ ing the warning .
News have the next priority priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of application that you can read messages . while you welcome you can ride a long text on a website , you can ride to the space . &amp; k@@ de ; Al@@ erts are also news . read the news .
the rest are simple text applications . each order you can attach from the card card is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that use text applications . text applications are intended for the issue longer texts that have no special impact .
all four order types are processed in maintenance @-@ long , except the output of screen re@@ aders . when an application sends out the output of a screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a reading , this issue will stop and termin@@ ate this issue .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ inst@@ ances . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text@@ books as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter processing the text and give it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filter are designed as modules . in the future there can be further kinds of filters .
substitute parts of a text string that can replace parts of a text by other text . it can be shipped either as words or as regular expres@@ sions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is possible with pre@@ defined character strings as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of supply and kt@@ ops ; are included some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaking selection filters , you can depend on the contents of text or depending on the program , sent to a speaker . if you have set a female voice , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . read about it about it .
each of these different filter has set the rules , according to which he is applied for a speech output . if the filter makes it not applicable , he will continue the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification ; it is sent by all activated filters , which were set up on the side down below . the processing of the filters in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of pitches of normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be automatically re@@ activated from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup dialog .
in order to set up a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as a comparative pattern , these patterns will be exchanged in the text , then the text is replaced with the associated replacement text . large and sm@@ iling is considered to be considered .
enter your name for your filter . if you can choose any name , it is necessary to distingu@@ ish only from the names of the other filter .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces him in accordance with the drawing string from the column . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to shift the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file that store the current list or delete . download a list from a file that is attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages when you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed .
if a value is registered here , the filter is only applied if the text is done by one of the specified uses . you can separate multiple programs separately through Kom@@ mat@@ a . for example : Con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail
the application ID @-@ running programs are available with the q@@ d@@ bus range ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers are required . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 is displayed , you may only enter a copy .
the string filter is only applied to the text if any conditions associated with one entry in the box of the filter if necessary . are all input fields empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison with words used by the drawing paper filter regular expres@@ sions in the form \ \ &apos;s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) .
in this manual you can find no instructions for writing from regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; exit &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be illustrated in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former propri@@ etary &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files in a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such conversion . however , the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed on your system .
specify the path to the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter you can send texts to a particular speaker that is set up on the map card speaker , or to a speaker with specific properties . you can define that texts by mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a speaker to the filters there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics that selected the program , and the characteristics of the speaker postcard speaker is selected . with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
here is a value registered , if the text contains the default regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can call this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start off the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
check here the characteristics of the desired microphone station . if the text meets the above mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected to display the desired requirements at the eh@@ est . click on the right button to display the dialogue selection .
use this buttons to save or upload your subscri@@ ber settings or to delete all settings .
the Inter@@ phone selection filter will only be applied to the text if any conditions with an entry in the box of the filter apply if applicable . you must have at least one required condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programm@@ ers to give their applications T@@ TS skills . uses to communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface to the language output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / r@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice alarm services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the program on the property K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text to read and option a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands :
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start off in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ revers@@ ing filters , but when using module for Festival you do not read websites .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that if you do not use this voice to read these websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be installed and can be found on the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or inter@@ actions seem to cause defects in syn@@ thes@@ izers , so whole propositions is over@@ lap , or only Kau@@ der@@ y@@ ch will be issued . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option is set to the correct value for the respective language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a character string . see .

the program &quot; Great @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ izers . if you would like to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ izers , use the developer team in conjunction with the developer .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter uses , but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the pack@@ ets and the development files for the &quot; Great Place &quot; program . &quot;
if you purchase the source code by &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can refer to the code folder for k@@ de@@ bit or download every night currently created Tar@@ ball , and install the program with following commands :
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if you &apos;re correctly working with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the sh@@ ell@@ scription SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is intended to be further developed so that the setting of all @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is divided into individual propositions . the user can lead , repeat or retri@@ eve the issue , to stop the issue .
if you request an application of text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can request the characteristics of the preferred microphone for the output . if you choose a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will automatically select the best speaker . if you choose to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker is selected , see you in .
if you click on the cart@@ ing card speaker to add or click on the list , the cartridge Card speakers is displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is displayed . details of the modules can be found in the following .
enter the path to the exe festival program . if the path is included to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you will need to enter a festival only .
select the encoding for text written by the festival . if you are aware that Western languages can use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slides , adjust volume , frequency speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few regulator and cannot be displayed this gray , the chosen voice can &apos;t be chosen those settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices will need to be charged several seconds due to their size . if you want to mark this check box , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first pack will be syn@@ thes@@ ised .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have no spokes@@ man set up ( or forget to click on the user ) . see .
if this check box is marked , the program window is visible on the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the launch , just the symbol of the system is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ m@@ gr is still not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD appears to read a text . therefore , you have the possibility to stop it or otherwise .
here are all orders placed in the maintenance @-@ long list , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the straight sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID is the speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can choose a lot in the order that is selected in the list below , or back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other cards ) is adopted and the ts@@ mouth is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window again .
if the sound system &apos;s sound system is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map card audio . see also .
here only text@@ books are listed and manages . issues of screen Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; see in .
select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or kt@@ ops ; you can &apos;t load the required libraries .
if gr@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no starting modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . see also
set the microphone rate here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % roughly the double normal travel speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ X must be installed .
click on the user to accept the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PCM units and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
in this cardboard card you can setup special actions which will always be executed in the text by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language agreements :
the output of screen rec@@ tan@@ gles has the highest priority . it will be withdrawn from all other orders and holds these orders . after issu@@ ing the screen Reader has been read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the preceding of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message is subject to normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you can read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless I welcome you to enter the room straight .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the qu@@ eu@@ e long .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introductory sound are active as well , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message .
the settings on this map card only apply for normal text applications . for news , warning and issues of screen re@@ inst@@ ances there is no special actions when these are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages can be read , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the boxes for al@@ erts will appear .
select this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fication . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and dict@@ ated ; reads no al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , al@@ erts , where a sound is played , will not be read by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use this buttons to add events or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in a I@@ RC message your nick@@ name .
all the events which in the list is nothing else , will be igno@@ red by &amp; kt@@ ts ; igno@@ red .
in this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops should do when an event is going to do . you have the following selection possibilities :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired microphone . standard select the speaker , which is shown in the list on the map as well as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if there are three levels defined for events . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of certain application . otherwise , the action is defined for carrying out the promotion , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list ) : for this , you can define the pre @-@ read al@@ erts such as follows :
use the button to store the settings for the al@@ erts in a file . use the button loading to start saved settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except all Noti@@ fication are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to highlight text for a voice output . this standard contains stamps for the control of voices , voice speed , voice and voice . furthermore , stamps for the control of the identification of e.g. ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only available in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default , the festival is used in the release of SS@@ ML .
if the default settings for speed or pitch will not be set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ality filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this means that the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also ski@@ p the entire text order , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer is not directly supported .
for the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it will automatically be set up automatically as a set of pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter . you can add or further set limit filters , but the start is not rounded .
in the easiest way to check out the device selection by pressing . switch off the speaker selection and specify the text to read . switch off the speaker selection again , change some characteristics and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . in addition , you need to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the preliminary start can begin , since only the first set should be processed and not the whole text block what can last long ,
you can then stop text applications on the card card or termin@@ ate when the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit filter will automatically set up if you can start the ts@@ p for the first time . it cannot be removed only . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do .
the sub@@ lim@@ line filter allows the text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tobacco sign ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set bound@@ aries ( automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard set of pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter maintains the value of the set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ eg@@ . ) , warning , messages or the output of screen re@@ ars .
if you have removed the normal set of set filters , you can insert this again by removing the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c ; it contained file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the card interface board selection you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speakers ( the top of the card card speaker ) . in other words , no microphone characteristics are specified .
use of the matching speaker that has all the characteristics of a set of speakers . if you cho@@ oses or edit the speaker &apos;s settings . otherwise , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the nar@@ rator drawn up the originally set .
select the method for entering the desired microphone characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
please select the properties of the desired microphone . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
select this check box when the feature priority is to have other features . you can also set several markings on this site .
since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the issue , this property is rarely used as priority feature . if you possibly want to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you know that a specific application was sent in another language as the result of the working environment .
to use all the characteristics of the speaker , which corresponds to clear the following , please click on the selection button , and then apply nar@@ rator , which corresponds to the h@@ ott@@ est of the following .
in this case 0 means the last text order in the maintenance long . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get trac@@ e@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and the Arctic is finished . probably you have to record G@@ star@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved yet , you may have a not compatible version of G@@ star@@ amer . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I list@@ ened simultaneously with another application music . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message that says : the to open PCM .
on your system , the problem that conflicts may occur in AL@@ SA , which will prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .org .
I have an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival but the ts@@ ky doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add your new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ops / Vo@@ ices the new voice . when you &apos;re successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; when you have heard the voice , please refer to the developers .
on the map of the card audio there is an setting speed . this makes the program SO@@ X installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive offer a setup of speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the spe@@ ach speed are igno@@ red when using your HTML code . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .x@@ mg file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML transmission filter , and use the spe@@ ech@@ less .
I do not create that websites with a female voice can be read . I have set a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . this doesn &apos;t re@@ produce the X@@ SL file to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber , the gender tags . it also applies to VO@@ ICE tags for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added a custom @-@ string filter , and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more sat@@ in - or go back on the ant@@ ei@@ re@@ iter , the order of existing will only be out of a sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
point of inter@@ section ( point , mark , ex@@ clamation mark , com@@ m and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be fil@@ tering . use a filter for this sign instead of a set limit .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projected .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : make sure the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered by calling the G@@ ST register before using G@@ rec@@ amer ; ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music simultaneously and leave a text in addition , if you will start writing a text order and then rest@@ art another . possible solutions for this issue can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support a real break . if you keep a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops ; the current set will still be read .
the audio program SO@@ X is used for general setting of Inter@@ phone , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; when Tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ wrapped Archive ) downloaded , sign the Tar@@ ball into an appropriate folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 will be the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least on request .
the following modules for voice synthesis are made by default . some of them have a runtime of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of the Deb@@ ian Distribution option ) , configure the configure parameter setting , which causes the transfer of setting .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / op@@ t / k@@ de@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you have to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination .
on Deb@@ ian @-@ Systems , / us@@ r / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ bit echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; IN@@ ST @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ e@@ fil@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd t@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions you have received with syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the votes is generally well and there are multiple voices and languages . with many voices you can adjust volume , frequency speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . would you like to read websites you need to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German votes are subject to limitations at the passing .
this voice is called Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in a early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian votes , you need to enter the vote m@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) encoding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are available as first on your CDs &apos;s CDs .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code should be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , this option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ill@@ ary , as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; Syn@@ thesizer ; then the Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ al analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ Program and the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; - Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; a complete language output system is . &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generated from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this by &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create German text di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
in this case , additional W@@ rap@@ per @-@ code is added to the festival to use &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ voices to the voice synthesis ; notice that the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ file files are not installed , but in the folder / lib / . instructions you will find under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; then you load MS German Festival of
you will find instructions in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E package in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , you do not need to rev@@ ise the error correction ) . then add the following lines to the festival / lib / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm .

on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fest@@ ival@@ .@@ s@@ cm . replace only the lines for your installed German voices . replace the right path in / us@@ r / local / mb@@ rol@@ a / . at the time of compilation of this hand@@ book work the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 votes with I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to give the language about Festival with a Czech &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; vote and install at first festival and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; and make sure that both will work . then download Festival Czech by
un@@ pack the program with tar into a suitable folder and create an enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia . the exec@@ utable festival needs to be stored in your P@@ AT@@ H .
load the voting file c@@ z@@ 2 from the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ page and un@@ pack them with un@@ zip in the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ folder .

Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ed voice syn@@ thesizer , which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with still sufficient stimul@@ ant quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can do not adjust sound levels at this voice or noise level .
it is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are included as first on your distribution as first on your distribution .
H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice syn@@ thesizer which works with di@@ ph@@ onic . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o produces the sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can voice voice , pitch and lou@@ der via kt@@ ops .
load at least a German language file from the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ page and un@@ pack them with un@@ zip to the folder / us@@ r / local / mb@@ rol@@ a .
copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file .
select a voice and make a voice and set up the paths to &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
Epo@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ed voice syn@@ thesizer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with still sufficient stimul@@ ant quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can adjust the volume at this voice syn@@ thesizer .
then launch kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g . at the cart@@ ei@@ card speaker , click on adding . if the Epo@@ s programs are not included in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the cart@@ ei@@ board speaker . enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; ep@@ och@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain additional information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ed voice syn@@ thesizer , written in &amp; Java ; it is necessary to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can &apos;t adjust sound level , volume or frequency speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; the command line can be controlled .
best use a command that writes voice output to a temporary audio file ( wav ) , rather than to send the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ controller board , which enables the administration of network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ controller board ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ controller board can be accessed by selecting the menu of the menu .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same manner as other settings from the &amp; k@@ y@@ work@@ conf . create areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the user a simple surface for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network settings are displayed ; displayed . the module network settings ( net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting a cloud center ; internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it &apos;s important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t need to install . physical equipment and their driver must already be installed and configured to configure &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and enables adjusting the network characteristics .
in most cases device drivers and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network appliances added later , you need to load the driver by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the module network settings will be loaded when the network settings are installed in &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; index values is chosen . starting with the module network settings this , the used platform is automatically detected on the system automatically .
if the platform can not be detected , the specified selection is offered . it is the platform from the list , which the distribution and the release of the release can be met . due to the setup of non @-@ again requests can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically set automatically .
changing the network settings can only be displayed in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed only , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can proceed by clicking the button administration mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password mode .
in the system management system , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the Reiter network interfaces serves to manage the network appliances of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the rider network interfaces can be carried out :
the displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... in the dialog box setup .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button extension to the dialog with further out@@ going options .
with the selection , the TCP / IP settings are collected from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information on any system start , therefore no further adjustments are required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP servers can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field IP address . in the input field network mask is the sub@@ net@@ mask .
if this setting is un@@ checked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface of bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values shown in this dialog will be displayed as a characteristics of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP address . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network @-@ administrator should be asked .
depending on your needs , network equipment can be activated or switched off . un@@ locked network equipment is generated by selecting from the list and pressing interface ....
network appliances , depending on required requirements , can be disabled or disabled . turn off of an activated network device by selecting from the list and pressing interface .
the IP address of the computer is connected in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by standard TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway @-@ computer can be selected .
a calcul@@ ator with DNS support replaces a full domain address given by the respective IP address . that is necessary because computers only require IP addresses . if the machine ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ en@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name resolution enables easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a entries and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons .
by clicking the button ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the name of New Nam@@ es@@ erv@@ er .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit .... It will edit the dialog .
the list of known calcul@@ ator describes the host name server based on the TCP / IP system . it is used primarily by boats if no DNS server are available . in small , closed network drives it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list nam@@ eless calcul@@ ator contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will support . it is still in the test of IP to replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The new alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known hosts has several alias names , button Add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog for View@@ ing Computers will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then click the list of the static Host .
the settings calculated in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to enable the changes , the following command must be set .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf homepage ; ht@@ t@@ p : / / net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , you can download the latest version of the source text .
for the installation of bin@@ aries ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is just downloading the rpm package and it is easy to install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively a tool with graphical user interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de will not be sufficient ; but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this will only be experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , the second will be reviewed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files .
this area can not replace more information about IP networks . in this section , only basic information about the integration of the PC will be convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . IPv4 is not expected that it will continue in the near future . this description therefore focuses on the widespread IPv4 .
one of the most important information is to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign network drives , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator the response , which can be used as a valid IP address , if necessary , the IP address can not be chosen as desired !
when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from an especially suitable for this purpose . to avoid IP address , addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course you can access the Internet for such machines by adjusting a g@@ at@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 is usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually put on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines have the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP address .
the network address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . it is usually assigned to address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 of the called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as an attached circle .
in this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where it is stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file will sometimes be changed to DSL connections , so it cannot be surprised , if in case of active DSL connections , another content is to be found there .
for &amp; SuSE &apos;s ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config file . another status is expected to occur .

print the cr@@ ont@@ ab all users on the system . this option is only accessible for users to possess the extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SIX file format &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date .
&amp; dat ; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple files on a tape . the first target was to create a surface for tar , selective un@@ packing . the second purpose was the answer of a question that my wife said : how much longer does it take ?
before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; dat ; it can be done on three ways :
&amp; dat ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the promot@@ er in the band will not be asked if the band is being format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the promot@@ er , it looks for the matching index on your disk . can this be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created .
if everything goes well , the symbol is changed to the tape drive that the band has been mounted . in the Status Bar , a message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched out through the tape &apos;s entry for the band .
before checking the tape , first the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
and dat ; gives a change in the symbol to recognize that the binding for the band has been solved and indicates a corresponding message in the Status Bar . the band can now be cast without a danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat is used , it must be format@@ ted and format@@ ted .
a band@@ age must be format@@ ted before you need to be used to store data . this procedure does not need to be format@@ ted before use . if you need to format@@ ted a band before use , this process is usually done by the band of &amp; k@@ dat file . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually put a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape , D@@ AT drives on the other hand .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the band is lost , the band is automatically mounted and is ready to use .
before you get to the backup process , you need to select the required files . this can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is secured .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a bit . only the so selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the S@@ ick@@ le menu ...
once the backup has been launched , the dialog for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog box shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archive in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a ha@@ k . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archive and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure was started , the dialog for Settings . in this dialog you can check out your selection and change the application folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to demonstrate . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can restore the restore files , the files you need to be recovered . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that include the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files from one of the archives with one box . it will only be converted to the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders .
click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archive and select in the menu !
once the recovery process was started , the dialog for Rest@@ oration . in this dialog , you can check out your selection and change the folder for restoration .
when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears Re@@ construc@@ tor . this dialog shows the progress of recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes , it is necessary to re@@ generate the band @-@ inde@@ x@@ ing file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing In@@ dex@@ files for this volume . you can create the index to two types of the band :
this will create a safety profile with the straight marked files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a secure profile :
the current work@@ load in which the backup should be made . the list of secured files will be updated automatically according to the just selected application folder .
for all the files listed under backup files , that only the files are protected under the same file system , such as the folder . file , which can lie on other file systems , can be used separately under backup files . each entry is considered tar independent of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup file , a snap@@ shot file will be saved . only the files have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
to remove the snap@@ shot file before the call from tar . this causes that all files will be backed up and a new snap@@ shot will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons &amp; gt ; covered ; and lt ; files wasn &apos;t completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu of K@@ D@@ at menu in the menu settings .. make the following settings for the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must be transferred to the non @-@ re@@ winding type of the belt device .
is this setting , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape release , the command is loaded to the drive . for some disks , this is necessary before read@@ - or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the throwing at band@@ ing work is un@@ lock . it does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the band is switched on and automatically the bond is dis@@ closed . use this option does not use Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to be &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is format@@ ted and write a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file sets itself as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this character is host : seconds , with the host name of the system is format@@ ted on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the ep@@ och in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is using a file named HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file , using the same name in the folder .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not the incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a securing tape . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ log log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewing for system log file . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , or where system allows you to obtain information about your system or where system allows the various protocols ; experienced users can access the fast access to the example on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ellers log ; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background . the program is capable of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can find information about your system or where the system changes the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ log log ; experienced users can provide for fast access to information on problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ellers log ; tries some expanded functionality , which can be filtered and analysed directly with the help of the protocol .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ log log ; a number of useful functions . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following screen photo , you will cover &amp; ks@@ ga@@ log ; functions available , with which help to make the individual protocol lines of a protocol file and sort the individual options for sor@@ ting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start , &amp; ks@@ log log ; initially , you will not display the system log file ; you will not have a small message window , so you don &apos;t have a system administrator right . the protocol files can be found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar in order to filter the filter bar . in the default setting , the list of log file is displayed automatically , so that only log file is displayed next to the filter entry . then , a protocol line is only displayed if in one of the columns have the filter search term contained .
you can also choose another entry , of course , also choose another entry . the strings of the filter search term will then choose the column he@@ ap process . in addition , in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so you will show you &amp; ks@@ log log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you recognize the major protocol lines . protocol lines of stage error are displayed with a remarkable color as protocol lines of stage Note . the display of protocol @-@ lines can be shut down .
if you would like to display certain process ( for example in the system log or in cr@@ on Protocol ) , so you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column . this case may be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you will use the filter bar .
in addition , you can jump to the new lines of the main window in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ log log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub@@ window and to manage . once you have chosen a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ellers log ; has a dedicated website to ht@@ t@@ p : / / ks@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ sof@@ tw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the source of &amp; ks@@ log log ;
&amp; ks@@ ellers log ; also find the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ log log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well @-@ known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; this section takes some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ;
the System V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control program starts at high driving of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible is the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to go on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ ite binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe som@@ eb@@ ody could try to make a machine on system V In@@ it , without a new installation and new format . therefore , you must be sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there , in case there was one there .
the SY@@ SV In@@ it differs from the BSD incre@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub @-@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. place , r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a complete script for every system service you want to start driving on a different run@@ level . system services contain such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services invol@@ ve not such things such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should normally be on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something to do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program , and starts the first that he finds .
the standard run@@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ cle@@ ave run@@ way 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can try / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand , then you can get a bit through , then you will enter it by rest@@ art the system and run the following :
but how does it begin to enter the right scripts ? if you want to enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : every scripts is written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would read the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the names , and when a K contains , the script will stop with the argument . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the argument .
some people require a simple way to create machines for many purposes . I might have &amp; eg ; a server -@@ Run@@ level have , that can run only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; also I could have a user @-@ track , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say tri@@ vi@@ al : simply drag an entry out of the availability of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop to stop ) .
you can also shift the scripts from Run@@ es or change the position within a level , by clicking on it . thereby , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they draw out an entry out of the availability of your availability .
note : entries can be post@@ pon@@ ed when you move it into a new area . to choose them just to choose from the menu edit menu or from the context menu , and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ting number of a single entry can be sometimes not calculated . in such case you need to edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding memory before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there is no possibility to restore files that have been thrown in the tr@@ ash basket . be careful therefore .
you can use the tab button to activate the various work@@ areas ( available system services , round level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous day .
to move an entry into another round level , shift it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the type or name of a single entry manually , press the tab button to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by clicking the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to refuse the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c . otherwise it is available . otherwise they will be available by &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; otherwise they are recovered by &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local ks@@ ys@@ v@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ nings , and now the machine is constantly revised . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ m@@ pt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default round level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have a few system services with &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; available in run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the type of system services launched in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for propri@@ etary investment programs in this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately not yet the standard . the authors of &amp; ks@@ ys@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are located in the proper directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message if your config files are not available or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , can even be from version to version different . if you use a different distribution , please send me more about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ users ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ users ;
after you have made modifications , you have to save them . either use the respective icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the menu file .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two boards , user @-@ user and user group rank@@ ings . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user or group characteristics .
some cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings . only if you have placement limitations ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cart@@ ing card will be created , if shadow @-@ pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the map card password will be released , if shadow pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears , if necessary for at least one single file system limit ( Qu@@ ota ) activ@@ ates and initi@@ alized ( det@@ ectable in the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the limited data limitations in KB ) :
these parameters can be set individually for any file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field of fil@@ esystem with plac@@ limitation .
the card group informs about the group &apos;s height of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , will be in the Pri@@ m@@ eric group . furthermore , the user can select in other groups by selecting this in large field .
the Group &apos;s dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , choose from the menu user or group or click the matching button button of the tool bar . the editing or delete of the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , change , and more .
