<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can specify if enough space is available to display whether or whether the surface of the subordinate right is to appear. in addition, the relative position of labeling can be specified in the rectangle below.</seg>
<seg id="19">In representation algorithms for Treembodies, the rule is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & fsview, this goal is not always available. note that less space for the frame is lost, if the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a distribution of the surface of a single entry is done for the suborderly entries, the implementation will remain appropriate for the label and to avoid space losses incurred by frame. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive second release.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly via your storage location. if you were able to organize enough photos, then you will use sub-folders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant supply of pictures at different themes and a great number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will not be re-organizing your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier. split new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies the backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to store the metadata in & fixtures; this ensures that exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database by selecting the corresponding item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what will change? you can make a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now you start the real work as you need to show any photo words, label and rating. of course you can select all the pictures you need the same attribute. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos when working on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now proceed with keywords, keywords, how you continue in other programs frequently called or proceed categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import the katalogized images from another source with embedded sample, then drag the pictures to the correct place. the umsorting of Hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by removing a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are taken by & screwed; updated while the sub-trees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata are overcut. this is a very gross representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the words - the next section refers to label or comments, the third important tool to cataloging your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to see most of your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from afar off is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this of the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy, 60 years after landing. Wow! one starts to dream, reminders, the historical period of time, you may even hear the silence. the label has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other photos look at the title perhaps more important than the picture itself is maybe more important than the picture itself. if you show pictures you should tell a story about it, To help Him about the motif that you move on the motif that you can understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is okay when a picture is not perfect when the strength is only able to work alone with a label.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can also use a lot of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8). then you can even export your images into web galleries. then you will see this label according to your wishes into the label and / or the title of web sites. you must tell the story here for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train leaves the spatial presentation now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for geolocalizing are already innable and are still innable in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can also open your travels across pictures with geographical data. this also shows the photos at the recording location. you can also export the pictures at Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with Google Earth view.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a vocalist with copyright and designated the practice of using the copyrights to remove limitations on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also in all amended versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description says that information contained in the setup site of & fixtures; when information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (Synonym for Creators and Writer): this field should add your name, or the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. if this value has been stored once, it should not be changed once. this field does not support the semicolons as a separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortan (Synonym for Writz): linked with the author. this field contains the name of the photographer. examples such as: employee photographer, Free photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memorandum of authority, this field has to be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for providers): do not use the bidder field to identify the photo. this must not necessarily be the author. if the photographer wants to be listed here. if the picture is a stock photo, then the picture will find the image here, then the picture is indicated here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this is no protection against misuse. anyone who have a little more than basic knowledge in work with calculator may delete or change it. the solution for this problem is only of low interest. for professionals and neck professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is uniquely unique. & digiplug comes in the near future, a module for stacking processing is available in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, plate failure, ECC, transmission error, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs of those who lost on the road or a fire. those kind of losses are the same that you can also pass on traditional paper shots or negatives. in this section it is possible to solve problems in the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the biggest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics that has a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs and you may not need them live longer than a few years. of course you can get more CDs and DVDs in archive quality. of course you can claim your life of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe that, in your exploration hall.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you are good discs and good recording devices. the best DVD slip devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you are much more reliable. it's therefore to choose the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if you have just written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protection it is by chemical antiaging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called Iso Buster's apparent wonders of CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but there's similar applications the damaged data from damaged floppy disks, hard disks, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything is said to be used for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn the data to high quality media at a non-quality media in a non-proprietary format. do not hesitate to copy the data to the next generation of media. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before editing the latest hardware / software.</seg>
<seg id="186">Dissolution manufacturers keep your statistics for itself. your manufacturers guarantee include a new disk, but not the data. Google will provide a large field study on error mechanion of hard drives: dismischief</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: discount on the longest when you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In lower temperature applications, the most likely cause of error occurred. some of SMART can be reported due to the impending failure. these are in particular reading and publishing meter. the expected lifetime of life ranges between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only a complete losses due to overvoltage. of course you can also create data loss due to a current if you have secured the files, but these losses can usually produce problems without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of power, that can take heavy damage when devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause these anomalies, complete data loss, hardware-aging, devastated motherboards and other defects. protect themselves before the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against power peaks is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that part of the energy-saving heat is absorbed and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a socket bar. but remember that not any connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that he protects the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also consider that it protects your protection against flash and thereby protects the correctly connected equipment.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of any cable can be used on your computer, you should also consider that all the peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage cables that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable entry and the TV map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. so it is ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">During an overvoltage protection your system protects your system from smaller variations in the power lines it will not really help you. even a fall of a few seconds can result to the loss of irrelevant data. it can therefore be meaningfully in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overlashings, these devices can automatically shut down battery energy when power failure. this gives you the possibility to save your data, and you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security with electricity trouble with the costs to avoid these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you are thinking about doing so. at the end you should remember all cables and drive back to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the correct configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any quantities of your data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are in comparison to the hard drives at home but very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data about comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images. it is not a poor solution, but there is no general securing solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services to have photos in full resolution. the professional variant offers you more available, in case of Flickr dramatically. for $25 a year you will receive unlimited memory, which should be reviewed in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors will be automatically included thanks to the TCP protocol and are included in the offer of a backup and a partial storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrate the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transmissions are due to transmission errors. the file system will be added to the data integrity between the operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred. all these problems remain undiscovered until you have no protection for this. no one seems to have thought that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought that the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much more secure data away than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission loss because they generate interferences within the data streams. if normal file systems remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected especially of transmissions, you should see in the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems will seem to be one of two candidates, which can handle on low level and is highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows available soon. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched a dedicated initiative with its btrm file system. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that uses the tender and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">These two factors are not responsible! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% at work bench systems. if notebooks, the share of thieves is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of the most. it is currently limited to a lower loss, e.g. theft or reinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; there has been no longer been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable for data loss when proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the proliferation file systems. please find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of temporary interruptions during an operation is higher and an undefined status will be avoided. if a file not completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threats for digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture adjustments of fundamental physical limits. is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and smoker characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far removed from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today cameras are very deteriorated in the direction of the 10 megapixels. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end results are the ideal for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so you're doing so other for data loss. 6% of all computers are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you do something like the new installation of your operating system, replacing boards or a size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you take your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then, one day, a flash, you are lucky when the drive wasn't connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot. don't forget pilot accident: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disintegration is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot of without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation-proof: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete moment up to two timesents: the complete backup and the final differential limit.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can produce the original status in any time. this backup means a versioning system on the next with the exception that is only abgeted and not continued.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily setup onto your machines. in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only changed the difference of files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase safety over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have saved on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach can be found enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time, you come back for backup. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for each month and a moment of notice for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have done a complete check.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., usage of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures can survive the next 40 year, that is about the period in which you really interested in you because they are reminded of your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you need to consider and evaluate everything today. unfortunately, there is no other way to leave with caution. all 5-8 years should consult you like the current system backward. however, less varieties are used in the past, so light is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available today for any time. if you have an old system it is important that you need to read your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. continue with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional print to change the system in its size. this means, in fact, enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have to have the scalability with the bearing and the area you want to enlarge it on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and put it to a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command, whether your new record has been recognized from the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Disk; dd if = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & dollar; partial resize / dev / sdc1 0 & LT; size of the plate in MBis; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollar; residency / dev / sc1 # change the size of rice FS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standard have the big advantage of an open specification. even if a day no software is available, you can create these yourself. this task is easier by the year too much.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that comes slowly from the market. you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard which should replace GIF. however, it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can use gamma- and chromatifying data for improved color order, but not as many as TIFF, and we would like to recommend you to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be saved in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm. a problem is however that this format has been adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital negatives file format is a license-free and open-open format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer makes it now available, and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon also sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe creates its XML-based XMP technology. XMP is for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is allowed with enlargement & quot; .xmpc; the file information is stored in XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original size of your recording, mostly in the shell format. however, it can cause problems in the linking between the metadatendatei and the image file, and as at the top time, it should be superior to use whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, supporting a large area of application areas and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarified efforts to reach metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Importing images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera channels, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a hostile processing you can use external programs. if you come back with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the machined images for the copyright with a digital watermark. then export them in Webgaleries, encode them in MPEG, use contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug. in the section adding a photos to an album, you can add a description as you can already click on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera and digiplug, use this using the computer, switching the camera switches to display mode and switch them. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you launch the camera interface, it tries to take a while with your camera. if the connection is made, a distance indication of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras are not available. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file support for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you can download the photos on your computer, you might possibly need the camera information on each entry. with the side bars and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of one single or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and the photo information displayed internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras not available all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer remarks, GPS etc. these information are the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & fixtures; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer, is the click on the button to download and then download all photos from their camera to a single album in & fixtures;. when downloading the photos were not deleted and we would be sure to delete the images into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the selected using standard selection methods by & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button to download and then select Selected. button selection Selected long as long as you have chosen some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a option is now available. these pictures have not been downloaded from & digiplug. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in front window. if you select this option, the new pictures will be downloaded from this option.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the knobs all download or download selected, a dialog with which you can select the target album. the list of existing albums you can read in section My albums. choose the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After completing the target album, press OK, and digiplug comes; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you downloaded the desired photos you can delete them from the camera, you can delete all at once you want to delete the button. if you want to delete all this, you must select this first and want to delete all selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to restore the photos which you will be deleted from the camera. you should not verify whether the photos are successfully deleted from the camera; you should be sure to delete them from the camera, if you want to complete the camera counter, this is much faster than the camera counter, since it is considerably faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not especially meaningful names. the filenames are often utilized after the photos of the camera were loaded, so it can be useful, the date and time when the image has been made, incorporate the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and for file-based corruption. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during the transfer opens three further options to be carried out before the photos on the disk will be stored. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXIF file will be copied to the IPTC file. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use a different file format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% m-% d% H:% M. if you place the date & time. for further customization you should read the help of the command-time.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file names, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase. or in uppercase you prefer to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, digiplug, digiplug, is shown below the name, the camera is displayed in the preview of the camera. your settings for renaming process will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">The digiplug has come; can perform all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic turn during shutdown. not all the cameras are ready to perform this information. in the Section sidebar Metadata you can find further details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is normally switched on, and when your camera does not provide this information, the photo in the original oriententation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the bottom area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera offers information about the date, which photo was made available, you can use & digiplug. all pictures with the same date are loaded in the same sub-album. not all the cameras are available in the same sub-album. not all the cameras are available in the section sidebar Meta Data, which might be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case stores and digiplug, the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, use the button extension and select the window based lower level at the lower end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is downloading here. select the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that you want to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the Standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, digiplug & digiplug comes; you can choose where the images are loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. click here the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this is a position that is indicated in longitude and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to connect an image with a precise geographic place. not everyone uses a plane to cartographed an area by automatic intake of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten then, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a postcard to another & digiplug, that can send a postcard to another & digiplug. if you want to locate the location of the photos, it is easy to document the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how the GPS data are supported in the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields such as the direction, traction and card conferences. the question is actually more, such as the data in those fields, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical mapping (manual) and lastly via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS device. but there are a few that are working with GPS receivers. either as map module or transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, as this is the only format that is supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, extract and correlate the data of pictures and from GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and latitude or other data, you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the pre-mentioned coordinates using e.g. maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">Digiplug & fixtures; tries to give you much control over his work processes. there are many settings to connect the behaviour of & digiplug; setting up to these settings, you need to set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select "" "select" "" "action can be displayed on embedded preview or image processing." "" "they are putting the standard behaviour of & fixtures; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view." ""</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standard didacity and copyright data. these data will automatically be selected in the respective IPTC data fields, if the option is written when you can download from camera line. this data will also be written in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the professional recording of the photographer. this field should be as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a closer description to the author, this field must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author if it's been shown here for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency would be the image available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions put the data into the respective IPTC wheel. this metadata must be permanently stored in the image and are not only available in the database of & fixtures; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into & fixtures; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image certificates as embedded application (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, with the images included in images. caution: with pictures that already contain labelling, these are overwritten by the digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer is in the main window over a file. according to the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug comes; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to fixed, which file types & digiplug has been tried; remove any file extensions to this list and remove any file in one & digiplug; Albumfolders, which does not have any of these extensions; ignored by & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset back by pressing the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the optic nerve & digiplug can be set on this page. however, some pictures have changed different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have different sizes and the synchronous mode, you should only use for fast computers. if you have one, then you can get a better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, picture processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can choose this here. you can use the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overclock and exposed parts of a picture can be marked with darker or bright color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing this section can be switched on with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling, the images are encoded with Chroma Subsampling, that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance. please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting up PNG compressing, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease the image quality, since PNG need more time to extract and unpacking. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF (TIFF) you can compress the deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality because the deflate algorithm does not work any loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the set of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can lossless save. even if you have written the loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. when this paragraph was not yet supported, metadata was not yet supported yet, however, was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & fixtures, the picture processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very quick to change the manipulation of your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default timeout is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, you create this option with a minimum loss of details. this option shows the image with a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white is used to use the camera. otherwise, when set, the automatic paint balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white is not set down. default, it's a fixed dbalance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors has the effect that the image has been selected in four steps, more details will be ignored for different cameras. this option will be ignored for different cameras.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-fit, so the parts of your images are burned, due to the inability of your camera, as penetrating white in the settings. the adjustment colours produces some unusual findings, as they can reconstruct the hairpin in various roses. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the sincere.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general can not be so fast enough as green and red. and dcraw are therefore trying to reconstruct the lack of green and red shares from the yet not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question, how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise, and can therefore be adjusted individually for any picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set him somewhat higher than the default 1. but this may also be taken later in the image options of & digiplug; image processing can be made too small to keep the time for the demo version, you should be conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particles that have many cameras and one matrix colour pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or Farmers structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">Digiplug & fixtures are used; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests, it was produced by DNG interpolation (variable number of gradient. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colouring of your lentils, you can put the red and blue correction data here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as you will be carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as these are to be given. there are also LCMS and digiplug; information like the color information of a colour space in the other are so that the colors are as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour matters if a picture in the image processing is opened / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders Soccupy the folder where e.g. / usr / share / color / user / user / user / user / .color / ICC, where you came back all your profile and digiplug; this folder is examined during the start of the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to depose. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour administrative view is an alternative to Xcalib or argl. here, only your images are not managed by the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model you are fit. not all profiles are contained in the same type. currently, PHost are currently corrected dcrab Gamma not for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you need to perform the htonmapping ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the soft-Proof-profile, which you can emulate how your printer can print a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors so very saturated. this could manually correct, instead of the blindalgorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obviously what color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not for the models of Canon. therefore, a table of cameras and profiles can fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style of the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that can be used by a series of & kde; imagery and image processing can support; many modules are written to work together with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. choose which you will use and these modules are loaded and loaded. these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond. also, you can see some of them in the context menu of the front.</seg>
<seg id="323">Spontaneous commit for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) on KIPI modules can be found via http: / / www.kipi-plugg.org or in the handbooks of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the transitions, usually are 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes turn off the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom end of the screen during display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics indicate a list of all supported cameras on the left side. if you want to use this camera, make sure that the camera is connected properly, switched on and in picture display mode. among them are the port settings. currently, the port settings are standard, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and Firewire cameras (IEEE-1394 or i-Link). this field is only active when you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera. you have to enter the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / ps, specify when you insert your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To connect your digital camera and digiplug, you need to connect the camera to your computer, put it in display mode and switch in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if you come and digiplug, the camera will automatically detects the camera. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be shown in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can include all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option dialog for moving &gt; images in the trashcan display, you can adjust the conversation of & fixtures; when deleting an photos in an album. in the sections of deletion of photos and deletion of an album, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right sidebar can be shut down through & screwed; if you use the option to use changes in the right sidebar without any query. otherwise, you have to save the changes with button modifications.</seg>
<seg id="333">You may also sign the screen of CD & fixtures; starting with the starting point. this will accelerate the start-up of & fixtures.</seg>
<seg id="334">The adjustment Beim start according to new photos are forced to search for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digiplug. if something out of the base folder was deleted, you ask whether it is to delete these from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various paint schemas can be used in & fixtures; used to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be set in Settings design from the tool bar. a preview of available designs will be displayed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & fixtures; you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">And digiplug comes; contains a fast picture processing with some base tools. you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improvement. image processing can be taken with a click with the left mouse button to preview a picture or through the context menu of preview and selection of details / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & fixtures; so you are not part of your distribution. further information about the KIPI modules are available in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">Status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current date number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge and including the tool bar for fast access to most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The processing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, not the functions will be used to save the original photo or the button Save from the tool bar. note that you can't recover the original photo, once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should be a copy of your image before you change it. this allows you to save with file save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image automatically by using the menu button to restore the image processing, then you lose any change that you have conducted at the photo since the last deposit.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly any promotion of the image processing can be made or recovered or recovered. the last action can be converted back or reproduced by processing and restore editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the key shortcut, Ctrl; -z to the reverse and make Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z for reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; through the return version or re-produce button in the tool bar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the promotions are also restored in between also reversed.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation cards in the toolbar, image high, image below or the entries in the menu file, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can find in the photo and out, in which you will find Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the menu menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnification factor automatic</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode. usually, you will use the Esc button. usually, you can't change this toolbar. if you don't want this, you can call it out of the digiplug-panel dialog. see this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the menu image and get the default & kde; printing dialog. you can adjust the settings here before using your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or entire phrases. all image preview can be selected from your choice. you must select only the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Exporting pressure assistance. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug comes; main window has a side strip on the right edge, which is important to provide important information and actions for the selected images. the same page strip is, also available in the image processing, even if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same rider allows the side bar to disappear or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can specify labelling with unlimited size or insert. note the text is UTF-8 compatible. meaning that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTCs fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are formed. if you want to use the IPTC market in other applications, please note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the button user or change to the next image, the labelling will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, this will always be done when you select a metadata setting, which is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section assessment is showing an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to rate multiple images at the same time, choose these from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating will be written into the IPTC field. coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box for the words of the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with the previously used in this & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief to the input of sample in a picture series. if you have entered different words, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed by selecting the appropriate fields in the tree. all the keywords of a picture are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures selected in the prime view and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, If you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, filming, keyword and search views. if in addition, one or more keyword filters will be used from the right hand, only the cut quantity of this two are available. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and off. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and create a dialog box, which you asks whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example shows the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keywords. the keyword is selected with Ctrl + a, and after it was filed a keyword from the right keyword to the selection and put it there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be placed.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off using Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and realized that it must have or be it, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that will be found in the database. this may be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a character string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an Extended search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to grouped options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then select the button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This product / tutorial has been written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I used it mainly at & digiplug; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why a colour-administered workflow is that the colours created by your camera or scanners, you can achieve that colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners are able to print or publish the colors on your monitor from your camera or scanners that are using your digital darkrooms.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on color management, then everyone wants to press the results which he would like to press. unfortunately this tutorial tells you to provide sufficient background information about color management. additionally, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informative decisions make you the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflows shall be met every six below, then you don't need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They are calibrated at a monitor that calibrated the sRGB colour space. (more information can be found at the bottom)</seg>
<seg id="381">Its only other picture spending is by e-mail or web, where sRGB of the de-facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if the RGB works well and makes life for all so easy, why should you use another color space and do so thoughts on colour digs to do?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limiting from sRGB compared to the colours that we really see can be seen below. it shows a 2-dimensional representative of all colors that we can see, the hufeisenine region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2 dimensional representative duties of sRGB using some larger colour spheres, you can also visit Bruce Lindblooms last page and then click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I get my monitor, if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB-color space or not, you don't need your monitor to sRGB at your RGB. if you are using the color space of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections to improve the image in most cases. use it therefore before you try further manual handling.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions standardization, derived, Automatic, and contrast, extend automatic correction from the menu, try automatically trying to make the best. they will try to experiment with these effects, to see which works best on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize this method: this method is scaled across the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its colour shaded. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">In the same method, this method adjusts the luminosity of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram's histogram function is as flat as possible. it is also only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle during a picture or it destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. determine the dark and bright trages and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast Full: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of RGB values of a picture through the postpone of the lowest and highest levels of all values in between. this is only visible at balanced pictures and may be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white print of & digiplug comes; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of one photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The White Storz Correction is something limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can do so far from the original image, if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, then your ways are needed to correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white recalabalgorithm of copyright by Pawel T. Jochrome. they restart it with the menu entry colours white, equal to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The front window can be adjusted in size. on the left side are the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically modified the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whitish, then click on the window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos features a red marker. the Luminance of the Pixels on this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top, a histogram is displayed very useful as soon as you have a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow can be adjusted to your photos or download even down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Reflecting with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use the colour temperature to be used for the calculation of color temperature. this type will also set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed subdivision increases the colors if more than a color channel of the Pixels are overexposed. you will be shown the combined result in white balance. this will be shown as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and load it exactly. any adjustment of the white load you can set this in a text file and load later again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings sets all filter values back on their standard values and the corresponding neutral white flashes back. note that neutral settings will be shown in other photo as your original. if you want to save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the machined image. 8-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this encoding is also required for high quality images. this encoding is also only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw pictures. it uses the change and instruction of color profiles. color mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the helmets. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter colour administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under the audio correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always do the same mistakes and you are always the same correction. in manual to the audio correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option of exposure to correct is the tool to gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug, tool color effects provides you four color-effects, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a Neon Effect and an edge filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, a effect of the image developed by the extra light. this had the effect that the brighter areas of darker and colours have been inverted. the result was a partial negatively of this picture. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar ization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image is chemically possible. a further increase is made revealing a negative image that's not to create photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and adapting the (2). applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and bright. try it simply, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for daylight converted colour film created by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly offers saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. however, the characteristics are also some photo graphs, especially those who are barely landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edge. the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. in large pictures, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color-color-effects of your photos with the tools in menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, you can use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the converted problem. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation decreases a good choice to increase the saturation. all the changes can be seen in the preview. if Him do the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple candy strength / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you will need the range of the slide for here. specifically the three shifts below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains an Graph of intensity values, an histogram, the active canals or the selected area. under the Graph are three shifts into the inside and to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright zones.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to study operation is to postpone the knob and to make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamically modified, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y-axis. in pictures, the large areas of a consistent color does not contain the linear distortions of a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones, and the lower tones for the middle tones, often gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colorimpettes can be used in the preview of the original image used to adjust the input values of the shade, middle and light tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the choice of manual values for each range. there are also two controls can be used in order to evaluate the output values like the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create an unspotted picture as a background while something different can be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically set the image values depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and load: using these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and later reloaded. to this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun sounds. enable the colour pipette to use and click the preview of the original images for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">This option controlled by overexposed pixels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of input values used on red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the correct picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated in dependence on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this Kästchen, there are two symbols between a linear and logarithmic view. for images with a consistent color, the linear mode has a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortwist to the right, i.e. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones of dark sayings are correspondent and the corresponding image pixels darker become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">In preview of the original photos, a red mark can be seen. if you want this marking on the area you want to change the original score. create a point on this line and move it up and down, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and load: using these buttons you can make exactly this. each curve creates you can be saved in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp Kurvenformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun sound. activate the dpette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">This option considers all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. here it is an indicator, that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun sounds was applied with the color pette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the correct (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel Mixer of & fixtures; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color shaded photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another highly advanced tool to mix the colors of the pictures. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixers of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can choose the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by adjusting the relative distribution and scales. the left pane of the window shows you a preview of The original can be viewed on your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red constraint. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram window appears to show you the corresponding colour value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right below: knob for red, green and construction allows you to add these channels. if you use Luminance, this is especially convenient when you can use the color mixer into the generation of amazing black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that occurs from colouring. although that is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colouring first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The save as and load buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any mixer adjustment can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">This option controlled by overexposed pixels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, that means you will get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. option Luminance is activated. the original image is under (1) and the painted image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinated because of your abstraction capacity. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. it looks good, among all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits toward the sky. i.e. similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves the landscapes, marine scenes and air photos. similarly, like the 002 Cokin (TM) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic overty effects and can simulate a lunar processes for day time. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotate filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow liner filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the shocks. this is very similar to the process of fletching and recovery in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and so similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Wearing the & digiplug, you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the Stich of an old master, a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry picture texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the certificate of depth or three-dimensional texture of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper Textureff is applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and the change below (2). the relief model relief is set at 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">The & digiplug comes; the frame can be added, a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer's eye to the limits of a photos is no easy task. a possibility to keep its attention is to be a decorative barrier. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. under image frame, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you want to adjust the desired frame type for your image. immediately embrace the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttonhole and decoratively add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame in percent. the value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture is larger than the original, but the original size is larger than the original but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have using the tool according to aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can add simple and formatted text in a picture at any point. this also goes on several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply specify the text and place it with your mouse. use text size, orientation, color from the color space and the character set. at the end you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-clear background. the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK. once the image has been stored once, the text is part of the picture. it can't be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug, tool stencil template, you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template in the image processing can be used to put templates on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you must add the PNG file format and should add to the maximum compression size. if you want to add your template's file size, then send an e-mail in English to the & digiplug; Mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool to the first time, you need to set your Templates folder with the button folder in the dialog. choose the folder in which you have copied templates. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the templates was placed, a building mantle appears to reflect the folder of a template's template. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can modify the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button resized the lower image. if you want to apply the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template onto the entire picture, you have to reduced the picture to the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the button under the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">Digiplug, three different tools are available. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very quick and easy, but produces particularly in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture. actually it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to get an atmospheric dunst, and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. these results in fact that sharp edges are made up to a common colour. the same phenomenon can be observed if colour points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras does normally need more sharpening than normal cameras for the privacy.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has been applied internal sharpening. images in the shell format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a shadow filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you will get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpen a photo with the Schärfen's bullets. you can correct with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should not work with this, since the results will not work very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but reinforced even the noise. in general, you can achieve further information about the menu entry. you will find further information and compare all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to make a bit soft, it is much easier than it to sharpened. use the tool for turnout with the menu entry and try something with settings. the front window on the right side of the dialog displays you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help the image to edit. the preview window displays the output of the film with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should try to be tried at first. if you increase the sharpness or increase the effect. if you produce the sharpness, smoke and get the impression of grass in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow greater radii. they should therefore get images of the best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is the percentage between the original and the twisted image that is added to the original. thereby the strength of sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a breach of the maximum RGB value and to the differential pressure amount. it is possible to define a minimum difference for an edge of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft change is exempted between the tones of the clay, and therefore beautifull error in faces, sky and surface areas are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unblurred filter. the original picture is the (1) and the revised picture the (2). unsharp masked is applied with a radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The fasteners & fixtures; Tool Refocus focused on an image through improving the sharpness. it used to protect the protected diversification filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get a picture to & quot; refocus on how to try to sharpen the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. usually, the traditional technique to sharpenance of pictures is the use of a sharpness mask. you can start it out of the menu by pressing colors Refoals in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauge's Fee. the Gauge's Fee has a very long tail, which results in a very long tail, which is far from the original quellpixel. the FIR ennese Viennese Inverse of Gauß is affected even very strongly in most cases, causing unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular edge sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results, if your image should be very unsharp, but then you should pay a bit.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation was reduced to the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Room filters: an increase in the room filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values are higher than 0,1 only. if the noise is too low, eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value is still smearing the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can create good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used exactly to this purpose. any refocus parameters will be stored for later and then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all trimming, color and intensity correction on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes that are not visible immediately, but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images and remove, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, it produces insharp masked and better results as sharpening. this could be caused by this, the unsharp maskbar uses a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to be blurred. even under optimal conditions it can never be able to remove the effect of dissharpness. for the Viennese filters you can show the result of the FIR Wiener Filters always at least as good as the impossible mask. the FIR Viennese Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small, focused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about methods to refer to methods in digital images, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob has the edge of the crosciary to create a more natural pupil in order to create an intact pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinent enables the customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The error correction is one of the most advanced tool, to remove no desired arte- with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The entry algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the Reiter smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed explanation: [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glassment on the image. a value of 0.9 should be found so that no sharpening is necessary. please note the detailed explanation of the directivity level should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you create a movie gravitality or CCD impulse becomes a high value of wishing samples. JPEG Artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor on alles. p then the relative smoothing. set this value as regards to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Rule tionality: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is needed, the more will be smoother, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm will pass through. usually this is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular range da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is being voted, then make sure that small angle should create a long term. so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the More to quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. but it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons Save as and load do exactly this. any setting of image error can be stored in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error correction is comparatively very fast in work. but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load after getting off. you can therefore break the calculation at any time using button demolition.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how to remove image error with small artifacts. the module is used on a picture that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefakt in the foreground that caused by a poor film location during the trip, The original image is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug, the noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image data. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove senses from camera or modem. effects of saved pictures from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor cams of digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen photo above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the underwindow advanced settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, of 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can be the image taken over the picture and the colour in it will be smoothed and therefore smaller flaws were adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the pixel pitch, which looks forward to adjust the filter distance. if it is increased, you can change the edges -filter if you can change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image data can no longer receive and smoking.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response of the filter can be removed. if it is too strong, you can remove the whole noise or catching peaks. if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Light intensity: controls the luminance lens of the image. we recommend either colour or light density to improve a picture. these settings don't influence the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings don't influence the smoothing process by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically stronger, but also contaminated the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phasenjittering damping. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of light density. if it is increased, the edges appear to occur. if it is on its minimum, robbed and phins can remove any noise and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters on the noise reduction which you have set, can be saved in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the fixed output was used with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to make the picture a bit soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to correct. use the tool for turnout with the menu entry and try to experiment with the box. the presentation of this operation shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug comes; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo-file data.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts, film screenings, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized pictures. the smoothing is done along the image contours and gives the content as it is the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text reasons. the algorithm to Restoration is carried out with a different tool, the error correction was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franks and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas it produces some compression & quot; artichoictequot; - small standards which are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons Save as well as loading are exactly this. any setup of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast in the work. however, it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load after getting off. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with button Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce like a photo with equal mode. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a Sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the notorious film screenings on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the correct counter (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, Textures was reduced to an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan arteas from the scannerical and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The fasteners & fixings; Tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixels of photos which have been removed with a CCD camera, eight uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are especially important for high quality raw mode photos, because many cameras with JPEG compression has a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; at a photo using a dark image subtracting method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the assistants with a button dark image. the tool will recognise automatic and bright pixels. they are highlighted in the preview window.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can record the dark image directly in the port to discover new name or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to correct image. a automatic processing of dark image will be found. note here that the assistent remembers the last dark image and will automatically reload this automatically at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture range and the preview can help you correct the result. the preview window displays the output of the film with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preview ranges.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the broken pixels at the preview and results of the film. choose the best Filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it is determined by an average of the islands. the resulting colour is assigned to all defectives in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all the pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel pitch will be moved to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel screen is moved to a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are withdrawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long layer of exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the revised picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Digiplug & fixtures; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. under exposed corners, a picture to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reach the edges and reduce the sensor. tele objective display may also show this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="568">But also has drawbacks. many center filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be possible, even with Center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise unsharpen effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure ranges of today's filming and color scanner and film-Scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centeraser using a raw image that is made without these filters. the tool Vignetting correction is applied to an image that is protected by John Walker. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulations, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and control the imaging of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of luminous intensity at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, or random an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or random to compensate a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukills, contrast and gamma-settings: the processing of a image with the Vignetting correction is reduced by the luminosity of the pixels. you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. regulators make you only positive values when you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a hostile reciration of the target image, then let the values for light intensity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug. image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction to a picture applied. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a pioneer of candy and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug comes; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses in photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. coloured distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second order covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grab has a similar effect set, flattened in the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient in the fourth floor corrects the distant corners to the second gradient. if you combine this two, any geometrical distortion can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion's second gradient. with negative values, tons-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values between distortion types.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value looks stronger than in the middle of the image. for most lentils, the 'Corner parameter is the reverse parameter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and therefore results in a correction first grades. negative values enlarge the positive image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightly: this value is adjusted in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values will increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog shows a preview of the distortions. the values you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or cohort-corrected correction should be carried out before all trimming or size changes. if you need to cut this correction and then perform a picture-shaped correction would be the effect of the folding.</seg>
<seg id="586">In order to help you make the best correction to help you display this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the sea level or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this spot. in the connection you can correct the tonnage / kissenic distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cold-like distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the mapping tool in menu transformations from the image processing or via the knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, you need to correction data-like correction. the next logical step for some designs, e.g. photos from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of using tons-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulate infra film on the Gennett-Gurabo website which is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra-film, see this URL. this film has a Sensitivtivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">On the left side of the window you can choose the area for the preview. if you move the red square with the mouse, you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters for film screenings and film sensitivity. the ISO regulator has changed the volume of grazing a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the predominance of colour Green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter channels are used to produce an infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos because the colour information would be missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra filter paper used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the revised picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug, filter film screenings is an easy-to-use tool for reproduce film screenshots like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known for the sensitivity of films to increase the manufacturer large silver grains of the photo oemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grab effect gives your photo a certain moods or appears to move back to the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy sight, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">Regulator can be calibrated the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the body. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film gradation effect based on a black / white picture. the original picture is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug, filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug, filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knob to influence this effect. the upper chooses the pin size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large pictures. smoothing controls the smoothing or, from the other side, the hinged.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the frame is marked with the (2) image size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug, filter drawing has used colour and intensity gradients in order to create a carboneskizze. the lines whose grains are slowly changed are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you would have chosen you would have chosen to catch you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob chooses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast (glassy).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon label filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved further through adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; Filter engraving the image in 3-D, as if it was stamped on wax. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digiplug comes; Filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color does not use the most important at content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to turn the image into a grey, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtration. a value of 30 corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engravings filter. the original (1) and the revised picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image in cells and look it like if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can stop this effects at any time with button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of visual acuity. it uses protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom lenses: twisted the picture along stone-shaped lines the way out from a center. this simulates a zooment camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial redness: twisted the picture by turning the pixel to a center. this simulates the infinness of a turned camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: pondering the image to create an unfocused camera lens. the object seems to resign back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement of motion: pondering the image through horizontal movements of pixel. this simulates the pness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographic, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softshell: pondering the picture soft in the dark and strong in the light tones. this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or to add a warm and subtiled bulb.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpensive sharpness: distorted the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the inseverity of a arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent impotent: finds the colour basins in the picture and cut them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divided the picture in rectangular cells and then created the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with button Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The regulators are a nice little tool to make rain ropes on your image. this makes it all of your paintings a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">The size of the image size allows to change the size of the image. since the dropping size is not automatically increasing with the size of the image. the quantity changes the number and density of drops. fish modified the optical effect of the drop to the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can start with the & digiplug; picture processing has a range of free of regulators. use the option to select the range, e.g. a face that will stay free to stay free. if you start the filter, the range will remain free of regaping.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning to the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transformations Turning or Transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrinking is simple. the big question is how you can get a picture sequence and the details are sharp? how can you find the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm is used here, making it a good work here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">When a photo of the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose the size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog box below is visible.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool size is used to change a linear Interpolation method to increase the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split scopes. uses a further developed approach. the based algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and see below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this option is enabled, the aspect ratio of the new size will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Rule tionality: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is needed, the more will be smoother, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and load are used exactly. any staging for photo enlarge can be saved as text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take much long and take a high CPU load after getting off. you can break the calculation at any time with button Finish button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles having been enlarged by a small color picture onto the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the result (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photos is not only a frequently used operation, but also a often underestimated tool to put a picture. the mouse simply need to cut a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you let down the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. thus you will get a good overview of your picture after cutting. you can create the size of the cut space by moving to the corners of the rectangle. create a new square by clicking on the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting edge, use the button button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or file Save as in the menu file to save the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool you can also specify the orientation as high format or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and the cross-size of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After side-ratios use a foam aspect ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you prefer to use Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to choose the selection automatically horizontal or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can set with the Max. ratio button for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation, setting.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After switching aspect allows its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Veral). if you are using the mapping tool, these settings are displayed as standard values in the EXIF file, so the EXIF data will be reflected in the image's image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The help of the compositions that help you to assemble your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of the similarity. such as the third-thirds, harmonic triangles have an opportunity to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that covers different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf sheets of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things we can feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the error number 1,618033988... and you already used to build your temple and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden proportions in all times when you create your images, buildings and even pictures to put your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is directed by the Fibonacci episode 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where any number after 1 is the sum of their two preceding numbers. the resulting partition is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. an composition which is this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center poses liquid aid lines if you are an image. these help numbers are drawn down below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you to your target good results for your photos. compared to third party, the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the image. this type of composition measures the sight of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule are the right corner of the golden spiral, also called golden spell. this right corner can be used to direct the golden spiral. this can be a line of its or different objects. this one can simply be just as being without the eye, it will accomplish its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also discussed by the above golden spiral. its vertex points are the middle points of the golden right corner. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, gold triangles have no equilateral triangles. diagonal to this lines can be issued a static object of dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to quicken your frame and create a effect of professional photo photographers dynamic symmetry. try your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontally mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious dividers.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the colour of the relief lines. if you have a painting with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisibly. in this way you can adjust the colour of the lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture taken in which the things are shot at an angle. you can use it with the & digiplug. choose transformation of free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are set in degrees. using button Preferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right-hand side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module has a horizontal and a vertical line available. after moving the mouse over the two lines, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle like in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture, you will find an unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is the function of cutting of cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. note, however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All Perspectives transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you must use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will then be recomputed automatically. on the right-hand side of the dialog you will find some information which you will help to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas which were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty fields created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: displays the actual angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: displays the actual angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture will contaminate a little bit. for single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments produce twice as strong effect and you should avoid these if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After taking the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes on the corners. an opportunity to hide this is the image with transformable cutting from the frame processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool tool is used to move a portion of the image into one direction and move the other part to the opposite side. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transmissions scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissure your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical corners. if you push the horizontal angle and vertical at the same time. if you want to set the angle to zero. a preview of the target will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To help you get a vertical and a horizontal line built. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to adjust the lines. you can now adjust the tool button to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the shot, the picture will be slightly negligible. for a single shot this effect is usually neglecting, but two chings are produced twice as much, so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the closure, the picture has the picture of unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate this is the image with Transformers cutting out of the frame processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">Digiplug comes; needs a number of libraries and other packets to read and write. those available in some cases, from the type of libraries are computed. in most distributions you will have a large number of image formats with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of other libraries, it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site. but you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">Digiplug-made; only files in formats used to the list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file in the list is listed below. you can change this list of file extensions, which can change. in the section configuration, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras can store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to choose to use the format. a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug are supported; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also be returned if this is indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw file format, you can read more about Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw formats images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw converter of & digiplug. in the section configuration you can find further information about the use of modules with & digiplug.</seg>
<seg id="690">Fasteners & standoffs digiplug; supports the load of raw pictures only with the program dcraw, which comes in & digiplug. all support cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coffin. table below shows a short list of raw formats used by & fixtures; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording short films. these clips are often stored in the avior or MPEG format; but it does not understand these formats and has no film editing feature. if you click on a movie file, you don't use the & kde; settings for playback of movies use to start playing the program.</seg>
<seg id="692">Go forward to the previously visited album in the Chronicles. you can only go back when you go back in advance.</seg>
<seg id="693">Synchronize the metadata in the database and all files of the current main window. the images are the metadata of the database and not differently, as with this menu.</seg>

<seg id="698">KIPI module exports a series of images into a KML structure. KML files can be opened and displayed with Google Earth.</seg>
<seg id="699">If you defer the steps 4 and 5, what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good, then you can perform the first four alignment using the white module.</seg>
<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo processing are included in & fixtures; included. their description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, softmarks, pressing, pressing, unsharp masked, & etc;. use a uniform dialog box showing the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture. below you see & quot; texture used; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress report shows the status of the filter to the current image. the links of him allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of view. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically split without duplicates. the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected area of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally divided without duplicates. the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">Vertical parts. the left pane shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Share horizontally. the upper section shows the original and the lower than the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'mouse over '-style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area, otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can switch to over- and exposure to overexposure. the used colors can be adjusted in the general installation page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to choose a preview. you can pick up this frame with the mouse within the picture and click on the part of the picture from which you want to see. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons onto your default values. all objectors of the last use of the module will be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="711">The sidebar characteristics shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-exploring. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Properties: shows a summary of the key parameters when shooting the photos. these data are taken from the EXIF data when these are available.</seg>

<seg id="730">Load large Graph (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to present more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & knotviewer; is a & kde; program, which requires the & graphical; -tool & dot; for presentation of graphs. you are needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window shows the open Graph, each in a own subwindow. initially, if you can start & kgraphs; without any argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen. in this case, the toolbar will only open the icon and the (empty) List of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files you will see the main windows like in the lower screen photo:</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization is available to localize images geographically in the spherical coordination system that is used by GPS and Galileo, to localize altitude, longitudinal and latitude.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS trace as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data to your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographic localization Correlator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to upload a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains, of course data that were added to the same location as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded by a automatic correlation, the coordinates must be recorded in red. GPS trace data are recorded at GMT time and therefore must be carried out with the GMT time. this can be done with the time zone. set up your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">Setting the maximum deviation for the maximum time deviation is a upper deviation for the GPS time and camera conditions. the difference between them are merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have a track data from a place for images you can edit the GPX file and add the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have the appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can put these limits here and then press the button correlate to the interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog box is using a call to the next notice, you just need to use the button OK to set the data with the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The localization can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it. in addition, choose the relevant region and enlarge it. the height can always be selected manually, until you have to be selected manually, the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a picture gallery of HTML pages. you can select the albums that can be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the rider can only select all albums. you need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right-hand side you can quickly choose a large number of albums. in the area, the Albenpreview and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider of appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is largely self-exploring. if you click on a picture in each picture will be displayed a new page. otherwise the image will be shown directly with your standard photo viewer, & eg; Kuchshow, shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be saved with all your corresponding images. choose a folder with the name KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected JPEG file format, the EXIF information is stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colour depth, you can change the standard color depth, of course also the file size. all other settings are explained clearly.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider color pictures allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the template, that are small pictures displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user to how far the action is. press abrupt to break the process.</seg>

<seg id="833">After launching, a picture is displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change pictures without sacrificing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images listed below, images in JPEG format, without any losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage, it is rising to the file size because no compression of the color information is taking place. this can be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera-client currently has no documentation. if you are interested, please contact the mailing list of KIPI Teams under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module is currently no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI teams.</seg>
<seg id="840">Using the import function of the metadata module, you can copy the data from a picture to another. then choose the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with any image formats. you can copy anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please see exiv2 to see what formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a series of images into a mpeg video in the form of a dip.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images in a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can add a base image file. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can choose the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to install the images that are packed into the mpeg slide show. after that, you can start with extras MPEG Diashau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should customize the other settings. if you are planning the video format from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD, you must default the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds to specify a picture. the speed of the image pass is fixed among them. a lower value creates very sudden, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and the path of the created file can be specified under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension to the extension.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file, you can start converting all settings your needs, you can quickly go to the production of your computer. depending on your computer's speed you can go quickly and enjoy a coffee, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths among the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer assistant allows several images to print on a sheet paper along with standard photogram. this is also useful automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is for example: useful to improve you or using the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command station dcrab of Dave Coffin. an original score by Dave isn't seen that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get there with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, first the RAW file will be converted and start the module. the Raw-Camera window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the converting process. the first option decides whether you are to use the camera settings like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers. if the result is not optimally, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats, and the converting result is equal, and only the expansion is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you have frequently used to edit your images or you later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select to JPEG image formats, the metadata are stored in the JPEG file are stored in JPEG file in the EXIF file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the button. if you want to break this process, you can break it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stackable mode allows you to convert various images to one time. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. through testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have here the possibility to overwrite the file. this is helpful, however, this is not available in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available on how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in a album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of a album. you can set the prefix, the starting point and the timestamp to be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the image range from the ImageMagick package. you can resize the image or enlarge four types of images:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, this option might use to adjust your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the photo for photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of photo paper. the target picture, including background size, border size and background colour is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send chosen pictures with your preferred email program. there is also possible to change the size of the set images before. further pictures can extract and place there on the list of pawed pictures.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having launched the module, the images will be displayed with the size of your chosen images. you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview on the right is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and add there to the list of images too.</seg>
<seg id="875">Using the button Pictures, the selected images are removed from the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all images, you can open the new message from your e-mail client click here. you'll need to add the addresses and the subject. the selected images are added already as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Be careful not to send you too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of the coming e-mails. it is possibly a good idea to send more emails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>

<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to any loss of files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG, if you do not have any fast Internet connection and the photo quality will not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG format and choose the original files in JPEG format, then the original exif5 will be added to the real pictures.</seg>

<seg id="887">The file names will show that the record will be displayed in the bottom left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">This option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then break it manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the pictures, the time interval can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly chooses a different effect on each transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During Diaschau, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move your mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>

<seg id="896">The KIPI module is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the basement, as a background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can see with & photo album; by these browsing, see picture. as you can see by comparison with the picture, in each group, in people, places and in the group Keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories you have provided information about your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to view the file structure on your hard disk, and of course the current template. in the following, each of them is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the associated entry you change the view of the browser. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select one more person only the images are displayed on which both of them are visible. by this selection method you can limit the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the places, places and other settings, you can view images to view the pictures of your unit area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, every person has the same symbol before their names. you can use & photo album; but for each person you can have own image image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images in addition to the names, select the view that you want to use right outside on the tool bar. please note that you can view the view for every category. that's the advantage you can view symbols with pictures of persons and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you don't own appropriate images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to determine which image for each individual person is to be displayed. now you can select the image editor, as shown in the picture below. in the safest window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and therefore select which portion of the picture should be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you find the entry in the main window, you will find a dialogue which is very similar to the dialog for the fixed image properties. this dialog can look at the image once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a character sequence in the field of label or description, the labelling must be searched or descriptions of the images after this text; the date may either use a portion of the entire date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">Using the Options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images as well as you can see in the picture. here it will be shown in pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photo album; if you don't like to read manual books, but rather like to test functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & Photo Album; and look forward the quickest, screen photos and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Run & photo album; and in the first dialog start the demo, if you start & photo album; for the first time, or choose from the menu to the menu entry-album; and then some sample images are loaded and you can test the features of & photo album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & photo album; as a related HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the time bar. a picture of this bar shows you here:. as the name suggests, this surrounds you record statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time bar can show you several different time units. each bar shows a different unit. you can switch between the units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the lath just 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be used on the following ways: you can change the displayed message view from the database (if you select a date, you will always see the first picture of this date displayed in the preview window) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images displayed if you navigate in the Preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of the time bar by pressing the mouse over the ruler of the time bar, so the time values, you will show you in the preview view only pictures of this period. you can pick up the selection by clicking on a beam of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photo album; presents you two possibilities to create HTML pages with your images. the one is in & photo album; integrated and the other as a module available in & photo album; built-in version, which allows you to create over the HTML menu File....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before using HTML pages, you have to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. each area is described in detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description which should contain the HTML file later. click on photo album; HTML-Example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you can choose whether you can see a & photo album; export file is to be seen on the viewing side. ferry information about export files will be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Recently, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is shown without the description. note that all pictures of a party are obvious. note that all pictures have been exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most insertion options are clear, which is why not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those who have a resolution of 800x600 and have a monitor that have the maximum resolution 800x600 which have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">You can change the resolution at any time you can change the resolution at any time. it can therefore search your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transfer time, if it would like to display a picture larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, place the various folders and the URL points where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">At best, choose a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub-folder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the main folder where all your images will be stored. this folder will be saved and added to the next time. this file allows you to select either a folder or a KDE support file, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can verify that this really is all for viewing. if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created, the URL should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet able to copy them in the final target folder, see, correctly, you have to specify the final goal of the files, but this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The basic configuration options described above are all three on the basis folder or URLs. in these, a sub-file is created, whose name you define in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting or somewhere else, with other users of & collaborative pictures, you might want to add a HTML page to viewing the images. however, you may need to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures, recording site, etc., then you have to do with & photo album; this work will not even make it even more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your images in a .kim file. these can import other into your database. these can be imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ to whether the pictures itself is stored in the file or whether in the file it is only a linking to store that you can put all images into the file and allow them to give this file as independent. however, the obvious change is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can choose a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches for the images that are stored in the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, so the pictures of the URL you are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images, which allows you to export over the menu File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether you should act internal or external .kim files. there will be the following three choices options available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you copy Manually to the .kim file, you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option, automatically copy the .kin file to the .kin file; the pictures automatically supports you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most pictures have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is really small, it is usually not able to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limit sizes. if you send your friends pictures, you want to limit the pictures maybe not in full size because the .kin file would otherwise be very large. here you can say the size limit, for example, that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importing... select & photo album; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to the importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder you want to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you can be the category of people who is to be imported in the event. therefore, you are asked in the third dialog window to be imported into what categories of imported file should be imported into what categories are to be imported in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can copy the categories of the file with the categories of your current database. one example will see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be simple to browse pictures and look at: if you see pictures, you want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend you like to see all the photos on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the various steps from (1) to search for information about your images, through (2) to search and see up to (3) Advanced themes and adaption options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program for managing your images. but it was expanded and today it also takes your videos. at many places in this manual we have talked about pictures, but often, this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; stores all the information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. it is a simple XML file that you can copy to a disk or revisions in the CVS, where you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; now remembers the folder where your images are saved and automatically used this at future Starts. if you want to read another database in & photo album; therefore, you can start & photo album; using the -c option, as an example: photo album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry dialog for Settings... you can proceed to a window that you can modify the settings of & photo album; in the following section of the user book, you will be explained in the following section of the user.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can set the setup possibilities of preview and the options for viewing will be available. you can call a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described in you how to define several properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On check the dialog, which is used to edit already existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog box options you can set complete members of members, e.g. all members of a group instead of one group instead of all groups of a medium as in explains.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the adjustment options that are available to the fixed list of members. in the above list box you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window side you can choose a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photo album; share its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digipam and gondview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. nearby information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called up via the menu modules. these modules can not be described as they are not described in this manual because they are not part of & photo album; but most modules have a help page, which you can call for the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together with other applications, it can be used to test the modules with & photo album; therefore, you should always call new modules at first with the command &gt; photo album -demo &lt; user.exe\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say, I would not have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI together, are very different, making it possible that some modules with & photo album; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you divide functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications could not support their images in albums. even if & photo album; this kind of order not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the features with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">The photo album is simulated & photo album; the current album that is simply the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview now displayed.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & photo album; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the setup dialog as Category for virtual albums. for example, if you're using the category people, you will do & photo album; so do if you would have selected people to view this.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select the modules that will be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a starting screen as soon as you can start & photo album; start your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are usual from any other KDE application, you can see a menu and a tool bar. under the tool bar, there are not much information about your images. in the section we will see on this window, now click on this window, now click on the images that shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphoto- album; is the opportunity to see each picture with annotations. this includes information about the people who have shown on the picture above. if you can see each picture individually or used for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if used on all pictures of Jesper and all images were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and Browse when you can read in the section. if you like, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In case you can set three lists with a text field by setting up people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photo album; because you will always use them again, if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the pictures within the list: if you are depicted a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people can be shown, so that the names are shifted upward, the persons can be moved fast and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to order a alphabetical list of illiterate list, click on the icon to sort by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected remarks on each picture individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with annotations. in this case, click on the back and back buttons, which are below the preview of the picture at the top.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, for example with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and select the menu item added to once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the United States as a overboard. in order to indicate that it is a group, a special symbol is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the attentive dialogs it is possible to add an entry to a existing or subcategory. in addition, you can also make an entry simply to a category and place there in order to order to a subcategory of this single. attention, this is preferred to order your categories in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the slide show, by clicking the top view of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by drag it out outside the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs to be satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options..., which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can even leave a frame fully off. if you want to retrieve this window later, use the button Options... and then window a / off. this process will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview of the currently selected images, or all images if you have no filter. for example, you can see the size of the image images, by simply to configure the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you want to view a picture on the back of your desktop, this image will be used as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this picture will be shown in the picture. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview menu. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete or choose either choose the button or select in the Edit menu. now, you will display the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photo album; the pictures also offers you a solution. you can also use & photo album; namely pictures even if you have saved on the hard disk. of course you need to record the pictures somewhere on your hard disk. in the picture you can see the view of & photo album; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut off, are not on the hard disk. for example, in pictures 5-9, however, these pictures are present, so you can view the preview of these pictures. you can't view this pictures even with the picture.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this feature you need to copy files from folders and again copying them. & photo album; if you want to avoid trouble you want to avoid any of the required CD, please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you wish to make a little more privacy, make sure that you may see for other unaccessable in the menu. alternatively, you can also see all the images that can see your little sister, and choose the menu item Everything except the current view.</seg>

<seg id="992">Please consider that this picture protection is not very secure. for example, all images on the hard disk and other one can read or delete the password as an unequal text or delete. this type of password protection is only used for those who are familiar with & photo album; not very familiar to weave the view to private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you manage all your pictures featuring & photo album; you need to describe it and hours about hours this is of course you want to consider them. from this reason you will find & photo album; this is why you can preview it out of the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer, of course you can see the picture, but additional information that you have set on the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can also configure which information displayed and if you are displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. the context menu click can see below.</seg>

<seg id="1025">Each object has a visible laser level. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the higher object or as absolute value. objects will only be shown if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal in the toolbar selected from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as preset. the object tree and view of the object characteristics are shown to the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window rules or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust it as desired. you can also save multiple window devices and change between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under one side view, pull the facade to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle is then displaying the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the link to the right or left side of a view. the new view will be anchored at the right or left side of this list and extends over the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on each other, take the address in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card cards back to the Views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window rules are floating views: views, which are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the fixing to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left corner.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the direction bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the menu View you can find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can store you back with a window of window... save a dialog where you can save the window rules when using existing or new names.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders them. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g for renders, this program was written correctly and Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the icon of renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any number of audio modes, from a fast preview of up to full screen in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the Symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or select in the menu View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each rack-mode has a name. you can only enter any name, it is useful but a name that lets you recognize the mode of mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can choose the width and height of the rendered image. if you want only a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image detail into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination of quality you can choose the characteristics, select & Povray; for rendering a model with complex diffuser reflections illumination. an exhaustive description of the Render features can be found in the userhandbuch on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, you can find various errors. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stepped effects in curves and lines, and sometimes they are not shown in representation smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing in order to reduce the influence of this error. in general, pictures featuring this property is better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn off Anti-aliasing, it connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique means super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is receded and adapted for rectional depth of the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray has transferred a ray per pixel. if the difference between colour values, then, both pixels will be adjusted with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated additional points, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional radials per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue in the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. when the difference between colour values then exceeds the specified threshold, the pixels will be tracked into 4 sub-pixel, which can be pursued individually and set to further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recycle can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to aliasing the aliasing effect is the creation of robbers for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams to avoid a tiny amount to avoid frequent patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The latest setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse reflection reflections will be calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this cardboard card you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the matching beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray is unfinished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; select the menu entry file importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently & kpovmodeler is currently supported and not complete the complete command range of & Povray; when importing error messages or warning messages, a dialog window shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this is adding to the source text of the object in the editor. simply select the source text in the editor and drag it to the object.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can also attach the source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler is created. it is usually this povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the corporate view, & Povray; the & Povray; user documentation of the displayed object. set here the path to your document retention and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field view in the camera view and in the window-type characters.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-catcher of points to the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give an more accurate wire model and a better sewing speed for the displayed object, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the ball you can set the detail stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross an advanced projection for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided, if the camera offers extended projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections. this property represents a better rapprochement for projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is shifted. the wall will be displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross the floor, there will be a bottom below the object. the floor will be displayed in a chess boards from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you want to activate cantatement method, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for the rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more detailed information about the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can modify existing window positions or create new window orders. in the section window orders, you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard-window rules: displays all existing window positions. & kpovmodeler. uses the selected window rules at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Extant window positions shows all existing shutting orders. a new arrangement allows you to create and delete a selected arrangement with button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Any window rules will be identified by the name. the name must be clear and cannot be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views of the chosen window rules. new views may add to Create and delete selected views with button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column lets you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with bottom card you will receive a card card viewing together with the previous view and the view is not in the main window, but generates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler is installed and now you would like to follow any more accurate knowledge of both programs. when you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should easily create the ultimate: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warnings carefully before you complain about the result that you will only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't use camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you will get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not include light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have any fault-free installed, you see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-installed window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get the menus and the existing symbols of the tool bar. read the documentation that you can expect a reasonable idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols now, therefore you should remember the menus and symbols and their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to remove this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object. select the scene and then select the menu entry dialog. that's why you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera sees all the scene you create. especially note that in the fourth wire-model (right below), this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the content of view object properties, where the various parameters of the camera will find. in the user documentation for & Povray; you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing at the basic settings of the camera, however, note that the camera in the view point has to change, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or the input button, the wire-model views and the object tree are immediately dependent on these settings. as a result, they see here the scene from the viewpoint of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many possibilities to create the floor for the scene. you could adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a constant method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler is actually an easy way to use. you can use an infinite level as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object, change the name and press the button user or the input button. in the object tree, the new name is instantly displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model-view also shows the level as well as at the moment only as a limited level. if you render the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you see the object tree, you will notice that you can fold the entry to the bottom of the object. in this case you will see only the default settings of object. in this case you can see only the default settings for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. choose one of these options, change possible settings in the view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to mark some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit several times in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog box opens up in which you can choose how the object will be inserted. the pigment will then change the name in the property view (name = floor-pigment), with one click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course you can preview the preview of pigments only a matte black material, because you are still waiting to preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click. also, there are many possibilities now, but take it the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you are looking to preview the color on Quader and ball, click first on the button users and then click the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now set. if you want your picture now with a click on the symbol renders, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course you are not able to enter the color chart. here are additional settings required. in the color list you need to do two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more frequently, but the dashboard colour list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the object in any object and change the colours in the view of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already run, as you should have the basic working methods of & kpovmodeler. already, the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: 1 (forget not to push the input or the button. otherwise, the sphere has been hed over the ground, as you have shifted the floor to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the renders now results in a self-like result: as already before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. set in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now show a material now. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">For example, choose the object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on ball pigment, then select unicycle and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the user or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings of shine-effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome finish, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression you who offers you & kpovmodeler. hopefully, you have already learned as much as you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracts a scene from the perspective of the viewer (i.e., by the camera that reflects the scenes) by each pixel of the scene, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and like the atmospheric effects of the light sources in the scene, and how atmospheric effects appear to work. so the scene pixels are processed for pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see a camera without seeing the camera, with which you consider the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simple. obviously, each scene will need, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In common file dialog you can choose your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Have you already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and enter a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Exhibits the scene in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage has been rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you don't have any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverse order. this menu entry can only select if you have processing the preset.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Records the current window rules and opens up a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or address an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, the shortcut and change the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcut. you can change or modify them with this option. you can change or add new commands to this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up the toolbars. you can add and remove the toolbars for & kpovmodeler; commands and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a possibility to assemble a smoker surface without any hives at the surface, and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric forms that you can use as a building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundred of these basic bodies. these models will then continue to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by applying a image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">The application features a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application features a file browser that you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in either own window in the size of the image or full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on & LMBn, or return Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image can be displayed in one window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a particular file, just type the first sign of the file in browser window. then a small input field appears in the right corner. when a passable file is found, the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog One - & kuickshow; available in three cards, General and machining and slideshow, you can adjust the working methods of & kuickshow; in the two other, short fault for the display windows and short errors for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images will be open in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area with the background color is filled, which you can adjust further down. the default is no full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, load & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still use the actual picture. this reduces the delay if you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuickshow; at the end of the last opened folder. at the next start a chase show; this folder will be opened in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bars to select a background color. it's used to fill in the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is bigger than the image, the background is filled with the selected color here.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can find & kuickener; so that only some of the file types will be displayed that the program can also display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option is extended for large pictures the display windows to the full screen. this option is switched on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Select whether the slideshow should begin with the first picture in the folder or with the selected picture.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time span between image changes in a slide show. in order to change the value, you can use a new value in the input field or use the little arrows to the right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repeats. if this value is set to 0, the slide show is repeated while repeating the value, you can use a new value in the input field or use the slider, or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Here, change the shortcut for the different operating modes of & kuickshow; in the boxes for display windows and short errors for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the sub-folders and a window for files) and a partial view of the file system with folders and files in one window.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde;. additionally, Amarok has even some separate command-options options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all necessary modules are present and use the dialog to allow the user to pass why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Desire "Corundum 'Rescue LoadError error =' Corundum (KDE binding for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is. for this script. '' dialog, sorry '# {error}' 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts, or simply determine that the writing of scripts are relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange your scripts data with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; that each KDE installation should be finished.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts themselves enable the purpose of external programs and commands. in addition, the function exec () is usually called exits &gt; relatively easy. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alings to all the scripts themselves. for this reason, scripts are to monitor their default input and react differently to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to view the setup dialog. to save the saving and load of setup data, you need to take care of each script itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the job folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signalized that a new piece is played. the script could now be & zb; with DCOP functions will ask more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize the menu to the selected files in the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry may also be checked, so that the script can use the clicked image file. to remove one entry again, you can use the DCOP-function dcop amarok script ATeCustomized MenuItem (SubmenitemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok itself; or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do for example cleaning and configuration settings. to this end, for example, the saving of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed by users & zb; such packages are basically normal Tsar-archives (.tar) that can optionally be used with bzip2 (.bz2), so the user may clearly recognize the archive as a Amaranscript package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the extension amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main crept should be executable (+ x), the remainder of the modules should not be executable. use the Tsar parameters -p to obtain the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to the Vikde-apps.org. you can attach the link to the Vii script side of & amarok; you should install the category amarok on your favorite screen.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK needs only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you have to install Kdelibs installed so you need some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts. we have written a small guide on how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD require that your window manager will require the relevant standards of freedestop.org. Gnome will therefore work with trouble. we try to support amaroK on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will probably make an error in the Taglib library for days. you can see this bug to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also impose the capsulated file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and release the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly, this is that Taglib when reading the meta-information from this file crashing. please report this bug to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only a blank playlist will appear. how do music pieces come there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In order to keep the surface intuitively, the start window was converted into the statistics window. it is included in extras Statistics.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the Gay-Sink, use the device to use a mixer. a mixer allows multiple uses to use the device at the same time and to run simultaneously audio. this can be achieved by a soundcard with hardware mixers (e.g. SBlive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in search of the problem of problems and a solution. for Gstarters you might need to specify a different scink (e.g. trsink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Doing so. do not forget that media needs to be decoded. you can just listen to ALL the best choice if you are looking for a decor with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decoded it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. gramer can deliver directly to ALSA as well as xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer Drivers (really great!) or optimise the settings of Arts. open soundfiles with highest priority priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (see next point at the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDED codecs, which can cause them to cause. read this error report. the enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA installation file .asoundrc can also help too.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts drivers but instead of GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.like & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Presumably use the Arts drivers. use another driver (the xine driver was strongly optimized for analyzer), or reduce the size of the Arts dffer in control centre and sound & multimedia, sound system. the less the buffer, the less applications react the visualizations. yes, that's a mistake, please contact us to fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I would like to switch to the Gstreamer driver, crashes & amarok branches off. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installation of GStreamer you need to register all components. perform GST register to record all Glimb components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC-channel # gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (terminate amaroK before!): - Charmpeg download it, compile and install it. then execute GST-config (you will find the module folder with GST-config / gtramer-config) and run GST register again and run GST-Registry. now you start & amarok branches.</seg>

<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-interface of & K3b; introduces functions like copyCD, format DVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createDataProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject () DCOPref createMovixDVDProject (). copyDvd (). copyDvd () The BurnCd (). BurnCdImage (KURL url). BurnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one obtains a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPref (K3b, K3bProject-0), you can obtain a project via the command line via # K3b --audiocd and then change a reference to the project via using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above mentioned K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">The createFolder (QString name) The createFolder (QString Name, QString Parent) is adored (QString Parent), QString Parent, The Qstring path, QString Parent, The Black String (Qstring path, QString Parent).</seg>
<seg id="1492">With it, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3becreateDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder folo dcop $PROJECT createFolder dacop $PROJECT createFolder / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder / home / trustice / dofile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& Easy ocreator; is an audio CD; -read for & kde;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s read and can be saved in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible depending on the encoder the installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (compress & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many Kodiers, who need these wav-files (loss of compression) and FLAC (lossless packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). additional coaxial cables must be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of & CD; read and compressed in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files are normally compressed in the MP3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has been compiled a precompiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this has to be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggbis (for OGG) or other Kodiers must be installed. all these programs are generally available for any Linux distributions, it is probably not necessary to compile anything else. if FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">The encoding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer provides a small introduction of coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & cranocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to avoid any copy protection. if not the firmware of the copy protection is not possible. even avoid the copy of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once must be done (the setup dialog can be called up to a suitable configuration), will be explained to the daily handling of reading a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to comprehend the slim approach of user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which coaxial programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can I get & CD; get more information from the freedb or can work in any network without any network.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands of the main window. at the side step by step example, more information, such as this program is used as well as screens with descriptions of the register maps for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">On request, the CDDB is on request of the CD data according to the installation of the CDDB registers. (this may be locally or online in the latter case, first the connection to the Internet must first be made.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and when a Encoder has been configured in the Controllers tab in the setup catalogue - coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">A sub-menu opens with a list of available encoder, so that the choice with any other encoder can be read as the default. it is too aware that the encoder included in the tab setting settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that a already used file to encode will be selected instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming events (such as reading & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog for & kaudiocreator; available with different card cards (such as encoder, for setting up the Encoders). go right before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coaxial and compression ratios, and helps you choose the right codiers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio-file should be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are other such as' hormone 'or' Monkey ', probably available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available non-commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats used by data compressing according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG files today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but via this bitrate, the differences are less important, since both coaches create very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions of free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (for high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality for lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or when one of the few existent OGG files is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also shown on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo systems. today - beginning 2009 - do these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting would usually offer acceptable for most people and most of the music of acceptable transparency, and has already very high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate of up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate of about. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enough for music of teenagers, portable devices and auto-control systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you definitely want to have the absolute highest quality without view on the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that are manually entered or transferred by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available as a list of parameters. you can be handed over / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code name to create the folder and file names and the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codierprograms there is frequently a combination of program settings for the code and the parameters here. the manual or the help to the code editors Explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add CD & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch-dd must be added from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks as follows: '... -tt {Shift}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters which can be used (= button-label of the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which the audio CDs can be loaded, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the computer. it is too note that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Ancm.) is not attorney. however, no one can stop that you are added by the & CD; more or less value, so can neither the artist nor the music company damage. all information can be understood in a bundle through a & CD; store, physically or virtually.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active a check box address (Send of an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used in the retrieve of the server (This can only know the programmer, who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freedb, the geographical closest of the next door server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and equals the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freed.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online call of & CD; or else you can download the whole database or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is the reader program used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">Rumors that cdparanoia is used; those who want to be more specific to check in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see Please note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must be installed first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the leviable WAV files, the code can be selected and the required file format are used. during the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab. other Kodiers can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the coefficient may be used. for more information on Kodiers are listed in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coefficient, you can receive further information about its switch through the input of a command-help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of the device recording of & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read listens to both cdparanoia as well as the audio coincidence of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;), try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that may indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of the & CD; this will not prosper!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give these tips as you must proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood but are somehow still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step by step example, and you will get enough information to create those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all setup and our first & CD; read, we will use lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps to average and ID3v1 sample (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution as it is not completely free software, since it is not necessary to compile source files, what you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you own write permission to it (eg; by attempting to copy it with the querqueror to copy).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is thought to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the approach to read a & CD;, which must be repeated for any CD & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use code for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we divide the program to use the freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it in any case of any & CD; change if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the password program so that it can read & CD; data / music can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device recording of your drive. if this is not working or when more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be accessed, if a try into the file / etc / fstab an attempt to get existing entries of the device drawings for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map card General Settings. here you can't do much too. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is shown in the screenshot as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for uncomplete information please select that you will be informed when information regarding messages of literal (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map chart CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and run the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during reading & CD; can be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or tag names, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Conquanti- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually fill the selection fields and freedb. however, this is about 620 MB large, if you want to use the database before. however, this will be selected twice if you need to check out in open mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freedb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieve the & CD; information from freedb server on the internet. how to get the system that data should get the CD? read the section about freedb. read all such as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we only want to work with the database on the Internet Server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freed.org and look after a mirror image nearby. on this way the load between the host is distributed. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function reliably prevents the server, since many Firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 standard regularly, there is maybe more thankful with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we want no & CD; data transmitted to the freedb server. the first check box should be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of a screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp is found on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: excuse, there is a reason why more than one another drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore just trying to try it.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: do this crucify around the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom file for temporary files: if you cross this crucible, then it must be saved in which the WAV files can be saved. if only space on another drive is specified, the box will not be checked in the private folder. if you don't forget this folder, if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything that is based on the screen photo. the order is slightly long, under circumstances, something has to be blown to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Notice the record '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the production of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may be deleted as required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' day for & kde; in case of late change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside of this sample:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: at a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That is, we just have the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organisational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described, such as the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk drive, the kind of music is organized on the hard drive, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from the freedb must be found in this section, must be repeated for any audio & CD; it must be repeated in this section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in freedb, see screen pictures a bit differently than those for a & CD; with successfully accessed by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually assign them from the internet. comments are noted on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD; into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as described in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified and by cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then search in the section questions and answers after the Help or go back to previous section concerning the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all tracks of the pieces are completed and additionally the name of the artist and album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">For the case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; gives, a window will be built, and you can select the database entry that your opinion fits best to your & CD; fits perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; default in the dialog for Settings), you can also retrieve it manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't collect local database, you will need the link to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the item in the first line of the 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to enter into the input field 'Update title', unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidips per piece, the Commentary field of the album is used for comments that apply to all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD Editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album names (e.g. whether all words with big letters or not...), but also to verify if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields to 30 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum this option is set on the Kodieraser Properties tab, and take a look into the section 'Fundamental Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the created files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all Kodiers or file formats. see the coefficient for coding, to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious to the style of the advertised CD; in this example, this is not important when we do not provide the & CD; data are not covered anyway. for more information about the website of freed.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD player appears again and you see that the fields for the album has already been recorded with the entered data, which we have listed for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item. the titles of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and procedure click the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear when you downloaded the data from freedb. it is sorted in one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the list list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of one piece. only the titles are selected or out. make sure that all tracks are selected, or manually fill the Select all pieces at the bottom edge of the screen to choose all pieces at a time.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button selection, the read process is started, so this window appears to confirmation. click OK then and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the riders on orders to switch on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the commissions. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen when you are trying to work with a coefficient, which have not yet been installed. they are not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the application list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have writing access to the folder for temporary files and target folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, check out and encode parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress the behaviour. the only thing that seems to read, the number of parallel processes is the result unclear. the calculator with a AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous read and encode (of however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order in the waiting time of the body is coded. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message is built in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & kde; 3.x resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you will need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music. some pieces using text gradients, other use liedtearing and another. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust what events should be displayed and even better: the event model is automatically determined, so that you need to adjust it manually. if you want to change the karaoke text, you will always have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set out a event type, select the entries from the menu settings or recitals. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these will be played the series after you. in this section it stands as you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager first. this will find in the menu collection under the point.... Click there to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than a collection, you can set the data required in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying the application, this collection will not be stored. consider that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you need to add a Song. there you can add a song with the button. it appears in turn the file dialog where you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song, depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece when opening (Open or drag & drop) is added automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the Collectors Manager that select the collection and the desired song, then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order where the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the next song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the knob preceding piece, the entry predictable piece from the menu or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the Collectors Manager, select the collection, and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection may not be deleted. however, that doesn't matter if they are not stored when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI-Events translates into events that understand synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in the type Change patch to Trumpet and is therefore always a trumpet sound when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a soundcard, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you must edit the appropriate file by hand (using your favorite ditor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file which stores all necessary modifications for the playback of a piece it stores.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. however, however, each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define KEYMAP "name of Keymap..." END define PROANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that it is needed to indicate that one section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, that I can operate in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices which are not general-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section it is specified as the patches from General MIDI to your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equality is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order, and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds which need this instrument to put on the sound with the number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which is similar to a net surplus. in addition, you take the following in PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So, if now, a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (defenses), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of what sound is written in MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant with that each tone is a more percussion instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;), and not the one that means sound the pitch of the always the same drum means (as some keyboards possess it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify sounds like tones on a defined channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keymon for each channel and each instrument. you must only use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymis will be used especially to form tones on the percussion-channel. watch out as an example the supplied Keymon.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to replace the first and second channel, make this very simple in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following model:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on channel N. if you use the keyword option, the Keymap will continue to be defined in the file. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will ignore all events that will change the patch on this channel. in this case, then patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussion patch on the percuso channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderIs is divided in which ratio of pitch-Bender occurrences will be multiplied by the value n, this with the formula one * (r / 4096) is converted and then only relayed to the value. the value 4096 is used to be stored in the map file (r / 4096).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM is giving up a keyboard, which should play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards up to one octave is higher than to play the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the MIDI Settings menu. you will find the menu settings dialog, item MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of clatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see that sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. if you have changed a instrument, if you have changed a instrument, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. view in the menu settings below the point of view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD displays the speed that a song is played, the higher the number, the higher the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you see e.g., a song may be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about it has to be played like a piece of music. it contains notes, the speed, speed, etc; so that you can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians who can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can hemit, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; which has been compiled because & kmid; without AWE support you need to download and install a source distribution (for example, kmid; 's start)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree that supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror; choose all files from and drag them to the & kmid; windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Automatically enable the automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can see the arrow button on the left of the template to slow down playback. in order to restore the standard tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -desk a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; if I want to play a karaoke file, or if I want to play a file, simply switch to the & konqueror; window will change and drag the file to the window by & kmid;.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only if you want to add a file without creating a collection, turn off the automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file will add a temporary collection to add files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you only want to play the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. thus, you want to set the automatic adding to the collection and open A.mid your temporary collection, then you will find exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you have to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">Those people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animated me the, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to add the preferred connections below the menu. if you want to create a list of entries you want to play together after each other, you should use the Category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain additional hierarches. if you copied one entry, his group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and play it with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and Daughty playlist may also be changed through direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only choose one of a category click here, but also by application itself. simply click on a name of a category click here to select an sub-group. due to the image of a sub-group, the XML contents will be shown only.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the menu must be selected from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the editing mode is selected or any other group is selected with the playlist box.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author by & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at starting and end can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaylist and changing [General Visual] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1718">The animation does not need to be short, it will be automatically terminated by opening a different source. this would be disruptive, the user can therefore terminate the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc. here is an example such as a 'flash with the module swf-Mozilla based:</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR is supported by kmplayer only Xvideo, XVideo should also work. this is why the videoforlinux expansion for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantitative lus; do not need to do with & aeraplus; this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can not wait until somebody is used in a large number of & GUI; elements can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements can be found down below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">In order to install a plugin or a KPart, we begin with the menu plugins and that the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage and add any new plugins contained. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search engine. when adding plug-ins without a storage location & Booaplus; this path leads to the search of the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often, in a project several people work together in a kind of hierarchical relationship between each other. & quantaplus; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the top name of user and serves to identify clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in project, such as team leader as well as Subproject leader.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of the team members who it is. this happens by taking the team member from the list and expresses the listens. the currently selected member (their identification) appears fett after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and notes. see for further information about remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the survey of the team, there is another advantage by the acquisition of the members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team manager if something particular happens. see also for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are promotions to be executed if something particular happens in the project. one example would be able to see the opening of opening and closing a message if a file would be backed up, or a script that will play a file into the CVS as soon as it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog allows events to be edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the address data provided in the receiver list. the address at address can be a team or sub-project leader. see, wei such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by the following items:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Note that note is simple. it can choose either the note document from the editor-context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary area followed by identifying text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Remarks can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role) is a role in the project of the following possibilities: team leader Subproject leader According to the enrichment and subproject names should be led, as in the examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roller name are independent of large or small shelling, but spaces around the clamps and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantitative lus; is a development environment for script and formatting languages, the DTD agnostic is and web-based formating and scripts themselves supported.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here you will be treated via & quantaplus; -specific settings, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be addressed via the settings of Quanta. this dialog box extends over a few pages that will be treated with each other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & aeraplus; regarding tags including car completes it can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / small exaggeration of tags: large / small exaggeration of automatically included tags. normal / Kleinschema means, the tags will be inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / small exaggeration of attributions: large / small exaggeration of automatically enclosed attributes. normal big / small switching means the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically shut: if pact, it is optional for tags, for which the exact day is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Standard encoding: the coding of newly created or in other way as with Open File Open files (where encoding the file can be transferred), but this setting is exposed to the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files or used for files whose DTD is not detected, but this setting is exposed to the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantitative lus; made with a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document of this backup can be recovered. this is not the same as the saving of the file. this is not the same as a backup regularly, according to the set time, created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editorial department or its own view (or the documentation in a carteire), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface caused by changing the MDI modes and andocken / depending on sight. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages section serves the control of the possibility to retrieve alarms by contact hook by no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place for changing the behaviour of & VPL; you can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronising behavior of the VPL- and the source view in divided mode. see modes for different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here is the parser and the structure of the structure, which represents the picture of the parser nodes in the document, in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structuring tree, the following action is possible to change the action by clicking on the structure construction with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure-tree settings the visibility of nodes in the tree, the actuators can be opened automatically when changing the structure. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such that no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for inserting abbreviations (a kind of templates), which can be unfolded for many & DTEP; s, it may be valid for several & DTEP; this means it can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause Abbreviation may be something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are the third page, which can be used by any KPart-enabled application, on the most well-known & conqueror; in the insertion of a plug-in must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin when it is not possible at a standard site like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be handed to the plugin when running in, so you can open the current file, the associated file (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in the "Just-read mode" mode: check if this plugin refuses to load the load. only real-read-kparts usually refuse to load if this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check out the plugin: this is activated, then testet & quantitative lus; if the entered information is correct, then if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantitative lus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely redesigned. does support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was discontinued, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented, which allows various implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin available which adds support for the use of & gubed; incoaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the monitor for a project starts with the selection of a matching debug plugins in the project settings. using the button options next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled, some additional elements appear in the & quantitative lus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that is displayed in the content of supervised variables is usually displayed in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view that lists all the holding point, with line numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower Dock system.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that shows the output (as in HTML) of the Debuggers. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the monitor, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this promotion, the connection will be made to debug, if necessary, or it divides the plugin plugin to listen to Debugger. this action is opened by default when a project is used, so that normally a debugger has to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counter-piece to debug meeting starts the meeting. closes the connection to the debugger or end the listen to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Transmits a HTTP requirement to the server by a debug-requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the issue of this requirement is displayed in the opinion of Debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger to begin with the execution of the scripts and the current run on the supervising variables as well as the current run run, the execution will be resumed. it happens before a debug has started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Shows the debugger to begin with the version of the script without informing any information to supervised variables and the current line number. if this happens when a script is given, the version starts, as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next order in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger leads the next order in the script, whereby it is possible when possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Indicates the debugger that go over and go to the next such as if the current does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is supervised. the supervisaged value appears in the variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adjust & quantitative lus; you can adapt to your needs and how to help you & activities.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantitative; used to provide support for markup- and scripts. your simplicity and flexibility makes it a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for Web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS; s, consist of two parts, the tag folder and tool bar. day folders are hand-oriented, symbolising bars of images (above the editing window) that include text and orders faster into one document, than one user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s may be created (see below), download or created automatically from an existing DTD. see details for details.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how the XML files are to be created, then the & teratrc; and also tool bar. short, one & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the property catalogue, the & quantitative representation; for the day shows. the schemes and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bar permit a fast insertion of tags in a document without any threat of a writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing as a folder. you contain only the & hintionrc; and the daily XML-files. tag folder bear the name of the writable language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the daily XML and if it is necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use, as many as possible, so many users can have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits are explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a daily XML document. it can contain only once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it can't contain anything else about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for day class class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type Method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute shelf and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Requires a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt. text &gt; Tag. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute a tags. this item can only be used for every attribute. it lays the name and the type of attribute. additionally, there are additional tags that should be displayed as this attribute should be indicated & etc. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Gives the source code used for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantitative time; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and an Methodist name. the arguments that will be handed over to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, this means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day included the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for a attribute. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attributes within one dialog. this tag can occur only once for every attribute in one dialog (e.g. once for every & lt. attr &gt; Tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and the size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each and lt; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the definetable tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Is a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All day XML files must begin with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be wagered and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Space character influence nothing but pay attention to & and lt. signs. these should be replaced by & amp; tooltip &gt;, and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files the tooling dialog box is up in the & quantitative lus; window to start and check the diary of the XMLA. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is not yet available yet. at present, check only when loading the daily XML files in & aeraplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; Element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this day XML file should be schema.day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example for a functioning family 2 day XML file. this file will be described in a & PHP; Overload function. the file name of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt.? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt. tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & actionrc; file is also quite simple and there is a editor, reachable via DTD Setting DTD. thus, diedeseprc; for a new produced & DTEP; it should be used for a newly created & DTEP; it should be created with following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = Use 1 for & quantitative; Version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be set up with Settings... created. click on the new action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action-weighted key shortcut. with clicking on the user can be assigned a button to be assigned; with Kone is the current shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered in detail in the detailed settings and inserted into the document in the document of the current cursor position. see Example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful job type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or as input (or parts of the document); even the quick start-up dialog or the various See can be found in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter will be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptest variable in command line: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There is other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file names are removed: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantitative; when it works, the lyrics will be selected to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantitative lus; it is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameter for this event normally, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the Project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script records of & quantitative lus; at the default location. in the selection box editing can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the requested application can be redirected. there are two types of issue: normal edition written to the standard output; error messages written to the default written text is set, by the value the selection field output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a custom tool bar. in this case, there are not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">As soon as a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure promotions. select settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are fairly self-explanatory. press the new action button at the lower end of the window will start the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use, activate one day when available, so that a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this icon? we replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol no more that the action will be represented better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graph more programs (or where else is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used as standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">In mind that the day start, means I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually used as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user may be signalized, that clicking on this symbol will be taken; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol no, it must be connected to the action. this takes place via the menu with settings... (in & quantitative lus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so it is even those who are or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some usual & quantitative lus; functions for tool bar add or it should adjust this for better overview by some Trenner in several groups. open the toolbars setup dialog for Settings tool bar. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (completely left) for my tool bar. after the selection of the element, which is added to the tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">I want to preview for example a fast way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner support the grouping. someone, who does not know my tool bar may believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by sampling all symbols to make sure everything work.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after new XML date does not exist, but your tool bar (s) should be saved in the correct folder. please adjust your toolbar (s) should be loaded in the correct folder. please adjust your tool bar (s) when a file is opened from the appropriate folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the notable extension of & quantitative lus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the formating language that you like. this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document system for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check the & quantitative lus; Repository if somebody has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formating / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. then we will deal with the second installment here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc] = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations, e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation section 1 = = 1.html Valid = tag2.html tag1 = tag2.html day 2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, see in PHP & PHP; documentation here:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2, = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Initix.html Getting Started = introduction,... Basic syntax = trage.basic syntaxes...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # vor Getting Started and Language Reference. that shows that it is a folder in tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess conditions (except through the Reason) mdash, but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the directory is referenced directly to a file (and consistent on the upper end of the Baumanhood & mdash file; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">No space influence nothing but pay attention to & and lt. signs. these should be by & amp; and lt; in all & XML; -based & quantitative and quantitative; Resourcendatrots are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The summarised section is the area of the docrc file, which serves to be displayed in the context of a text string and pressing Ctrl; H for context-help would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the Context list (ContextList) and the file connections.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file to $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc / doc / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then you create a folder (such as docrc) and copy your HTML documentation here.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and there are sure to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to the & quantitative lus; -repository for use by the & quantitative lus; -community. they will not be rich, but they are proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & aeraplus; you are not alone. it is possible to distribute the separating resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send by e-mail to friends, partners or else. at different places, there is an email with email to send the toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive from where all the other & quantitative lus; -users can be checked and only done when our team needs them as correct and used for the release. to use a useful contribution, for what it is a GPG / PGP key, that is the source of resources provided for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading are required for their private GPG key, or in the case you can have several key, you can choose one out. in the new resource, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can be empty) and with click OK the uploading process can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploaded to the menus DTD DTD (DTEP), tool bar tool uploading, and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before the installation, & quantitative lus; the integrity of the resource is warned by testing and the Signification. in case of problems, it may be canceled. if the integrity of the resource is given carefully and the resource will be correctly signed, appears with the specification of the owner of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which currently does not work by & quantitative lus; the creation can be used timeless because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tagonal format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. choose the .dtd file with DTD description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep file.</seg>
<seg id="2079">DOCTYPE file parts: the string that will be released! DOCTYPE tag such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / / / html4 / loose.dtd appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, produces & quantitative lus; according to transformation the & teratrc; editor, using the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & Renaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and full benefit from & quantitative us; this chapter tries to offer them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantitative us; little value to produce.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & maplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projects. this differentiation affects a number of components in & quantitative;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & aeraplus; uses, available. from toolbars over actions, everything is marked as global, to secure the group of administrators different toolbars, actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements provide a personal collection of web design for a single user. these are custom samples and toolbars. local elements are saved in user directory so that only this user can use personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS; designs up to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply, this is most restricted size. all elements are stored in folder of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & aeraplus; MDI; consists of some main areas: the editorial window, the installation views, the boxes with information and the tool bar. please beat in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the antenary with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document button, like close the current, other or of the cartridge, reload, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the editorial department leading to another context menu concerning the revised document menu (cut / copy / insert), editing the mouse under the mouse pointer or Open the file, if the character string is referred to a file below the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editors there is the toolbars of the Editors. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional works as standard to which a set of toolbars are displayed. in the course of further expansion by & quantitative representation, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and thus connected user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert it into your document, then click the icon to insert the day. now you should insert the data for this straight enter (like anchor), you can fill out different fields in one dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The installation views (QIT;) allow to navigate to the information of & quantitative lus; to navigate them to open and strip. in the display with carteireiters stand for files, project, templates, documenting, documenting, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantitative information; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or delete the files from the storage medium may be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & Booaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided in three categories, depending on which they are used. the category depends on & quantitative lus; global templates are always available, local templates for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only available in the project. more on templates is found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts themselves. the concept of substructures in Global, Lokal and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, you can start the script to edit or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view it shows the internal structure of the active document. by links to a element, the cursor is placed on the position of the element. by the right click of an element, a list of commands can be found in terms of navigation and retrieve of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other building views. with it, manure attributes and namespaces can change the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for web technology for your development. you can download it documentation for & aeraplus; you can create your documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add-specific documentation, edit and look.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes in the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This antitreiter shows information on each in Quanta progress script. so, for example, the used DTD uses the current document and all changes to DTD is shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This antitreiter shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts, which are done, give all error messages (such as those are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & aeraplus; tool bar are extensive, and easy to understand. show on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate bars is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantitative lus; is the ability to send a tool bar with eMail. & Booaplus; if they receive a tool bar in an e-mail, they can secure this in & quantitative lus; like any other backup and download!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It's reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantitative lus; therefore, autoconf might pass a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, specify. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble at starting & quantitative time; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folders. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folders. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantitative lus; is a web development tool for KDE surface. & quantitative lus; it has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During work, the best & HTML editor; editor to create, began the developers of & quantitative lus; an independent, extendable brand-up languages would be? well, this would make it an absolutely great Web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantitative lus; now, far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. combined, if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantitative; for that it should be suitable & IDE; for that it should be suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above mentioned claim, that & quantitative lus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; the idea of why some of them has developed? thanks to the & kde; rumor is not only that possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantitative lus; as much as they need it for their need.</seg>

<seg id="2120">Directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a character string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or SED with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window or not. that's the window where you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">The problem and enrolment of the problem reporters at the lower border of the & quantitative movement. the problem reporter is activated, as soon as you go to the structure.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol turn left from the main window. this column allows you to set the bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If the bookmarks in the current file, they will be appearing in the menu with entries pre-previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other documents appear in the menu grouped according to the file names of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existent project from the hard disk. & quantitative lus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory for new files that might be there. this enables to copy the graphic files into your project folder or a sub folder and add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapters & quantitative lus; projects you will find details of details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project-tool bar. these will be kept in project Dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the names. promotions must be saved using Settings.... tool bar will be saved via toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">If you don't have a tool bar from the visible area. if you don't have the tool bar yet, you are asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">With that, you can send their own tool bar to someone (maybe to the & quantitative mode;) so that the tool bar will be available in the next publication). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars on the main server, where every other can be accessed. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load an & DTD; you, or anything else has made and convert into the & quantitative lus; own label format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Reloading / citing the realities from the & DTD; it is useful when realities from the & DTEP; to renew the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, failing the load.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are loaded in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag dialog if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu Tags, followed by & DTD; specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or disabled the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. smart, means that & quantitative lus may refuse to insert the objector by means of a tool bar, if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>

<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document, using the selected & DTD; using the remote application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changeover between the different types of interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the changeover can sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the default card mode, which is also the default option, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantitative representation; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains one entry for every open window. with choice of entries, the corresponding window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the display of status bar at the lower edge of the & quantitative; main window to or out.</seg>

<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or which will follow and follow the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a assistance in the field of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantitative lus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free, but as with each open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantitative representation; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top of the project, for example after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be terminated with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example, foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantitative representation; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprej (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the machine address of the machine, which you want to access such data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you can be empty this field, the default settings of the chosen protocol is used. depending on the remote control of the remote host it might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files can be used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. several files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have a static content you want to download and change. if you need to download and change. if you need to download this script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;), one must be different.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Anew, when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated. if a project started to reboot from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to goodwill.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the shell, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be Upload in the menu with project features in the menu window in the window frame or with the scanning range Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in project assistants and are described in. the additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which can be re-read about project folders such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options on top, also files that are listed in .cvsignage are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The projections that will be loaded when opening the project. can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Thus the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the button Options. in this case, the troubleshooting can be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high-loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a building shortlist for each profile, showing a custom building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be edited, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, you can switch event actions and delete these actions, change or delete. event actions are executed if an previously certain event happens, such as the backing of a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project which was opened. this behavior can't be influenced by this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, Open Project... open from the Menu Project or the Open Project. the Open Project is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & Booaplus is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & there is enabled files. same thing happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project manager gives access to the files in the project. there can be the files in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">The folder is just as well, however the entries can be opened and opening with the right mouse button on the right-right button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Several profiles can be chosen here. the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables removing of the current profile. if only more a profile is present, the button will be blends to remove the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and you can forget it. this option is useful if common uploading files is needed and save the rather unsafe Password on the disk -option is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you upload your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantitative lus; you can create many high-speed profiles and thus loaded the project (or parts of the project) on different servers. in the editing or creation of a profile, this dialogue is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that should be copied to files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually must not be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your Anglivelvet, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password will be stored on the plate, so that it can not be read, but each with programming knowledge it can be easily seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and tool bar. there may be many views in one project, i.e., by simply changing the view, various files and tool bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the Menu Project or the Project tool bar, accessible via Settings tool bar tool bar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantitative lus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adjustment of & quantitative lus; to the own working methods.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & aeraplus; best on the menu toolbars are stewed. use and adding different tool bar will be handled by adding tool bar at the bottom section of the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and the symbols can be adjusted either by the context menu (right click on the tool bar), in which the new toolbar can be specified, tool bar edit or tool bar can be executed in the dialog where the actions can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to a single tool bar (icon) on a tool bar, the entries will be ready to remove and promotion indicated that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings toolbars... and set the settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically identical documentaries, code schnitzel and files for the link. you can copy, postpone or any of the existing directory with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any of the existing directory in the predisposition. templates have in & quantitative representation; in about the restrictions you need to set out for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some and quantitative templates; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions requested prior to usage.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary files are normally inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the storage space under global templates. further information on templates are available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, a simple report for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples may be found in the storage room under global templates. see here for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is to be inserted again in documents up to a complete menu control system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are in pre-storage space under global templates. see here for more information about templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve all sites as templates. you are a collection of various documents, which can be organized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & aeraplus here.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this happened, notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the submission of project conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2205">In your document, select text in your document and click on file as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be pulled out with drag and put on the mantle templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binocular templates is simple: copy the file only into a template folder. you can use all file management functions such as drag and shutdown or insert into the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the Project files Baumantra click on a folder right click on the right and secure a name for the template and secure. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or a global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal oriented precursor. you can create headlines and tapas or dynamically using & PHP; create, add files or linked to them. in addition, some things can keep using templates very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the underwindow templates are based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / templates / templates / Quanta / templates, each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To define the behavior of a folder in the introductory overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in context menu Properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field containing the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is low-hidden, as soon as the Atterous attribute is inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all besides the regular folders. if a standard folder would be disable, except they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, it would seem to appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you can probably see in a trunk folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows four or listed text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for any specific project and allows copying files to a folder with special headlines / floor lines a complete presentation already with the matching headlines / floor lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates of one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Monaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & the code editor that are accessible via the menu. the first mode will replace the source text editor in two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor is as follows: it invites you to see a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and cursor. then you can edit and when needed to save the source code editor, in which the changes carried out in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor, which contains a small green symbol the Vohandcrypt & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit these directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor, there is no plans to change this behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode is just like the first, except, that at the same time, the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the VPL; editor is activated, this mode is activated, when pressing the button on the active cursor of a window to the others, the position will be kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is selectable via Settings Quanta; view can be set between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computers and a large span for slow calculator.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the web page, it is possible to choose the title characteristics as soon as a new document is created with VPL; editor, as soon as a new document is created with VPL; editor. this allows you to change the suspension process. this means that you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow for storage of information about the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list enables the change of the inhaled, e.g. key words in column name and keyword keywords on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete. a change about the list is possible exactly as in meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to insert a external CSS style presentation by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is as usual in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare conditions the cursor still behaves as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be inserted by plugging or deleted by button or distance.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way via the tool bar, as in the source text editor. it's too note that the insertion of tags before already existing identical tags will not be removed, for example, if an anchor is inserted, every other ambient is needed to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars, such as the tables or lists of tools are disabled. you will later operate in & VPL; they will need to work tables or lists of tools in this release.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of styles. in contrast to other programs for styles is the search for certain elements possible and the execution of the styles can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; successfully compiling & kde; yet the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already installed at a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template, on a place in one of xsldbg loaded style or xml file or at the current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb compatibility mode, points can be specified in a specified file and line number and later activated.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools regarding the same. why & kdiff3;? let me explain shortly, why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merging was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and changes on many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in bringing together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence on the places where perhaps only the entry had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; differences in line and changes to white characters. later, many more useful features were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly the text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-merging is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece Kode. the file extension refers to the differences of conflicts. in this editor, you can even edit the result. in this editor, you can even edit the result. the screenshot shows three source files when merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you do with the same and complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; this screen saver features:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and diligently the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have enabled Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if rows are only visible in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at a summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble more if somebody changes the withdrawal.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the others distinguishes itself in one line, then the colour indicates that file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can make sure that the tipping work will make you complete the file names of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 file folder kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows manual setting of filenames, the selection above the file browser (file...) or select a last updated file from the list box. when opening a button, you will need to specify a third file; if you do not leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">About the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be selected, however, if a file is selected, then use & kdiff3; the file names from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merge is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to establish an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when we do it.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can define options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you would like to compare all the file, but only parts of one text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag files from clipboard into the active comparative window. compared with open dialog you will need to select any files, you can simply connect the dialog with the button button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and pick-up: simply drag a file from one file manager or selected text from an editor and leave it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which is thought about that? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how much these functions would be, you would need to compare two corresponding files, they would need to compare it in & kdiff3; download and then compare the relevant sections, simply add and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & diff3; extract. only the clauses of text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpreting the pulling and insertion of text into another program as cut and inserting (instead of copying and insertion). in such cases, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each window window, the info line shows the character A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window is optional.) Every Info-line has a different color. (if the path is too long for a while, then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring windows are numbered A, B and C. A has the colour blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one considers the colour that file is different. if both files distinguish, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings) the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's right in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. if white characters are not so important, it is useful only to see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white characters are only in strings and comments, for the processor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted by the digits, where the respective source file is activated. if the default file is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an Info-line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [gearing] when you have handled the result. usually, it contains a text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been dissolved, saving deactivated!!! (use buttons to the next conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two different windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which has to be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed, where the first group is not visible.) This group is then highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left there is a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, due to the automatic composite or manual processing, no further line remains in the group; then there is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps again a different source code. this text appears not in the final stored file, even in a mark that you may have to copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text can copy, but it appears in the clipboard if you copy such a text from the stereotype window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if when selecting the sources you ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or reviews are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly to the image sequence and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you like in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys on the left, side, end, Ctrl at the beginning and Ctrl end. you can also use it from other programs in addition to the vertical frame bar can also be used for navigation use.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using inserting button, you can change between the plug-in and transfer mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the compilation columns will synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section) and the editable output window appears).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / previous difference (Ctrl image downward / Ctrl image downward) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image downward) or to the next / previous conflict still considered the conflict. therefore, the conflict has to be distinguished between soluble and unsolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">In order to copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to automatically copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this option is enabled, then you will check it automatically into the clipboard. be careful with this option, because you could easily overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenants are stored according to the underlying operating system. UNIX versions use a Zeilenvortex-sign\\ r\. Kdiff3 retains the defending of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically and reproduced during the next start. (menu Insert - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a script with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog box illustrates the scriptures with variable width, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you disable this option, differences in short text are displayed. if the chosen scripture doesn't support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in its pure form but would be displayed. on these systems the default settings automatically introduces an unjust colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the tab character will be inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you push the input or return, the input on the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy falls into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line-type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files tried & kdiff3; first, all of all identical lines are ignored in the source files. the second step is ignored each line. in this step, the second step is not ignored each line. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car-back sign '\'. usually ignored & diffdiff3; the car backlog, but then could be displayed differently with different sizes in the side-on page. however, if this option is enabled, this option must be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '-') ignored. in the result the differences are still indicated but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as indicated in white symbols.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively after even smaller differences, the option is activated in default. it is effectively with complicated and large files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically non-skip mode, this setting is determined as long as the result of the selection will be shown before the opening of the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by choosing the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if the white characters are less important in many files. note that the automatic selection also provides conflicts to numbers or comments when options are ignored or ignoring C / C + + -comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan and execute a merge. look for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version will be missing the suffix. if already a such backup file with the suffix. original exists, it will be deleted without any further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must stop & kdiff3; exit and restart. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set to the control centre globally.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, all entries will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding, a short notice that the local coding is. (this can't be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this does not affect how special characters is treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have machined a file, you can determine which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessor error, you might not function with your codec. (e.g., your files may be encoded 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can define the coding of output folders.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress the highs of changes in white characters in the text or sutions. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when options ignore or Ignoff C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. however, you might be able to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; B, A & B & lt. -gt; C is displayed next to the normal standard column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available place on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison window by side or overanother. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and decide to merge the files. the current file will also work together. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file names of the last source file as the default file called for the output file. (if this function is used to run the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is exactly your demands. you can use this function e.g. for out disturbing parts or to correct the reset.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command is used (see above), then the output of the command is used only when appropriate. each input line has to have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is that the user will need more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, most users want to program an external program, and most users would like to program that. the good news is that in most cases SED or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for lines to convert the input into uppercase. *\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1\\ 1 found the found text in the first clammerncouple. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to be used by automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). the\\ _ BAR _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you try to experiment with SED, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may see that regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignored numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line-off. SED's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character is replaced by nothing, i.e. virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you would like to do more information on one time. then you can use Semiconolon ';' to separate the goals of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of SED you can also use something different such as perl. perl -e -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'alleres are needed with perl some details. where SED\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal pre-processor will maintain and maintain. additional operations change only the data that provides line-down-algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal pre-processor, the processor sear preprocessor uses the output of the standard Preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences, you can't notice certain differences in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmer have to edit many files in a folder. this is why you can compare and merge the complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal to assemble a proposal; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the simulate and show the simulated changes without being able to perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads selected actions either by all (F7 key), or just with the selected objects (F6-key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the same and compilation of individual files. you just need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders will be merged, folder 1 will be used as the basis. if no target folder is specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts, not the merge. to start the compilation, you must select the corresponding menu entry, or press the F7 key. (further details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you describe a small message window about the current progress. if you retrieve the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the file is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and any folder that has been found during scanning, is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories and fold all subdirectories with which you can open all the folders or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click on a file, the file comparison is started and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type file is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. if the merging action is not installed automatically, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, in columns A / B / C, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">File are considered identical when you are all content identical. then, folder will have the same color. at folders the age is quite considerable for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then in the three-folder merging mode C, B will be selected as the target and to synchronize A and / or B as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries should be indicated in the target folder. there are some options to be transferred in folder. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select a directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut action) to run the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory data types still invalid intersections, a message appears on faulty elements, you can choose to select a valid action for them.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit onto the pattern are displayed in the Elementary tree. can be used several samples. separate placeholder: '*' and '?'. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is not to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '? default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that conform to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be used more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as a separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '? default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder is specifically adjusted with a .cvsignal file. (see at info: / cvs / cvsignal.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a try-attributes. in other file systems a leading point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic link will be compared if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">With links to folders: if the option is switched off, the links are treated like normal file and recursively permeate. (note that link to a folder) will lead and recursively. (note that this option might result in a final pass and make-diff3; crashes off.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2408">A complete analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistics-columns. (the number of textured, ungster, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower, if they are based on files that contain any text. (enter the corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare great folders over a slow network, you may get faster, only the date of change and the file size. however, this option is necessary to use a certain degree of security. please use this option in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of changing. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when they have lost equal. for example, if copying the amendment item is lost. please use this option in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions are called to be identical. also the results of the compilation of files are saved in both folders. this option is switched off in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file will be suggested as action. (this is considered unsafe, because the other file does not have changed, you should check this in any case.) This option is default in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another folder, then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .origine. if a old backup file with the .original expansion is already existing, this will also be the default of single files, not only the merge of single files. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folders pane remains visible in the merging of single files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the directory and window windows to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare an file simply by double-click. nevertheless, you can merge a single file directly without the folder. once you can save the result, the status will be done and the file will not be reactivated if you start the file.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status comes, however, if you read the directory again: directory menu: new reading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open the files on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line is compares a local file containing a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. some Things You should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively small or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely right.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space character &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes using the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol. it follows a short list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then you will always have a file as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or changeability date. therefore, the calculation or changeability date from the original. (note the option to the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently available as the Differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in differences in connection. to play KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences of viewer and then select In Kdiff3 Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; 2 complete input files, if it is applied to a patch file in the unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then starts & Play diff3; patch program starts to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this is not working if not the original files does not have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; when part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merging or the same of folders will not support in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it's compression) is already available. Moreover, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can be merging such as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for very long and have much learnt in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have gone this way or go to it so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for user interfaces (such as kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated differently, but if only one non-white characters is different, the line is not identical as it's not identical. if the Lines is the next to Each other, this is encoded as this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is indicated for every difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. this important information is simply lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a separate file format that might save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has been so far too big. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit large amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly turned; No src left; appeared and the text can't be removed. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used as many colors for remarkable differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshooting reports from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use & kdiff3 functions; you will need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes will be found in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-you gives the folder to your system in which KDE installed. if you are unsafe, find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automaker used, you should have trouble shooting problems. nevertheless, please refer to the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or switching) copies in the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or reversal insertion) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are: files that are identical in all folders, and therefore do not appear in folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to re-read the folder with updated updates to this options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There will be only entries indicated that identical files will be copied to the target folder. if the target folder doesn't contain these files, they are missing after the compilation. (the behavior is likely to be modified in a later program version.) This option is default in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar, if you are attached to one of the buttons at the end of the selected group (if they are not already present), if the rows are already available, they will be removed during clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is disabled. basic differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minipreview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to change their current programs on the working areas, to end their size or move it. this works both within a desktop and in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications which can be selected and even move on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a working area and other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on it, if the right mouse button is clicked on if on the empty background of & kpager; however, the context menu has been clicked on the application within & kpager. if, however, the context menu and the name of application, as well as entries, to maximize, maximize the requirements and entries. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window onto the full size of mind. only when on a application was clicked on.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only if on a application was clicked on.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The check box is marked, windows within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other worksurfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, will be displayed in & kpager; the names of virtual working surfaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Selecting this field allows you to display & kpager. view the numbers of virtual working surfaces. it's together with name, then the names will be ordained, and eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as a background in & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & kpager; otherwise only the empty space surfaces will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple right corner with the proportions of program windows. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; the main window can be determined: classic leaves & kpager; in some other windows; horizontally, all virtual desktops in a horizontal row, what is very good for the display on the front of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniature in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in the size to display windows as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent retrieving switches... will appear the dialog for Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, it can not be changed in the dialog for Settings. but you can finish it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you have no write permission for the file, you need to sign up to your system administrator. in this file you have to set the key windowtransparent mode and to this value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen magnifying. you can use & kmag. you can read a magnifying text for sounds or accurate viewing of a photos. this includes artists, web designers and people with a vision. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application which is constantly improved to improve new functions. it is optimized for use on high performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you see & klikes; start a window as shown above. the main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged range of the screen. in the following, this window will be displayed as a magnification window.. The image that is displayed in the magnifying window is a enlarged range of screen and is labeled in the following as a selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting it can be enlarged & kmag. alternatively, you can see & kmag. additionally, you can illustrate a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection process) or the environment of the mouse pointer (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse pointer in enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the default-kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection process mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouth buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse over the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture the contents of the magnification window. this also goes with the arrow buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you add additionally the & Shift; button or press & MMB, you can move the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection dialog. note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; possesses a lot of functions. you can copy the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy to the clipboard (to add it later to other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stops the update of the display. the stop of the update causes the required CPU time against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (very low, straight, medium, high). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area will appear in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically use your set short commands for saving files, opening a new window, printing, neulades (using button document again in & conqueror;), Enlarge and Veroters & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">I also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen magnifier; you can use a magnifying screen in order to view the clutters in a newspaper or photo. this application is intended for different people of benefits: from researching or artists to a web designer or visually appealing.</seg>
<seg id="2495">Detailed user documentation can be found in help: / kmag (enter either this URL in the address bar of & konqueror; or run it helpcenter help: / kmag).</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulated a mouse click when the mouse pointer a while at the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from the RSI syndrome (repetitive strain-chosen syndrome) and which every mouse click painful pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click, once the mouse pointer a while at the same point. it is intended to help people who emulate the chosen key pain (RSI) Syndrome and those who emulate every mouse click pains. also, it does require a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; may circumvent pain, which is created when clicking on the mouse, and helps you to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer pain, which use your computer when using your computer, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clear it even more: even if & kmousetool should avoid pain, which arise when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the user because of all ergonomic aid supplies: the result can be explored for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movements and leads a mouse click when you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break, after pressing the mouse button. now move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion. the smart move requires a little exercise but you get used to get it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">The residence time must be enough after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool should cover a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If the case is turned on, the script is enabled (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool will be waiting, before using the mouse button, if the mouse button will leave you again, if the mouse has temporarily stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now it is enabled by clicking on the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. such movements will be stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ straw kmousetool; the first time is started, however, they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can reduce & kde; along with it, the reaction time can be shortened. open to sound & multimedia, select the sound system. there's a shooting sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at any start by & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other windows environments, please find the respective documentation to find out how to get there a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog box. if you have already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to access to the last pressing of application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially using the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shifting should be switched off. if you have used the automatic mouse click, you can later push the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times by & kde; if you need to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in browser window, which does not pose a link. you can therefore use the mouse to such places, until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is trucked, you should clean your mouse. that is normally pretty easy. the trick is not easy to clean the mouse, but also the rolls that come in contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as it happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear if you see the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">When you have removed the ball, you would need to see the rolls. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can be scratched with a flat blade or the fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system crashes the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started shifting the smart move, it means that & kmousetool does not mean; the operation can't leave the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a window manager under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem exists to run even a mouse click. this will be returned by the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor on another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Workaround: use the mouse to place the cursor position where you want him. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of mind when you don't feel any key mouse clicks. secure zones for the mouse pointer; the grey areas around the toolbars and the cover parts of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I do not create it to edit the text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is a advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time to copy it into the clipboard to move it into the clipboard or move it to any other action when you want to move the mouse with a pressing mouse button. but it will probably need to get some problems here. here are some advice about it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart move not if you just didn't start & kmousetool; if you just hit a mouse click here. at the end of the text area, press the mouse button pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and again convertifully the mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "land dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readern has the highest priority. it will be withdrawn from all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen Reader is read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is getting too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will be resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority priority. a message is subject to normal text. & kmouth; is an example of application that you can read messages. while you welcome you can ride a long text on a website, you can ride to the space. & kde; Alerts are also news. read the news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text applications. each order you can attach from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that use text applications. text applications are intended for the issue longer texts that have no special impact.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in maintenance-long, except the output of screen readers. when an application sends out the output of a screen Readers, while & ktts; just such a reading, this issue will stop and terminate this issue.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reinstances. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and textbooks as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter processing the text and give it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filter are designed as modules. in the future there can be further kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Substitute parts of a text string that can replace parts of a text by other text. it can be shipped either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; it is possible with predefined character strings as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>

<seg id="2633">With speaking selection filters, you can depend on the contents of text or depending on the program, sent to a speaker. if you have set a female voice, you can read text by KDE messages about it. read about it about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has set the rules, according to which he is applied for a speech output. if the filter makes it not applicable, he will continue the text to the next filter.</seg>

<seg id="2639">Enter your name for your filter. if you can choose any name, it is necessary to distinguish only from the names of the other filter.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces him in accordance with the drawing string from the column. the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for a voice output. this standard contains stamps for the control of voices, voice speed, voice and voice. furthermore, stamps for the control of the identification of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is a part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently & ktops; SSML only partially and only available in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the default, the festival is used in the release of SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuality filters (SDB filters). this means that the first proposition must be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also skip the entire text order, even if the voice synthesizer is not directly supported.</seg>
<seg id="2728">For the first start of & ktops; the first start of & ktops; it will automatically be set up automatically as a set of propositional detection filter. you can add or further set limit filters, but the start is not rounded.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way to check out the device selection by pressing. switch off the speaker selection and specify the text to read. switch off the speaker selection again, change some characteristics and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. in addition, you need to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the preliminary start can begin, since only the first set should be processed and not the whole text block what can last long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop text applications on the card card or terminate when the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit filter will automatically set up if you can start the tsp for the first time. it cannot be removed only. change nothing at this filter, unless you know what you do.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The sublimline filter allows the text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tobacco sign (decimalcode 8) to the set boundaries (automatically removed from the text). note that the standard set of propositional detection filter maintains the value of the set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (keg.), warning, messages or the output of screen rears.</seg>

<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is just downloading the rpm package and it is easy to install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively a tool with graphical user interface can be used like kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde will not be sufficient; but in addition, the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This will only be experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology is given, the second will be reviewed by & knetworkconf; change configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more information about IP networks. in this section, only basic information about the integration of the PC will be conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 is not expected that it will continue in the near future. this description therefore focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign network drives, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator the response, which can be used as a valid IP address, if necessary, the IP address can not be chosen as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from an especially suitable for this purpose. to avoid IP address, addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course you can access the Internet for such machines by adjusting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 is usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually put on 255.255.255.0, so that all machines have the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. it is usually assigned to address 127.0.0.1 of the called loopback interface, which works as an attached circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where it is stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file will sometimes be changed to DSL connections, so it cannot be surprised, if in case of active DSL connections, another content is to be found there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple files on a tape. the first target was to create a surface for tar, selective unpacking. the second purpose was the answer of a question that my wife said: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be bound by & dat; it can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; spult the band back and reads the tensioning information of the tape. recognizes & kdat; the promoter in the band will not be asked if the band is being formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the promoter, it looks for the matching index on your disk. can this be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes well, the symbol is changed to the tape drive that the band has been mounted. in the Status Bar, a message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched out through the tape's entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before checking the tape, first the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">And dat; gives a change in the symbol to recognize that the binding for the band has been solved and indicates a corresponding message in the Status Bar. the band can now be cast without a danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat is used, it must be formatted and formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A bandage must be formatted before you need to be used to store data. this procedure does not need to be formatted before use. if you need to formatted a band before use, this process is usually done by the band of & kdat file. floppy disk drives usually put a formatting of the tape, DAT drives on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the band is lost, the band is automatically mounted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you get to the backup process, you need to select the required files. this can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a bit. only the so selected files and / or sub-folders are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the Sickle menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been launched, the dialog for backup. in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog box shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archive in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the files in the entry for the band with a hak. only the selected files and / or sub-folders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archive and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure was started, the dialog for Settings. in this dialog you can check out your selection and change the application folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears to demonstrate. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can restore the restore files, the files you need to be recovered. this can be done on two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that include the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files from one of the archives with one box. it will only be converted to the selected files and / or sub-folders.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Click with the right mouse button on a file or folder in one of the archive and select in the menu!</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process was started, the dialog for Restoration. in this dialog, you can check out your selection and change the folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog appears Reconstructor. this dialog shows the progress of recovery process and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes, it is necessary to regenerate the band-indexing file using the band content. this process deletes all existing Indexfiles for this volume. you can create the index to two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the straight marked files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a secure profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current workload in which the backup should be made. the list of secured files will be updated automatically according to the just selected application folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files listed under backup files, that only the files are protected under the same file system, such as the folder. file, which can lie on other file systems, can be used separately under backup files. each entry is considered tar independent of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup file, a snapshot file will be saved. only the files have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">To remove the snapshot file before the call from tar. this causes that all files will be backed up and a new snapshot will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons & gt; covered; and lt; files wasn't completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu of KDat menu in the menu settings.. make the following settings for the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must be transferred to the non-rewinding type of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting, transmitted & kdat; before the tape release, the command is loaded to the drive. for some disks, this is necessary before read- or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, tries & kdat; the throwing at banding work is unlock. it does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the band is switched on and automatically the bond is disclosed. use this option does not use Floppy-Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, tries & kdat; all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to be & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band is formatted and write a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file sets itself as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this character is host: seconds, with the host name of the system is formatted on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is using a file named HOME / .kdat file, using the same name in the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar -archives that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not the incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a securing tape. this symbol is only active when a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& kslog log; is a & kde; viewing for system log file. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, or where system allows you to obtain information about your system or where system allows the various protocols; experienced users can access the fast access to the example on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksellers log; helps users to understand what your computer is doing in the background. the program is capable of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can find information about your system or where the system changes the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & kslog log; experienced users can provide for fast access to information on problems that occur on their server. & ksellers log; tries some expanded functionality, which can be filtered and analysed directly with the help of the protocol.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & kslog log; a number of useful functions. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, you will cover & ksgalog; functions available, with which help to make the individual protocol lines of a protocol file and sort the individual options for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & kslog log; initially, you will not display the system log file; you will not have a small message window, so you don't have a system administrator right. the protocol files can be found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar in order to filter the filter bar. in the default setting, the list of log file is displayed automatically, so that only log file is displayed next to the filter entry. then, a protocol line is only displayed if in one of the columns have the filter search term contained.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also choose another entry, of course, also choose another entry. the strings of the filter search term will then choose the column heap process. in addition, in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so you will show you & kslog log; all protocol lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you recognize the major protocol lines. protocol lines of stage error are displayed with a remarkable color as protocol lines of stage Note. the display of protocol-lines can be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you would like to display certain process (for example in the system log or in cron Protocol), so you can check the process identification (PID) in the column. this case may be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you will use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to the new lines of the main window in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kslog log; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open additional subwindow and to manage. once you have chosen a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksellers log; has a dedicated website to http: / / kslog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the source of & kslog log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksellers log; also find the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: kslog log; in & kde; Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather well-known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section takes some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init develops quickly to the standard for control program starts at high driving of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible is the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go on historical aspects (e.g. because I know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The inite binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe somebody could try to make a machine on system V Init, without a new installation and new format. therefore, you must be sure that the old init was removed from there, in case there was one there.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from the BSD increit that the configuration files are located in a sub-folder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. place, rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a complete script for every system service you want to start driving on a different runlevel. system services contain such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services involve not such things such as setserial, which only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should normally be on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also do a rc.serial / etc / rc.d if you want to run something to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program, and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-cleave runway 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can try / etc / inittab by hand, then you can get a bit through, then you will enter it by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it begin to enter the right scripts? if you want to enter in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very simple: every scripts is written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start this scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would read the httpd server. init reads the names, and when a K contains, the script will stop with the argument. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people require a simple way to create machines for many purposes. I might have & eg; a server -Runlevel have, that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; also I could have a user-track, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another hand device is simple to say trivial: simply drag an entry out of the availability of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop to stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift the scripts from Runes or change the position within a level, by clicking on it. thereby, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they draw out an entry out of the availability of your availability.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries can be postponed when you move it into a new area. to choose them just to choose from the menu edit menu or from the context menu, and even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry can be sometimes not calculated. in such case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding memory before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no possibility to restore files that have been thrown in the trash basket. be careful therefore.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the various workareas (available system services, round level 1 stop, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous day.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another round level, shift it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the type or name of a single entry manually, press the tab button to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by clicking the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to refuse the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. otherwise it is available. otherwise they will be available by & ksysv; otherwise they are recovered by & ksysv; changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runnings, and now the machine is constantly revised. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default round level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have a few system services with & ksysv; available in runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type of system services launched in these distributions simplifies the configuration for proprietary investment programs in this distributions, but unfortunately not yet the standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are located in the proper directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) are simply without message if your config files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can even be from version to version different. if you use a different distribution, please send me more about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kusers; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is enough to read the chapter adaptation of & kusers;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made modifications, you have to save them. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the entry Save in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two boards, user-user and user group rankings. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user or group characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are displayed only if you have extended system settings. only if you have placement limitations (Quota) for users, a carting card will be created, if shadow-passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map card password will be released, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD -Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears, if necessary for at least one single file system limit (Quota) activates and initialized (detectable in the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, with the limited data limitations in KB):</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for any file system. the current filesystem is selected using the field of filesystem with placlimitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card group informs about the group's height of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, will be in the Primeric group. furthermore, the user can select in other groups by selecting this in large field.</seg>
