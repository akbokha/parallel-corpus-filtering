although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extremely large .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have read and operated American authors .
in fact , this country had a der@@ ar@@ est pro@@ found effect on me , that I was mainly because of a US film journalist .
when a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gar@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ ful repor@@ ter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura @-@ Stud@@ ying , who had the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my ad@@ mir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming , that you are always the fact that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people .
I had written a very warm love letter to his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me as he goes with his narrow face .
he holds his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he expressed like a former colleague , and declared publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Latin@@ os , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican and women .
nevertheless , people were respon@@ ding to his statements and approved in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can Presi@@ dential elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans that support those certified person , do I ask myself ?
I could not take Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ tors not to people in harmony with people during my time in Phoenix .
for example , I was Professor Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist , the people from around the world , a deep un@@ beli@@ ever , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; this was also backed by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present publisher of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; in agreement .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the Phoenix S@@ uns &apos; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is also reflected in contrast to the gener@@ osity which I strug@@ gled with Sandy B@@ ahr that f@@ ights for life in the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son .
still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and help my colleagues to get us at the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew L@@ eck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my Ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me much with my career .
these people and they were scattered by them my love to America .
during his way back to the republi@@ can presidential candidate , she b@@ aked me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
however , it was obvious that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the strug@@ gles with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they were either having rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism because they were ready to over@@ see these things , almost the heart broke me .
perhaps it is un@@ fair the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a c@@ assi@@ sts .
the people are classified , said one of my friends , is exactly what led to us to this situation .
this is super@@ fic@@ i@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and thinking .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations will not be taken into account .
could it be that those voters are , of which most are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to recover the control over a country , which they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in America ?
perhaps perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ n@@ ick that commented upon the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities , &quot; The eyes from white in play to the White and whi@@ pping ash , which means that great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has so great .
million people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America means everyone welcome .
for this land was elected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ ian@@ ers , whose story , as he himself says , where else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , a huge part of the White &apos;s promise has grown up and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and all the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas , after 9 / 11 , the white man again say on the ru@@ der , they say .
in all these things I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration of Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , had my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , has a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud sound &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; Muslims had any position in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; m@@ ül@@ ed the amount .
&quot; did Latin@@ os take a seat in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , has a place in your America ? &quot;
he got an impressive and silent &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan ended with the words : &quot; God is than@@ ksgiving , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from El@@ end to the Stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t leave their love to music by rub@@ b@@ ish ?

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
the music that is played at both locations , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca and # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among the tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ colonial ruins and of its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : one of children and adults existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which with their musical instruments have found a way to overcome them surrounding poverty .
a school with 100 students is become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in Oaxaca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest of the Mexican provinces of Mexico , is known for their abuse and mis@@ use .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press not@@ ici@@ as Oaxaca N@@ VI said :
as soon as they come out of the school , they walk back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion .
they come always l@@ ach@@ end and with shining eyes and play in the bust@@ le you day for Tag trumpet , tromb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from gar@@ bage
more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the kids of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which is practically above the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay , on instruments which are produced from restored waste material :
music with recovered instruments , which consist of local hard waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the se@@ per@@ es into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , fr@@ ying , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trumpets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music by the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez re@@ members a local ec@@ ologist and musician teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ sing and we had to teach at the same place because the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a out of tr@@ ash produced .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recovered material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ ing Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world generates around one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the p@@ oo@@ rest - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
survey@@ ing harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ing spect@@ acle from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team work will fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that f@@ ights against pir@@ ates f@@ isheries .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has been specifically reported for international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the realization takes place within the scope of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to joint use of Content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the Eastern African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly brought into this form and a bit inclined , a Legislative Decree of this kind to its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que , and Seych@@ elles mobil@@ ized rapidly against the ship . they refused to accept one of their har@@ bours and refused to divide it a fishing boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply denied all these things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u , a conduc@@ tive employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship in the time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it didn &apos;t manage to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of fish stocks .
the nu@@ cle@@ us of this initiative that protects criminal practices and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ishing F@@ ishing ) .
members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that the Premier had driven out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are is@@ sing and working together . you can find themselves and stand on each other where it goes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is defined by definition . is hidden , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to wear because of it , the illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain hab@@ itats and species are protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm a delicate balance .
however , during the actions against illeg@@ ally f@@ isheries were once hin@@ dered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and with the information between different countries , the actions occur in real @-@ time , with tracking at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries may exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news to susp@@ ect activities or details that could possibly be noticed or experienced during an harbour view .
fish @-@ i pursued the activities of ships also very atten@@ tive when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this enables to mark the authorities to mark ships which fish in forbidden areas - such as susp@@ ect driving conditions - such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and eventually whether they have a criminal off@@ ender .
countries that are against illegal fishing catch can be found on the basis of these information so that the ships may not be able to sell their cargo . and that they even could not be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s significant financial losses for the owners , meaning that the illegal fishing catch is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is what we want to reach , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that assi@@ sts in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already known platform was created to have lost 20 million USD to lost sales . the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose each year because of the illegal fishermen , which penet@@ rate in Eastern afri@@ can waters .
East Africa is one of the most productive t@@ una fish plants , which attrac@@ ts commercial fish @-@ fishing from around the world . under these also illegal fishermen .
to whose practices include actions count as the sailing under false flag , f@@ ake lic@@ en@@ paper , speci@@ fying imag@@ inations , fish protected species and the fish in nature areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use the lack of international cooperation and take the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not say a ship illegal and a country could say &apos; You &apos;re not able to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this sam@@ pler Schl@@ up@@ flo@@ ch attempts to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front functions .
since its founding , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects .
it has corrup@@ ted the criminal off@@ ences in Tanzania , the counter@@ f@@ ake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it wor@@ ries ships and found .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight of crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the work of organizing crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to be suspected of several ships in precise ships .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be enhanced , helps you to hide the illegal tr@@ acked ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tr@@ acking , an N@@ RO who also offers f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be used by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects various information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually take influence on the und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch along with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ anna accum@@ ulate with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who doesn &apos;t do what makes sense &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to uni@@ fy and to bund@@ le their resources for research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts must run a similar project with which a global system will harm the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als , but also retri@@ ev@@ ing them .
ships that were previously explo@@ ited without license and would hardly believe with consequences , you know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile been a 33 % rise of fishing sales , ever since f@@ isheries are able to purchase more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia were helping out Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board locks , whose usage is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also noticed these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that now other countries have become , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are one study project . &quot; in West Africa , we disappear several hundred million dollars due to illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries have joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . even they fight against the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With safety , the aim is to create more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member country had its first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without license and were not allowed to be forbidden .
the ship was also used in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the action of measurement against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against pir@@ ated fishing . &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time , proof that such special , collab@@ orative work is actually working in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times , and the Guardian . location in Venezuela spread further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to recover the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seems to be only the beginning of a wave of strong demonstrations .
they shall apply as a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government had refused to meet the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Ven@@ et@@ ians re@@ acted to empty the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they met in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ de@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the back@@ ing of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be guided in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat area Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally located federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the State of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes a lack of food and medicines in everyday life in the dental vene@@ ers in the everyday life of Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans .
many representatives of the Opposition saw a fundamental change in the official practice of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro was the chance to change a new election of the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of government decisions as follows :
within the context of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation rate is among the highest over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and enrich@@ ment lack of food and medicine , the referendum to be given to many as the only way to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the elec@@ toral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad tur@@ á@@ tica or short mud ( approximately : round Table of the Democratic unit ) , where the proceedings against the president of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro were to join forces on October 27th as well as a march to Mi@@ ra@@ flo@@ res Palace , the Venezu@@ elan government headquarters , should continue to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

the first demonstration within the framework of the Action Program &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October .
the images of the mar@@ ches that will be published in real time , testify among others a overwhelming involvement in people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ acy of the government .

particularly large waves beat the message via police disaster in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the protest@@ ers went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed gu@@ ardian of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police force , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear coats because otherwise you could see anything that many National gar@@ ners don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that the magnitude of op@@ pression is derived per day :
thus , the dictatorship has op@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had challenged the validity of the demand according to a commission procedure - this was shown in the eyes of many noble people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :

here is your official practice !
on the road !
another step in the fight against a government carried out from its point of view over the devastating economic crisis and would rather be able to leave the critical votes :
they took us so much , but also fear !
the march will always take more to frequency and intensity .
some dental vene@@ ers reported the media that they may be hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview recorded by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , as the origin was published on August 23 , 2016 to D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argentine news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba .
in the meantime , Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano said well , in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial , in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship were committed .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano has not sought his life .
starting with the brush , same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he kept his family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
as a child with 15 years of age do not notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I was not able to recognize that my father was a thief , Fol@@ der and rob@@ bers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano was his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy chief of the intelligence service 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano .
archi@@ val intake .
however , this is not the history of Luis Qu@@ i@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressed that is charged for kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities which he had experienced as a boy in the course of years , and who testified before a court against his own father .
its history shows what great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the Sports Hall to the Military base
when my father started to pick me up to the military base , I often went to the Sports Hall . there I had a boy with a boy that was fighting for mar@@ tial sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are an ar@@ ous@@ y , you have completed yourself with one of the ERP .
pass only that they have not left you one day , and I will save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolutionary Lu@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
so he banned me to go back to the Sports Hall . a few days later , he took me with the work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be okay . for so my father had taken me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all possible documents : university Stat@@ ements , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propag@@ anda material , books , just everything .

&quot; as dr@@ as , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times in La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small , wrapped up in a blank@@ et and ordered me to wear it into the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were removed and kept myself with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open room and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I went in , and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were fixed at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just fast@@ ened up there .
they drove a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ shot him with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts into the gen@@ it@@ alia .

the smell there was horri@@ ble ... as a dirty wine .
when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget that smell .
and I asked me : how is it possible that a man can do so much evil ?
&quot; I knew that people were killed .
when my father started to work for the third time he conducted me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where det@@ ain@@ ees were sh@@ ackl@@ ed and band@@ ed them .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also accused of trial ) and took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were under the face down - all were bound in hands and feet .
near the entrance cr@@ ammed people still quiet@@ ly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father observed that I saw to the prisoner , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you say , ar@@ ous@@ ed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I met &quot; Why have you brought me anything ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were classified as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there , killing a man .
( according to the information of survi@@ ving the civil ist Jorge Rom@@ ero who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera Process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Molina came to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the leader of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way where you came in , is also the way where they came back here .
if you see on the map , see that they took about this path and then have been tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process of human beings .
when they survived torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ an@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the dis@@ appearance of its cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things by home .
at that time I had no idea of what the &quot; war spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it .
but when I was in the military , I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military police , which one has fought against the enemy .

but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothing , painting , money ... sti@@ ff@@ ness , then it is no war@@ fare but v@@ and@@ alism .
it is th@@ ole .
I always asked how my father , head of security forces , could bring with this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime and I answered : and you , who desc@@ end on the road ?
you are no crime ?
he explo@@ ded before rage , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself .
there is no one to others !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory to him .
when I heard in the process , I showed a photo of at that time , on which I had a jacket and a roller swe@@ ater . both had my father of La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defence accused me to have been involved in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay me a load what they wanted .
I was so anyway to speak .
&quot; the dis@@ appearance of Lei@@ che is the last ab@@ h@@ or &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel Reu@@ e .
I have children . if you only have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
good , you have executed man during the dictatorship of Man , but what makes the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children escape ?
one day my father brought a girl with home whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they would have been able to put them in jail .
I guess , it was just decided to kill these people . but for what makes it disappear ?
did this people not have families who could have been handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of Lei@@ che is the last ab@@ h@@ or that one can do with a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoner .
they were torn down and somewhere on somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but anything remains always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to say it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
just I just said the truth about 20 crime - including my father .
the thought to show my father , arose during a conversation as he stood under house arrest .
I was able to see him because of all the atro@@ cities which I had to see his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have never killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt r@@ ushed and cared for me , for the whole Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; that they allegedly def@@ ended it , actually well .
and then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed a terrible crime , and you have been forced to participate in me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did exactly that .
in 2010 , I was the first ad .
I finally recognized that he was a bur@@ gl@@ ar .
no one can submit to me that I was vo@@ er@@ sti@@ ff . I finally told my own father .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; awesome motor@@ ists &quot;
the shield with the translation error to a center in K@@ YO@@ U can be extended in which one can extend his license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers have been a newly opened centre in which one can extend his license , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation .
in one shield , the Japanese word ( co@@ incidence of sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; means , f@@ eit@@ ful - maybe even with a great rear @-@ behind &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; &quot; a fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance and building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n published in K@@ YO@@ U :
&quot; how could it come to so an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation .
this is an ins@@ ult of elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes .
the def@@ ective English translation was removed first . the designation &quot; The drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mage was not the correct name &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the pre@@ fecture of the Kyoto pre@@ fecture are pre@@ clu@@ ded for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text , and that the translation was not tested for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was released .
a blog@@ ger reported how follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re sorry that elderly people were insul@@ ted by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news dienst J @-@ C@@ ast News set up something detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was made as an un@@ reasonable description of elderly car drivers . according to the police there are the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents throughout the country , but are absolutely reason to worry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents by seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors killed 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this puts its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of seniors caused by the same period has risen in the same period .
the nam@@ efully called repor@@ ter brought comments on the published version of the article , comments on light which show that pre@@ dat@@ ors some Japanese seem@@ ingly ask for older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) about reality ? &quot;
- &quot; so bad is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there aren &apos;t few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is spread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true foundation of this bizar@@ re error in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are mani@@ fold .
you need two important capabilities : passive voice skills to understand and active language skills to understand and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active rule of target language - a little while native speakers in the case . generally , the persu@@ asion that trans@@ lat@@ ors should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue .
thus a French mother tongue was to be translated from English to French - not from the French in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese enterprises do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue that might have translation into English . this may be a lack of understanding to translate , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers , Japanese to learn .
some companies who have no foreign employees have made translations , but then the Japanese staff , whose English know become the best estimated to have been trans@@ lat@@ ors - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and av@@ eng@@ ined propositions which arise through mechanical translations , show that this technique might not yet replace a human trans@@ lat@@ ors . this applies especially for some languages .
some of the strange English for@@ g@@ ings in Japan , including the av@@ eb@@ ral prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like or@@ naments still acceptable or at least harm@@ less . but by major companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect careful translations .
the city of Kyoto util@@ izes a serial source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and interest relief measures on the Internet and television
the main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ el@@ con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to PR@@ EN@@ SA , Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , ven@@ ez@@ oli@@ an Internet users found that they have no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet Security is not accessible from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV as well .
the other online transmitter also contributed recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , that the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros have been rev@@ amped .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection may be connected , and recommended the user to get VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ elan providers are closed again .
this is from the page by @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offerings like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular in vene@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of distur@@ b@@ ances .
traditional media have been on coverage since 2014 . at that time , the Commission approved T@@ elecommun@@ ication with money charges and closure , if they would continue to report on demonstrations by the Commission , as the Commission looked this as &quot; entered into force . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have applied to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ non@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay could not only be accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNA ) , but also two further online channels . this also includes the website that the National Assembly transfer@@ ring their sessions .
formerly reference research of the institute for press and society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , prove that the local websites of Internet providers had to use it . there is a technique through which the DNS server requests a certain domain .
if a website is blocked by the DNS server , the server answered correctly or ref@@ using the request for such a website .
we confirm a DNS c@@ re : @ el@@ y@@ oli@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was discontinued on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera El@@ vis Flo@@ res , who was transmitted live in Caracas , was put into prison .
Flo@@ res was defeated , while he was located in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connection , that the Ven@@ et@@ ians make access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls are too slave to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimonies of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were just like them victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Kur@@ dish , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which they did not have lived together with the family that lived there .
just before her academic studies at the University she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house of pride came over her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who had become something from something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was not treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . Cri@@ ad@@ itas in Paraguay , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes her min@@ der son or her min@@ ating daughter to another rich family . in exchange the child receives food , a education and a roof over the head .
but what it is not stated that the children have to make countless days of house@@ work must never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all of which cannot be raised within the context of a contract .
this Cri@@ mean pre@@ defined practice is widespread in Paraguay with the involvement and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous dis@@ closures of human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organization responsible for the rights of boys and girls .
she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimonies , calcul@@ ated and p@@ eg@@ ged .
she tried to name the things by name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since it is both the family , who do their daughter in the faith to improve their position in society , improving their position in society and can make something out of itself , &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl with themselves and whose exploitation is just@@ i@@ fies with faith , that someone would give someone a chance that would otherwise receive any training and maybe even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will be experienced many years later .
sometimes they get out of it .
in January 2016 , this was relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret plant in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came into hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed fier@@ cely stro@@ kes . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military school Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official collector when the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck Fer@@ re@@ ira until the end of January 2016 , until they suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girls .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stated that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela applied deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest against Protest@@ ants and demanded that there is no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; she def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions do boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the sp@@ ouse and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a fast study of the case .
they want to be sentenced to 30 years in prison by Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only explo@@ ited as a labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers where her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy , and her father lost his work .
your brothers had to go all work and started to sell on the road or on the market of swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the name As@@ unci@@ ón in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so they had to share the time so that their time to learn .
she got up every morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
as an example , she pur@@ ified the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture , and preserv@@ es the ground .
when school was ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with the learning , the more leisure had it .
but this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to never hunger , but got not unlimited dining . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house@@ holder as food from the refrigerator . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the house@@ holder , a journalist and sympath@@ izers of Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
in addition to some ab@@ oo@@ king of the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and guides from the opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to persu@@ ade the reports of the official media over the regime &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept it for intelligent , but kept not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who list@@ ened to over politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had not allowed me often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I heard &quot; bad al@@ hab@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belong to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak at home again her native language gu@@ ar@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they were the education that they had allowed to lose it again , explains them .
it was , however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything she had paid for them with their hard labour .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ min@@ ated in school . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken , mo@@ b@@ bing and ch@@ ic@@ ans , to whom Cri@@ me are subjected to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone , who has no parents , has a cri@@ be ita .
I was able to invite home to me . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friends are , I felt very clearly that I was not one of the group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a fac@@ ebook group that can divide vac@@ anci@@ es for cleaning and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay .
the administrative division of the group is Pep@@ a Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a town hall in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion to my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .

in the third commentary it was written by &quot; a girl from the state inner that wants to work . &quot;
then the author of the ad split once more :
Dear friends , I &apos;ve found one . I look , if it works with her .

the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenom@@ ena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users social media to register in the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes from Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliament deb@@ ated recently a bill to &quot; the regulation of usage and uses social networks . &quot;
if it is assumed to be accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt to government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a site would then be set up to share issues of citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with the acceptance of the law , users need to register their users on the site of the site with their correct name and personal@@ ized numbers to use social networks .
if this is missed to do this , it may bring out a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ r@@ ots and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs on the Internet and communic@@ ating with others by voice , video content and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when the law is being accepted , since the draft is not supposed to en@@ ligh@@ tened the user &apos;s use@@ fulness and users who do not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Rah@@ ar , parliamentary member and the promot@@ er of the law , reported the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users , and users received a user name and a password from the T@@ elecommunications Ministry , to enter the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall around Facebook . due to those , it would need to be necessary for Egyptian and Egyptians , information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such projects exist .
experts and experts on site are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the pre @-@ sl@@ ags .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , explained Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt one of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
my opinion , they imagine that , as it could be used for for@@ ci@@ ble physical public and private spaces , it may also be done online .
if I accept them , then it means that it will need to be a powerful monitoring system to provide a permit or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the human being and to bring them to a judicial process .
this is technically not so realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft version must initially be discussed at the legisl@@ ature of Parliament and the Constitutional Com@@ mittees , before it comes in the plenary debate .
whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thinking in parliament , in whose sense , control is supposed to be maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating Nar@@ ration is present on the screen area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ . .
last year , the Parliament of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a bill of law against Cy@@ ber @-@ crimin@@ ality in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for those who are being found guilty of threat@@ ening the &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq work the animal protective H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq , to protect the spiritual Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which leads through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their living space and because they are always less prey .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video , &quot; Per@@ aza is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem , also depends on that a big cat@@ fish is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free wild , is small and goes against zero . as the team is therefore fixed that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza stopped in pure joy .
as educ@@ ated Bi@@ olog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which is not only of war and conflict .
since six years she has been involved in trials with wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is responsible for ensuring that protected zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o is documented in the north @-@ east Japan daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o , which were affected by the life of them in the last six years . an enormous earthquake , an ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai which is in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a permanent pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan , which both experienced the earthquake and resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neigh@@ bors between Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear entire coastal towns from the map .
even though the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report from the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o shows from local view@@ point that progress reached six years later to re@@ build the life of local dom@@ ic@@ ir@@ ation .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( E@@ ver . , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima forms the final light with 70 percent .
likewise , there are still six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ u ( E@@ ver . , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to be moved to final spare parts .
after the triple cat@@ astrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such cases .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency , whereas more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated who were shel@@ tered after the des@@ aster in accommodation , have been transferred to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ah the number here is 34 percent .
the stand of works and everyday life in the three most affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , have opened its doors to the end of December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it says that industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
whereas almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now returned to operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of fishing ports have resum@@ ed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land have moved large @-@ surface in mit@@ igation .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is un@@ likely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of the cultivated fields of Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened in the nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered well again , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off .
tourist tax@@ pay@@ ers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ rest@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima happened here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o Newspaper also reports that almost half of the coastal towns , it is more difficult to earn their hab@@ itable .
is the native population prepared on the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine a total image , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ation . she asked them about the stand of reconstruction and even as their indig@@ nation has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es have been done .
how it stands for those who were evacu@@ ated from the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ enn@@ o @-@ Zeitung has strengthened its attention , also on the location of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima also had been a witness of the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ic accident , amongst the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
at the beginning of 2016 there were somewhat more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima living outside of their home @-@ pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated areas are still standing in tourist accommodation , because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . they are building projects , which are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if people meet men from other countries who speak a different language , the differences may first appear bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , you often recognize that a more common than it seems to be at first sight .
these global connections are important , since they re @-@ demand our advantages , extend our perspectives and remember that the world finally is very small .
in this sequence of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look forward to exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat threads that often get fewer attention when they earn .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone on the language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ voy says about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa says about the time that they worked with people from around the world ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about its experience in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma , after being joined by the police in national demonstrations by the police
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 years was delivered into the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer had defeated him in a demonstration against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against savings banks .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , had suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fre@@ aks .
doctors established him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officer , recogni@@ z@@ able with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the examination of the incident recorded by active service .
the pictures show the police officers , such as he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer must be checked by a demonstr@@ ators and placed on the intensive care unit , his face would be visible for six months on television and the entire op@@ pression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ pens@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed the video on the grid , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several san@@ itation soon to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , living in another country , Internet uses 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and allow to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during his family .
&quot; be a bra@@ ve , Mat@@ eus .
against police officers . &quot;
drawing was dealt with several times in social networks .

Professor Pablo Ort@@ is@@ ado is calling for additional non@@ violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political power : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me had been murdered by his father , because he was attacked as a deser@@ ted school of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has attacked the very sad case , after he attacked from a polic@@ emen who struck him with a stroke .
police trans@@ missions
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived from police operations against demonstr@@ ators in the last Friday .
police officers were set up in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rub@@ bers and tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the de@@ pu@@ ties of Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) asked the police to abst@@ ain against demonstr@@ ators against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report written in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media is inspired by the Brazilian media , pointing a focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a well @-@ broken glass windows in order to create a photo of the title of photography .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o delivered a title story with a set in fire .
there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests thousands of people who serve the defense of a special matter .
this must also be recogni@@ z@@ able if you stri@@ ve against any form of damage .
here , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is a ab@@ sur@@ d , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate , and the typical non@@ violence of the military police are dis@@ gu@@ ised by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on con@@ front@@ ational course with the police &quot; .
the For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba by the Ab@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization of Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane fabri@@ cation in all of Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the Church Liber@@ al Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - on Spanish Sug@@ ar ühle , regardless of what there is no significant loss of sugar levels .
it &apos;s two years ago , when the activities were manufactured in the sugar cane factories .
after the erection of the sugar cane industry in the region , and the factory lost after and after his facilities , until only the rum@@ or of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes the work .
other re@@ signed and comm@@ u@@ els daily to the factories which are still grin@@ d .
N@@ ene , a solo veter@@ an , who opens every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke its sleep .
he heard that it was in the east of the sugar cane factories , which are in operation after long in@@ active time , because they have been preserved .
that was something what he was not expected .
N@@ ene is remin@@ is@@ cent of the fact that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resistance already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for the country for some decades , but the bad harvest@@ ing are already no re@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway path of the congregation saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane fabri@@ cation were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive , they were in@@ trag@@ ically for the country .
the initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the Sug@@ ar Crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar prices rose again about one decade ago .
between 2017 and 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food @-@ Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar imports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything worked well
&quot; today &apos;s Day is going to go down in history , &quot; the first words of the Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro , during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane fabri@@ cation came out , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 . May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repeatedly is repeated , &quot; deceit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to receive the place , they presented a full time - working group .
before the beginning of the beginning of the beginning , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written about the documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , add@@ ressing and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ja Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve each withdrawal .
from there on the responsibility and the letters were always more common .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for two years for the shut @-@ up factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in @-@ run sugar cane factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years of age waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , whose construction he helped .
with each part that he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial range from Cuba and the most important work producers was removed .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , then president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that for those working , their factories were not in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population of closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the people learned Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich that many things change , but not always to the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar tube factory was closed , or better , when they began to ab@@ dic@@ ate them , they list@@ ened to asp@@ hal@@ ted the streets , this also offers other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region at once .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety and forty seri@@ ousness ex@@ alt the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
LORD N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a supplem@@ entary person , nevertheless the lies he told him , not .
they have been tor@@ mented for ten years .
N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pension , not because it is missing on strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations Youth use Hi@@ p @-@ Hop to express yourself and get your own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First nation .
photo used with approval of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
youth of the first Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them . they do not do so with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour bring mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live cuts .
the original workshops were headed by David &apos;s Ped@@ agog@@ ues , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec , with ten Cre@@ e communities , and then with Cre@@ e Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars worked together .
the workshop is putting something that the young particip@@ ations in the talks , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever of them comes to sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organ@@ ise similar workshops with the trunk of win@@ eb@@ ago at the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Y@@ oo , in the field of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ around First nation in British Columbia , tells the story of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , at which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous women have disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ hi First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by global@@ ization .
many of the songs appeared in indic@@ ative languages , although the yo@@ ungst@@ ers do not rule in language @-@ speaking languages in the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation will have recorded the ref@@ rain on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help of Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group that followed them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an is available the st@@ rop@@ he in the heading as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel when no one ever would be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to go on earth on earth
this is the day when you take out our Schre@@ i
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will be lifted up for one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so , they can grow and lead the way of our youth
thus , they can do it , for which the cre@@ ator has determined
in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of Cre@@ e @-@ Language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in sil@@ os ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with approval ) :
plastic in@@ doors are not only shown in the restaurant
micro @-@ dishes ( E@@ ver . ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

one can see plastic dishes in Japan almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers , what is located on the menu , are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ u ( it is mandatory , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are exposed by every food that will be served in this restaurant .
customers will see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an industrial sector devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes prepared by the German filmm@@ aker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a in front of more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usual that they are not even more striking . however , a new trend is turned into the con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous mobile phone accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
in N@@ aver Mat@@ ome , the blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series , published by social media links and photos that show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin renovated .
now in special sales : new with plastic dishes - decorative tubes , as they are shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ esur@@ fing collectors , such as in this case , refriger@@ ie mag@@ nets :
here are a few shock refriger@@ ator@@ ie mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) has been turned into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we also have this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like a apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing departure .
some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own art work . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe uses , a popular T@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doub@@ ts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also receive a less appet@@ ite shape to surprise for example colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant .
our latest mobile support has the shape of mel@@ an@@ king &apos;s ice .
Moreover , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and straps of dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s N@@ aver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter The h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , to the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin renovated .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic products are actually produced .

the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cartridge , ur@@ ged the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background .
the day after a violent incident is hardly anyone looking for the g@@ rief or to the churches that have learned to live with pain .
there are behind each side , behind every bon@@ ding in the hundreds of secret graves , stories , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds could never heal .
therefore , the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ t@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ é@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug tra@@ ff@@ icking to live &quot; ) , which they will give up a voice and stories of people telling them in the fight between the prosecution and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organiz@@ ational crimes can not only be feared by our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many congregations will need to drive many kilometers to buy as milk as milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as a fear of life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who sear@@ ches up secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father &apos;s four sisters , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have given us to go and go to graves after the people who we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , for I am now with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also with me here .
she has no income at the moment .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not get paid out because they ask a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we just do not have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must present the international community the conflicts to show the frag@@ ility and the State .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some ex@@ cer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a writing by Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central and Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what it occurs :
I already know illness and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism now for some years .
I pass the title page to the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling when I am the one that is ob@@ struc@@ ted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be equal , or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants to become great when he is great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
for me , this is what if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear them , that something happened to them something like that .
I see our weakness when stories are going to be naked figures in a statistics .
the number of people &apos;s el@@ ess@@ ness is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified . &quot;
I think they try to speak that they spar@@ es from such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they don &apos;t touch and still remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of comp@@ res@@ sive in the Capital area : like a family with dr@@ en@@ ations , &quot; she describes herself , as an armed crime month for month money from their business until they didn &apos;t just destroy the business , but also their family had torn apart .
you think of everything you lost , and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
his pain will never forget that trau@@ ma remains , and fear comes up again when you are alone .
hab@@ its have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
we continue from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are or to kill you .
I asked me in these terrible days , if weeping would solve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot to know how to get weeping . I must learn to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he has asked questions : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crimes ?
how is it to increase in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he says he had to kill himself , how to make a egg , potatoes that makes Tort@@ illas warm and called &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each age of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood had already gone over two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody Lei@@ che of his father , who was shot from armed men out of a driving car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation existed in Ju@@ á@@ rez :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world , due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the German government Council , the government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office were 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country .
only few stories are still alive in view of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who we have not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ é@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; , the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ the@@ are launched in 2015 , whose goal is to summar@@ ise the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the past four decades , in a defin@@ itive way .
if a picture worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he left , include pictures where violence is represented .
the factor check is important in one moment , in which it comes to lift a rum@@ or or f@@ ake a f@@ ake .
but how is the years after anything the first time is di@@ pped ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , it ten@@ ds to exist further .
this photo was taken by a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) seven years ago .
since its first release , it has been used to manipul@@ ate trag@@ e@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this in@@ correct copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Draft News - An@@ ders not the fact that it gives plenty of careful report about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but there are questions about our desire to talk to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neg@@ lec@@ ted , as it was rav@@ aged , the streets in the region have become a full swing of b@@ lows that were difficult to drive .
the car , however , fell victim to the victims of the tank .
a representative agent described a fire ball , the demon@@ ic houses , including a cinem@@ as near , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer world championships .
houses ro@@ red and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
an image with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the pre@@ set form the gr@@ au@@ ous scenes of this day .
above is an example .
it features rows of stolen body , which are attached to the ground during people .
but this is not the end .
more than the years the same photo was qu@@ en@@ ched by several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but certainly not real this in the related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the det@@ on@@ le@@ gen@@ ic settlements of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
Aug@@ enz@@ eu@@ es reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and prayers .
there were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were killed .
but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said one of the human Rights Watch .
many were z@@ elled , shot or burned .
only from satellite images the follow @-@ up can be illustrated .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the armies in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerg@@ es from the DR Congo again , as it f@@ ests as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of patches with flaws ; Africa Check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was prescribed as a cover for mass@@ acres .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example of the DR Congo on the sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange has also occurred in conjunction with the dead@@ ly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
according to a lightning , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posters like the following in which these descriptions were collected with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , which , in 2012 , the president My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an met , mon@@ ks and politicians had involved in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the picture from the DR Congo to assess this information .
the original entry , which last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies , the AF@@ P as their source , had also appe@@ aling this statement , but had not to cover the picture from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these wrong con@@ jun@@ ctions go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere in all over the world .
with the help of a &quot; converted photo search &quot; you can see how far more information limits can be exceeded .
a converted photo search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the discussed picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed lot of private pages , platforms social media and community and national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , other attempts to un@@ mask the f@@ ake .
we have applied examples of the mis@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which , on which side they were published . thus , we want to monitor the range more clearly than by the language alone .
some examples of the most common use ( which in some cases were also connected with each other ) can be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can still be sp@@ ed completely ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the number of people on sites or server are still available on pages or server using the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or folders .
the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also f@@ ake @-@ samples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arab@@ s ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot;

this claim was made by a Greek factor check page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even in Nigeria the photo from DR Congo was divided as a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of a miss@@ ile use of the image from the DR Congo , with one of the twe@@ aks of the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand of a blog@@ gers , the alleg@@ ations that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , because the photos of which have been ab@@ ins@@ ulated .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a right position as &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create failure in Myanmar . &quot;
this fact that was published exclusively in English , includes references to counter@@ f@@ ake pictures of rum@@ ours that have H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extreme groups to declare that Muslims Budd@@ hist@@ s kill and ander@@ s@@ rum ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese national@@ ists ) .

this post , referring to the members of the Russian @-@ orthodo@@ x congregation , clari@@ fies that the picture of the DR Congo is not Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was granted in 2012 that Mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article has been updated in 2014 and the time of this publication is still included in the image .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 about students who had been murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic message page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image is not derived from the red@@ ness , but it claims to put it a &quot; similar d@@ ump@@ ic attack . &quot;
as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to oppos@@ e it .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Y@@ an@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ mar@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo is provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the stop on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
thus , they wanted to achieve these events that took place mut@@ ually in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams , a major interest in the name of the Is@@ l@@ ams .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was swe@@ pt as a cover to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were taken into no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise awareness to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do &apos;s attack .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was written supp@@ os@@ edly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , in circulation , discussions were illustrated like this in Vietnamese , and declared it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the embassy where the picture was included in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mart@@ os was dist@@ anced .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ ym@@ is also points out , but are no longer trac@@ e@@ ability : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / dat@@ est@@ amps exist on the cra@@ w@@ cra@@ wler and cover them about image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may finally see a correct description , but the original entry is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that pass through this post . the first frame focused on religion .
the photo was used as regards to major discussions about the silence in connection with ex@@ iting from Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - murder of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming is used to discuss how an African life is assessed by comparison to European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can &apos;t receive this images longer .
with social media there is enough people who have un@@ inten@@ tional content to comfort the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ars this atmosphere of the false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the real hor@@ ror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of for@@ ci@@ ble pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the res@@ sive of pictures of a ref@@ usal to detect the tragedy . sometimes these pictures even require of the victims itself .
at the same time the concern is that for@@ ci@@ ble pictures and spectators des@@ i@@ fying and to take away the ability to feel em@@ emp@@ ie ( such as this study , which sought how to help protect the for@@ ci@@ ble media ) .
while there are quite a lot of for@@ ci@@ ble represent@@ ations in the news media , fact , it is essential that they are indisp@@ ens@@ able for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists try to experiment with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will be thoroughly thought about the situation in which a picture would be something sug@@ ared , but actually replaced by the context or completely mis@@ used species .
any investigation into an investigation should be considered to be considered internationally they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uni@@ qu@@ eness of smaller languages
photos of Andy Simmons uses under CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ mist@@ re@@ able ) ende@@ av@@ oured to continue learning a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or ever to translate .
such words are in every language : they express a certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mist@@ re@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ unding esa ) .
but all resi@@ sts persistent in each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand what is meant by this one word .
this unique words have been collected for a full period of time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog one finds words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ba put yourself in recognition for your parents in recognition of how to settle for yourself in your younger years .
words used in H@@ uns@@ rik &apos;s language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , like :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kno@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the convenience or sl@@ oth , that it feels , after you war@@ ned in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his own words from his blog about :
they escape other cultures , un@@ veil other ideas and wake up our cur@@ i@@ osity .
sometimes , as we influence the world , we influence the world and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; un@@ mist@@ re@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treasure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are very appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is with the worst disaster disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka looks at the moment the worst flood and land@@ slides in that decade compared to the previous year .
triggered by the Mon@@ sun , who normally sets the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the shore .
according to a statement by Sri Lanka , on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing due to the floods and sl@@ ud@@ ge tours .
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 certain sites of residence .
the ra@@ ins were gradually withdrawn on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the floods are slow down in some areas .
health and hygiene requirements of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected area and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos have an impression of the dimension of the fl@@ ut@@ cat@@ astrophe :
high tide in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water volumes of up to 7,5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka deliver regular updates to flood water situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri L@@ ank@@ as dead@@ ly floods wor@@ ms the den@@ ial crisis , save the Children , after further ra@@ ids are already on their way .
this morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood at the flood , water level up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with g@@ all is floo@@ ded because of the Y@@ og@@ o@@ oda El@@ a .
the air force has five aircraft for rescue missions and five other five are made to transport disp@@ at@@ ched in their floo@@ ded villages throughout the villages .
several organisations and start@@ ups have also been declared to help .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
how appro@@ x@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour &apos;s gir@@ l@@ friend .
I trust my four year old daughter , who tru@@ sts in me their children , and she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we call for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ id we en@@ code rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of Um@@ bre@@ l@@ las and people , some hold the ic@@ onic picture of a woman with head cloth , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ an@@ ic par@@ ol@@ es against Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my gir@@ l@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this entertainment .
people who have been working or people who know me since years are separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the broad@@ ened concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has been in their idea .
they have for@@ ged me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all alike .
we pract@@ ising our religion different .
we identify us to be a Muslim but different art . but somehow we are all fitted into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective performance that as soon as Muslims who do not fit in there , be mus@@ cl@@ ed .
mus@@ cl@@ ed will be established
I don &apos;t stay alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures are coming in a sense when people th@@ inks about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I &apos;m now , he was a orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western event , Religion Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a major portion of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another part is found in the reduc@@ tive images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ized Western books already for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark men whom you should fear and the exotic woman whom you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid had dismant@@ led the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are still standing today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues .
I have been working for thirteen years in the News industry , and I have seen how this powerful Nar@@ rative Nar@@ rative s@@ wis@@ s domin@@ ate our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this Nar@@ rati@@ onal over@@ sh@@ adows the reality that during the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not choose their first female presidential dat@@ ors in 2016 .
this Nar@@ rati@@ onal failed to recogn@@ ise that when French , Muslim women will carry into public buildings , and acid @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which both are two sides of the same coin .
a mighty group exercised his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ onal weak@@ ens Muslim women to perform movements for change .
it looks at over it , that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought to slave with slave shi@@ fts .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ rati@@ onal has occupied our collective pre @-@ conception of art and faul@@ ty , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are often in@@ tim@@ ental attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the species we can tell them , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we can do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also make Nar@@ rative that help us understand the world .
and in fact , my industry is sh@@ atter@@ ed to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
and we are sh@@ aken here where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ins@@ ulated Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to immig@@ rants from the first generation that come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author was born in New York in 1976 .
use approved .
four decades ago my parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jew@@ ellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; Wol@@ k@@ eh@@ rat were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics by Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ ana Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan saw the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were innocent Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ fortun@@ ate Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me , why I say no pi@@ g of por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , I tell my hand hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ iefs , all Muslims at themselves - &quot; from respect before Pep@@ p@@ ah W@@ utz . &quot;
I sh@@ ear , we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ us with us .
we do not have to be the@@ the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and religious activists who try to fight widespread lies over the Islam .
these lies are produced in the current band of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ host@@ ility refin@@ ery with wal@@ ker , think tanks and experts for Fal@@ k information , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell us and because of the species we declare it , Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in more than just a fore@@ igner who breaks the head cloth .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly most diverse forms ri@@ p@@ ens our affili@@ ation .
it covers our identity , which is so far , so versatile and complex that it can be impossible to adapt to a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born in my pre @-@ creation force , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientist of religious lives describe it and look back on the following terms : believ@@ ing , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my gir@@ l@@ friend would look , my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the fire that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could see Mus@@ lim@@ a when they separate our houses through the 15 meter concrete and air .
she would see the sole rit@@ ual with my daughter if I wi@@ den them into my arms and you will protect the Arab verses to protect the Quran , and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called .
each of them repeated three times .
I pray you because they are protected from evil , the evil which you can see and evil that is not able to see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always a part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , join her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the picture of my grand@@ mother matern@@ al grand@@ parents with her sisters ; how to win a competition of floral artists in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of you that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , an old Su@@ fi saint , and a cor@@ ans with a lot of book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that they can virtually man@@ oeu@@ vre .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers that they had said to me , if I have a poor day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be , as she taught me to relate to God : Allah , what God means , my only lord .
for a people , which - over the centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; colony , which has founded a company with the name of hon@@ our@@ able British in@@ dem@@ in@@ ene Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men should not weep , but at the same time to see that my lord weeping has weeping .
interim in , while he writes books about modern Islam and over the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan is surrounded by his family in India , family that he could not close into its arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are million Kur@@ ds and Palestinian , whose families were torn apart from my grandfather , by colonial alists , which have shared the Muslim world as in the game risk .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that over the last two centuries , Europeans have to colonial all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the history was rejected over a century over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an in@@ humane , fas@@ cist Unter@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before the air@@ planes went , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

for my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion , deeply moved in our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means recall that 14 years ago , the world &apos;s most powerful military , with troops that were scattered across all the continent from Antar@@ c@@ tica to pursue mass destruction in Iraq .
it means to know that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ nings under the veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy comes home the US and the susp@@ ects bears a Muslim name , the story here is four times more reported as a story with a white attack .
it means to know that about ten hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a free black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that about two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ abad named Bil@@ ali Muhammad have been cl@@ av@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth which I walked when people over@@ crow@@ ded the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black lives .
an American woman being an American woman , a k@@ ash@@ ti , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , inher@@ ent the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity of our with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate them on other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ onal of the 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities than a wi@@ z@@ ch@@ ment , but will be represented in the reduction of two &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mother that means to ensure me to care of my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people were built on this branch of structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ sters that began with President Bush and have been stressed by President Obama .
it &apos;s in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immig@@ ration , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that covers its borders across from the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is an in@@ correct and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely the Arab@@ s and Muslims .
they are the wars which we lead and bombs that we cast down to Muslim countries .
because of the stories that we tell and of those who we don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University participants showed an scientifically verified image and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 as regards evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep to discuss the Muslim or the &quot; others &quot; .
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous expres@@ sive expres@@ sions , which we stopped in our news @-@ actions .
at least there is an increasing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , attempted to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the po@@ d@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Say som@@ e@@ thing by bush feed ; the vir@@ al video series Secret Li@@ ves of Gabriel ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to multiply Muslim authors , Muslim , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

coll@@ age of author .
but I &apos;m wor@@ ried about this difficult global time in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences , which go out over the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason for that con@@ spir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet now , now the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ ential because they made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has seen exp@@ on@@ ential by it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier she had not been given them ; now they have major areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and history , which I was not aware of being as old as I was so old as I was my daughter , but those who have made me today at an un@@ um@@ bled mus@@ lim@@ a .
things I have left like a bre@@ wing track in my speech .
things that are maybe remin@@ ders of memories , for in all the inter@@ actions which makes our humanity , likes a story where someone is made to another &quot; others . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia .
more than hundred graduates speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American mil@@ itar@@ ism . &quot;
but that &apos;s not a phr@@ ase that we usually throw ourselves in our schools or read it in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves , why ?
why do I count this here at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who led us to war as wars and people through the pro@@ filing of the &quot; others &quot; in public perception , four decades of Stan@@ ford was himself .
we have to ourselves un@@ comfortable questions on the role of this , deliber@@ ately and un@@ aware the &quot; others &quot; ; as did my love , and I did not imagine a new future , in which we had no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed people and &quot; too other mixed people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban diversity
history of history , Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way here and now in spite of a voice barrier with som@@ eb@@ ody in connection ?
for Steven Bird and Ro@@ by@@ n Perry , the founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is a possible answer to stories in their original language .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ known Blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get to obtain the language variety of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas , like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or Oak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not transferred to the children &apos;s nati@@ ves .
for the mapping of the project this :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities , do not forget di@@ ver@@ ity - safe spaces that they must not forget to be responsible for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is linked to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; listen , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , historical writers will initially set their history first in their own language and translate or explain it to English .
even if the participants are no professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion , and their images lead to it that the list@@ eners are on it .
they call laugh@@ ter and emotions rather than the language no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the history of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ates will also take the opportunity to clari@@ fy the typical customs of war .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak from the bun@@ ni@@ es and the p@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explained the importance of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to be an audience who does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide count@@ down he shares his feel of in@@ fos :
they have heard it !
they were very atten@@ tive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in contact to organ@@ ise their own history numbers .
Puerto Rico requests the state debt of the state debt
with the aim of a re@@ testing of public debts of Puerto Rico , who took to 72 million US dollars on the last 3 April 2017 , participating in the capit@@ ol of Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Au@@ dit@@ or@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Citi@@ zen ) for the ne@@ ural testing of debts ) and the National Assembly of Puerto R@@ os .
the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ mun@@ eration of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is your claim :
the people of Puerto R@@ os calls for the politicians , ben@@ ches and government agencies , responsible for debts to be taken into responsibility for their corruption .
we call for a financial examination and a tap committee without any personal interests to the public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration that deals in favor of business .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not its own .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be dis@@ able with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate measures .
the island - not into the state @-@ alliance of integrated territory of the United States - suffered under a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a reg@@ ained @-@ independent non @-@ profit organization with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law relating to state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto R@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
the measures imposed by the outside are without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens to be able to exp@@ ire by the people .
the demonstration took the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , support his supporters and members of the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he has paid for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference dedicated to digital culture that will be held in Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher that produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book published in the last year and has been licensed here , includes a range of essays that deal with free culture under the op@@ pression of op@@ pression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book would like to discuss how movements for freedom knowledge will be built and what are the true cost , which is associated with it .
activ@@ ist , artist , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working on site to view our news@@ fe@@ eds to create our news@@ fe@@ eds and create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunte@@ er , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information on his current state or position .
the introductory part of his book with the title College of Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that insi@@ sted on his release , and who want to know him back in his own life and in freedom .
to see how Basel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has let many of us start to thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , acts and decisions .
why Are We Here ?
what did we decide for ?
what do we have been abandoned in this process of tim@@ eless extreme belie@@ fs ?
the website for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been a government of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and attor@@ ney in N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command@@ ing the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who submitted themselves as in@@ sider the Assad government and replaced them with a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his position and condition will remain still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ le played a decisive role in which access to the Internet and to know how to expand the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and a moment of director of the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes have been predic@@ tive as the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ mark of numerous civilians and then mer@@ ging the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ian traditions and personal@@ ized influences .
Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would have everything that architecture , which does not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world .
this strip is created in the digital ar@@ che@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be open to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of un@@ estimated value .
Moreover , Bas@@ le could not close this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also has contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and teaching , teaching me to embr@@ ace them .
I &apos;m overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read English well , to write and to speak .
he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gateway to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also brought other in@@ ted , as they use computers , at least theoretical , without that they actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Warten auf ) , a branch office which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was found in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together a year along with the book .
she sailed his texts to him when she visited him and he translated them out of the Arab in English .
the book is licensed @-@ free .

here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens in every visit ,
that I will sing in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment , in which we embr@@ ac@@ ed us ,
that is no matter to me any of the haz@@ ards ,
each of the f@@ ences , bo@@ ilers and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the prison of the prison .
and I grin@@ d in every detail your voice and words
when I carry my passion for myself ,
if your eyes may say
and I will send another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to return all the moments ,

I felt myself that I will return soon ...

Bass@@ el &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , since the beginning of the protests in 2011 , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Ass@@ ads has disappeared for more than 65@@ ,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrian since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community announces the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today we repeat our claim in hope that we must do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption , Director was condemned to previous post by corruption .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with wrath on an corruption , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half his imprisonment in which the corruption was celebrated .
this is a model of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants with per@@ im@@ per@@ sion of 54 million met@@ ic@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money was made from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice became head of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guided tour and ordered immediately his return to the company what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , requ@@ est@@ ing the application , there was no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to re@@ ject its old post , as the company had completed no discipline procedure after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants are not hot in this promotion .
the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution which conven@@ es for public transparency , sentenced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle &apos;s decision to present the company &apos;s decision :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a return step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we have to know , that the company will have a discipline procedure against the infr@@ ing@@ ing market .
the company was silent , however , however , does not consider appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well as being contra@@ dic@@ ted in the case &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , it would be advis@@ er if he was condemned to a prison and has sent half of them .
he could have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating words , he could consult and pol@@ ishing his image .
but when he is in@@ competent , he accepted to be integrated into the company that he helped damage harm .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is to be paid for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil , the Director does not include any Mor@@ al :
Cam@@ ar@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he would not believe him , that one would reward you in such a way that the state has already been insul@@ ted so massive .
Cam@@ ar@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ally to return and to the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to minister to the state , but instead , only himself served the state .
cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand@@ ele in order to be an exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself is tired , the pre@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
hon@@ est@@ ly , I don &apos;t know why this man has been rewarded .
Franc@@ as Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief has been in prison :
th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but also as sharp as sharp as having said - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous verb@@ s , being ener@@ g@@ ically confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man could be anything , also the f@@ ather@@ land for his amb@@ itions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man change , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn away from his amb@@ itions .
an ambitious man is the same as a criminal act . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also bor@@ row@@ ed :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he was only 10 years old and came free .
and today it sets him the company , in which he rep@@ ented funds , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ pa@@ is - O@@ w himself ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored for many users .
the bur@@ ial word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or spar@@ aging .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their mail from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
even though the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or in general , as an ad@@ jective . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored up the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the same thing . ( in Bur@@ m@@ mes@@ o script ) as part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of Hass@@ elt in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the ascent of radical national@@ ist@@ ical movements has been given an extremely talented co@@ onn@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that usually used by Ultra @-@ national@@ ists as Hass@@ i for Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight Hass@@ elt in Myanmar , the company has focused a lot of meaning@@ ful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; might usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word is not displayed in Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that Post@@ s in which they discussed the use of the word or have doub@@ ts for the use of its use , have been cen@@ sored .
in addition there are several bur@@ ial words with different mean@@ ings that have the same accounting sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age @-@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cris@@ y A@@ ung Ka@@ ung has explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on the spiritual species if they could know how he could reduce his back pain by playing a voc@@ alist .
the sentence K@@ u la - &quot; healing &quot; ( K@@ u ) + the age word ( la ) relative to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ alls is the opinion that they must decrease in Hass@@ le of radical national@@ ists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic it , before it del@@ etes all postal addresses , which to spread rac@@ ism in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word .
the Autom@@ ati@@ c@@ ism will not understand what you are looking for Fac@@ ul@@ ook .
what it should do instead , the mail is carefully designed to analyse and check it by the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar Ht@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age @-@ aged ) .
the good thing is that these three sisters who hate speech @-@ wide , will receive a rather good lesson .
now it is at the time to pr@@ ism their national ism .
while the action can send a powerful signal to all , Hass@@ elt will feature any efficiency , the efficiency of this strategy is not long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of bu@@ cks often have a cat and mouse game , whereby the users &apos; social networking will simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook started to delete his post@@ ure when he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was atten@@ tive to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and me , the li@@ ken , post and sharing of contents for 24 hours , because the Post &quot; didn &apos;t talk to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Post@@ s from people , who have no negative inten@@ tions or those trying to show their opinions against Hass@@ elt ra@@ dic@@ ally national@@ ists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post is removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
post without Hass@@ ler from Facebook .
in the post the author divided his mind about why extreme national@@ ism and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believed that Facebook would have had more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community has to ask :
Facebook like a prosp@@ erous intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
such words to cen@@ sored version will only bring even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems , as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Buil@@ ders curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found that they made mist@@ akes , they tried not trying to resolve them .
if they would have only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits giving them a large turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ eb@@ ooks automatic Zen@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has made a lot of fun among users .
instead of serious taking it , users are aware of Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language , to see if their post@@ s are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Post@@ s , who were not Hass@@ elt , but nevertheless removed :
with permission is used .
the Bur@@ m@@ mes@@ an text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and add an Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
the Post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal men ? &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme national@@ istic ide@@ ologies and religious fundam@@ ent@@ alists , social networks have used to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt should additionally heat power in social networks , in addition to the communities in Myanmar , especially in the miss@@ ile of Rak@@ h@@ ine where strug@@ gles between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s were forced to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ized for his convic@@ tion that hate crimes against his bur@@ ese pages under control .
but rather than simply send the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have occurred better in context than in the context of concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned them from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago at the end of the Tob@@ ago
a wedding ring in the sand .

it is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously approved a law which should offer this practice , so that the marriage age is now at 18 .
in front of this change of the event , some members were taking du@@ istic and mus@@ li@@ stic religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group that had gathered the representative of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not be en@@ su@@ ed , since that , at age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contrac@@ ting partner to the UN Children &apos;s Rights , the minority is considered to be aged under the age of 18 .
the UN &apos;s statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 years , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago were 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s Statist@@ ical Office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 , confirmed more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that ende@@ av@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s to@@ e , followed at the feet and rejoiced great support . und@@ ou@@ bt@@ edly , they helped bring this result .
nevertheless not everything went perfectly .
a Hin@@ du guide , for example , had no concerns to say to the critic@@ ising of the children &apos;s grounds , they should be dam@@ ned even about her own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious Opposition sp@@ s for ten@@ sions in this actually rather complicated matters , and some doub@@ ts came up whether the opposition would vote at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s to@@ e - despite the 4 trans@@ formers ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would already make him a law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against the Children &apos;s Eve was approved by the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after he was agreed in the Senate , the draft can now be made to the law .
the majority of the social media user was thr@@ illed because the laws for children have been changed finally .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who was a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and un@@ necessary Ger@@ ede , which has swal@@ lowed up the core of the thing but you know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every price .
while Abel was the opinion , I definitely took long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was very happy that the day finally arrived :
public Status Quo news update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excellent news !
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ding Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil group that is right open , just as important to the adoption of the law , noted :
the age of married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft update was adopted today on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were committed against the law have approved the law .
children from Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # 8 .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations to you .
a Th@@ ank to our M@@ EP@@ s .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mah@@ ar@@ ap@@ h , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Bir@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
before months , Mah@@ ar@@ aj announced his intention to accept the judicial steps that the law should be passed , and he seems to redeem his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law said that it would be quite right when Mah@@ ar@@ aj was accused against the law , would be aware of the debate on the subject .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
sat , if we say , instead of the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we would say , that the state in our bedroom could say that they may not need to say , that they may have been mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ called men who would have been mis@@ used to carry out the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law , or not that legislation is an important step - but there are still locations in the world where the children are legal in different gra@@ dations , or still the norm , although there are laws that they are subject to .

using the mirrors on web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was deliber@@ ately presented on January 18 , 2012 to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright laws in the United States , globally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over one month , Turkey closed the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is clear how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series for@@ ges themselves against the blocking .
although many techniques of techni@@ c users are used to use blocking tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date articles from the New York Times reported that Turkey has not the third largest VPN em@@ ency of the world ) , if most unusual Wikipedia users fall not into this category .
although Turkey has been shut down by Wikipedia since 2008 , just as recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regularly since the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most important country in the world when it comes to massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains un@@ locked , there are now multiple Mir@@ r@@ or@@ Pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on whose de@@ centr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. , computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available in spite of the illegal prohibition .
in a Blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports on his efforts :
after having heard the messages ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we have set everything to push Snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org site .
IP@@ FS also showed that this stage was conducted independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only deals with screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the sperm .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sol@@ i of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ y@@ um@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ site of Wikipedia , as well as the Wik@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ sites when the country &apos;s respective country is blocked .
Con@@ sol@@ i reported sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as employees for Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Source speaks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a proxy server , a Mir@@ ror .
one gets to another URL , which is not the original . that &apos;s what you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially the server runs on the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself , if this is blocked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photography uses his camera to highlight the need for nature conservation
a che@@ er@@ r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos , which he looked around , never satisfied . they were missing with po@@ or@@ ly positi@@ onable moti@@ fs and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ated him itself a camera to wear and try to do the situation .
at that time he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ ar , has been working on the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown direct next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos of the attention of Nep@@ och@@ as wildlife world .
on Facebook , he described this first @-@ class situation in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested just at home when I called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan Lodge ) , when he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river bridge is just a few minutes from the tourist village of Sau@@ r@@ aha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to convert pictures to Kni@@ p@@ sen ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and would like to understand the understanding of that wild animals are not so fur@@ y , as they look like .
and he should know , because he stood by faces from face to face :
a tiger can not dis@@ rupt from the opinion of sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
even because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he is immediately right , we are looking forward to and he st@@ ats me through the s@@ al trees ! !
to encourage the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) to his photos .
however , its passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to catch at Bar@@ dia National Park &apos;s recordings . up to 12 days it took up until he could photograph a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .
see some of these photos below .

for the first time , Indian women occupy the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ ov and was originally posted on Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India there are women with greatest care , the names of their hus@@ bands , or even from older men to the family .
instead they use a p@@ onom@@ en or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ art@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s husband , as well as the fear of consequences , they should be the standard mis@@ erable , in practice this practice .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ gli@@ a by a guilty tribunal and re@@ fr@@ ying them by their family and the village community after having addressed a secret relationship with names .
the tradition of their wives are also not common to name , is also widespread under men . however , they have much less assign@@ ments to be feared when at all , they don &apos;t have to follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ ore , nine women , including health workers , and house@@ wives , with a unique club , were thus quickly to become the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , to whom they discuss the host@@ esses of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian States , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the community Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and is preparing for mining of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ c has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices , such as kinder@@ garten up to the union of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and heads this club .
she reports that these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made it at the same time at the ambass@@ adors of mur@@ al .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini shown in its discussion round , was the case of women who do not call their hus@@ bands in the name .
she decided on this subject because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves .
according to their hus@@ bands don &apos;t listen to the names of their hus@@ bands , it is a brilli@@ ance that they should be deb@@ ated and never challenged .
Roh@@ ini told :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a woman respec@@ ts her husband and wishes it a long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t last , is regarded as a key@@ word , as woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition has been so deeply ro@@ oted that we never have never thought to this discussion about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini wanted to have had her husband never before the name , tried to test at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother in law and my husband remained long after the video was at an end .
Prak@@ ash my husband , turned back to me , and said , I should call him yet by his name .
Roh@@ ini released its first discussion garden with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tested the discussion with a exercise in gear .
Roh@@ ini bat every participant in the name of their husband with different feelings - happy , off@@ end , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years , and this was the first day that they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ en in the village of Wal@@ he in Mah@@ ar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a century of centuries , in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
one woman was so sh@@ y , that during all the exercise , she was just before him ; another one decided to leave the whole fruit of fru@@ stration against him and his family by leaving him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ st@@ atically .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ k@@ ausch about it , with an ancient fires broke out , the women decided to try them at home to call their hus@@ bands in the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas put them into the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop his name .
another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law bore them , she was afraid , and told that it was an error .
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a group of participants was less serious and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported that women have tried to stop other practices , as for example , the trac@@ ing of the cin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point on the fore@@ head showing the mar@@ ital status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ red point , if he would do it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I heard it up to wear it .
the other women do not have it completely , but my , they are now in a better position , even to choose him on some days .
for many women , the dis@@ cus@@ pi@@ ds is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets .
&quot; we make a trip at each discussions speed .
normally we packed lun@@ ches and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to make women to make that what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes . they d@@ anced and s@@ angen and talked about things which they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , but I also have some things , for example , as our ident@@ ities are associated to our hus@@ bands , never as hon@@ est@@ ly spoken .
it feels great , certain things no@@ isy as they can say , absolutely no matter how small it occurs .
in a discussion of discussion , we have talking about the concept of honor and is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only been carried away in their marriage since their marriage .
for most is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a tro@@ users , they don &apos;t have drunk .
after a lot of war and discussion about the ex@@ cer@@ pts of their own clothing choice , the mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , W@@ ug@@ ger Roh@@ ini had her own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( shirt ) into a discussion round , so that women could carry her .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can bear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to make it easy .
on the question of whether in the five months has changed slightly since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things come slowly into the roll :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then we heard it back to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do not make it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two shall say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now contribute to each time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ head .
the women in the discussion group know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the fol@@ ds for greater freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by increasing each other , it will be aware that they sit in the same boot .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club is each of us the confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be an chain reaction if any woman being in the club home and other people are talking about what we talk and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

screenshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag had it . ( The Beatles @-@ commemorative day ) was found in the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans exchanged memories and share their appreci@@ ation for the Beatles .
the Beatles &apos;s visit to Japan in 1966 is considered a mit@@ ter in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who had inter@@ viewed exclusive interview in London in 1964 , will notice the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but this was enough to turn through the Japanese .
people here really became clear that they had no other choice when the Beatles received the open arms .
many well known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than only a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail promotions Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! the day is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan . it was 51 years ago , they were in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beatles have sung kar@@ aoke bars and taught at Japanese medium schools in English .
the Kit@@ sch from the Beatles survived all .
today it is a commemorative day .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should represent or not .
and how it belongs to fans , Japanese do not make pilgrimage to the known places that stand with the band in connection with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you love the Beatles , these are your 5 places you have to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages sometimes cannot be sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile enough :
good morning together .
today it is a commemorative day .
today , in 1966 , the Beatles came the first time to Japan .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
the same did we do last year .
and of course , some companies use the fans of companies as well @-@ market@@ able , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the day is Beatles Memorial Day .
so what could that be for a day ?
I &apos;m listening to &quot; Y@@ ES@@ TER@@ DA@@ Y &quot; and you can eat the pasta fil@@ let in Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day is going out .
so , we hope you are !
after this , the h@@ ash@@ tag would like to shine , in order to find out more about the Beatles Memorial Day .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of smooth persons for the Organ@@ izer , probably for super@@ v@@ ant purposes , presumably the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government called a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in Mil@@ ge district , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims were be@@ headed and had taken part of the organs .
two men were arrested and in the consequence they stood that the organs of Sh@@ am@@ ines in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
it &apos;s to the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a smooth man could bring gold or riches to bring the police force of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the objective of ex@@ ams for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that UN 2016 passed a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and invent@@ ors .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya dwells in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he war@@ ned those who have prepared to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are pro@@ cured men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are aiming of Moz@@ ambi@@ que attacks , war@@ ned the mos@@ ambi@@ que police after the latest ex@@ iting men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the ex@@ h@@ ort@@ ation were arrested .
H@@ uss@@ ene Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ burger in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said that local police have already looked after the case :
PR@@ M believes that the shr@@ ine are involved in the death of gl@@ atz@@ man males .
the persecution and killing of smooth individuals for the profit@@ ability and sale of their organs in the District of Mor@@ shr@@ ink@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , will indicate cultural moti@@ ves and will ende@@ av@@ our to exist to the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exist , according to which the victims were in mind to power the riches .
in the last days three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ ger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa that indicates that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty , Moz@@ ambi@@ que is opposite :
I would like to ask E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ ALL@@ Y , A country where people would like to ask for good notes , work and other achievements , a nation where people would not viol@@ ate their bread , a country in which the Al@@ bin@@ os isn &apos;t ch@@ ased out of a country or &quot; black magic &quot; to get the aim to get to quick wealth .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mourn over him , and speak our deep overnight stay against his family , his friends and all of them that knew him and loved it .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in it to expand the access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in the Arabic blog@@ ger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , bass@@ ist wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , she had been contacted by individuals who were self @-@ held as in@@ sider the Assad government .
they reported that her husband was condemned to death , but gave no more information .
Bass@@ els stay and the Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in future , we prove the treatment of Bas@@ sel as a pioneer of the Open Web @-@ Movement .
and we would like to put together the efforts of individuals and organisations that have been used for his release in the past five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , so the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those who were arrested or for@@ ged by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 not less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians are come to death , so the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has put attention in international community attention after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he has been hospit@@ alized because of liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State risk ) , after taking part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that led the democratic re@@ forms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; he says it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
in China , China continues to continue calls from the international community to allow Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out on the topic .
Hong Kong Free Press has collected some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Z@@ eid R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , hit the case at the end of June , to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a speaker , however , refused to comment if the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to make li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ø@@ r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway hit the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government reported that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations have only been continued in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement in order to record the exports to China , because exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news had common that Li@@ u was serious , the Nobel Peace Committee brought his hope to an expression and invited Li@@ u to catch his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize .
Li@@ u was represented during the ceremony by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was requested to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow medical support to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us on how it hur@@ ried in a statement on June 30 :
we also anticip@@ ate that China canc@@ els all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , they wish they would be able to communicate and able to communicate with the outside world .
United States
U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad decided that the Americans asked that he has the possibility to help treatment abroad if it be helpful to him in his satisfaction . &quot;
an spokes@@ person from the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message of the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u , but also his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia will free of house arrest .
the challenge of US Embassy moved a form@@ ative response from China to itself , with the appearance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no land has the right to have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to make answer of Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as travel sick@@ ness and access to the medical supply of his choice , to which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mercury and T@@ ed Cruz are also introduced a decision in the congress to push the Chinese government to push the Chinese government to un@@ loose Li@@ u and his wife un@@ conditi@@ onally .
I challenge China to un@@ conditi@@ onally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ conditi@@ onally , that he can adapt to a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u is &quot; all the medical support he needs to be &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking from the News agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could sh@@ allow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family .
Li@@ us advoc@@ ate declared AF@@ P who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital , and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells of :
Canada calls for China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to maintain and freedom for the exercise of these rights .
France
on 29 June , the French Foreign Ministry called China in a declaration of humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures have to be taken to make sure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family will have to contact him .
although the news broad@@ c@@ aster France Info told that the French government would be called Li@@ u in the country , announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that there is no further information that France may eventually take it .
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ land@@ ings in Taiwan called for China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and a greater tolerance towards those present to show peaceful funds to demand political re@@ forms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u would also called to allow China to treat the sick of intellectual li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed very careful in a statement on June 28 around Li@@ u and gave that many of them asked him to pray for Li@@ us well@@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took , and which he had been punished for which he had led to a harmon@@ ic , more stable and we@@ al@@ thy of China , which again had contributed to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Land ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question might seem stup@@ id since Singapore is recognized by international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a town .
this re@@ mark has caused a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting , on the occasion of a meeting of the State of the State of New York , the minister said that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
it under@@ support that Singapore should be considered to be a city .
... no one has asked if New York be a democracy ...
that is , with most people going to do an error .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to turn logic &quot; to defend the existing Author@@ ization of Power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifice , this valuable country is to create , we hear that we have no land .
it had so vul@@ gar , it had the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities , an compulsory infr@@ ing@@ ement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ on were not very Nobel : he def@@ ended up an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other &apos; ordinary countries , in view of that , he appeared un@@ dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago , San Francisco or New York City , equally equally in cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally .
as soon as you reach the core point of the subject again , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itative fe@@ eders will return to be the Democrats , abandoned the ver@@ ti@@ pped logic as it fits better to their power .
in the final result , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am we had given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our J@@ udi@@ ci@@ ative , our political system really not non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers rati@@ onal type .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am to clear his mind as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country belongs to our town ...
short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grat@@ eful if our new K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog his commentary he comments on the critics saying that you could start the entire address of the conference , so that you could understand the context of statements by Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the address .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; be as a country , &quot; he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ easy , even if we are looking forward to free and righteous elections .
he moved to Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win ? ) .
as he said that Singapore was no land , &quot; he obviously did not act in this sense !
cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , who as leader of a her@@ eto@@ fore @-@ growing generation , making such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am about what has said the Minister of Justice of Singapore , ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de that awaits me - could I not agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , Member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I doub@@ ts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes , really associated and is aware of what he is def@@ ended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review shred@@ ded the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am have committed an error , or was it a friend spokes@@ man ?
if Singapore is no country , we will only be regarded as independent and sover@@ eign state ?
if not , on which land go back the sover@@ eign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s equally land and city .
since he plays an important role in the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am are of severe significance .
why did the people aff@@ ord their military service , defend only their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our rosa Human D@@ ish ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
ten@@ ds the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the years , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition appears many points of becoming more expensive ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we are often saying that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country is especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should talk to the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ erable aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published as part of a current line , with rum@@ ours over certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the latest section of this series is written by Nev@@ is Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most likely to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m living from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on which situation it takes place , it is said to be pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ acting partners by asking personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication , the default response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many can@@ ans cook in front of rage , if they are kept for Americans , but does not distur@@ b me .
for som@@ eb@@ ody who doesn &apos;t know , there is a little that distingu@@ ishes us from Americans by Americans .
this is one of the reasons why many can@@ ans conquer a Canadian flag at their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
they all love Canadian .
Americans ... . .
so it was , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before entering the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian artists have always worn small ap@@ hor@@ n@@ als on their baggage to distingu@@ ish themselves of their American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gender marri@@ ages are already legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say obviously very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also applies to the toler@@ ant land compared to ethnic groups .
we are not as those types south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate it .
I took many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red .
it would make me nothing if you would like to switch to Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first to be considered &quot; nice &quot; to be considered to be &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be idle , but trag@@ ically un@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die Sim@@ p@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada is really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would be in fact a step forward . but the real problem exists , that &quot; cute &quot; has no character .
there is no corners and edges , nothing on which one can stum@@ ble .
harm@@ less , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn and earn no attention .
this can be some good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , starting from the things that pass around one .
I would even go as far as to say that the wish is free and only to be the main rule of the Canadian .
we tend to worry about our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ going as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadian talking not often over the fence with the neighbours .
us l@@ acks the warm heart@@ y , open kindness , which I &apos;m connected to my American friends .
fortunately , for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Canadian player are more than only &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has just made it sexy for sexy .
music video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ odi@@ ert in Thailand of Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous Pop @-@ Band has published a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ ert , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of her pro@@ claiming the civilian government , continues to reg@@ ained the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which his friend makes his gir@@ l@@ friend .
although not expressly polit@@ ically , the music video is indirectly rel@@ ates to the continued military su@@ prem@@ acy of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video was divided into Facebook with 1,@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists to view this video .
the video can interpre@@ t as a creative and entert@@ aining introduction into Thai policy , as it does it with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta reign .
take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political themes , which have continued Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the temporary Constitution , given to the Commander in Chief of the He@@ aler absolute decision on monetary policy issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ ori@@ ous programme for the &quot; Settings change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered as a critic .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law relating to computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to re@@ vit@@ alize activists and other criticism of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised the online content , and the persons accused of which the mon@@ archy is accused of having prosec@@ uted the mon@@ archy .
Thailand focuses on &quot; L@@ ese majority &quot; ( Maj@@ esty damage ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was declared war in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the j@@ unta is still pursu@@ ing , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , even though security experts they war@@ ned that the purchase is un@@ necessary and a merger of taxes .

the following article written by D@@ mit@@ ri stat@@ y@@ no@@ v , first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society re@@ covers slowly in Eastern Europe , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ an@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the carbon pool of Ab@@ sin@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ as@@ ies , Geor@@ gier and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today we live on the biggest part of Russians and ch@@ ases in the area .
such settlements are also called cl@@ as@@ ants in Ab@@ sin@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these cler@@ ics .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of more than 16,000 people had hardly increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls to him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk with you ? &quot; why ?
it is even clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable pup@@ ae buildings .
people who once lived in this place and resi@@ sted their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , now abandoned the district .
in the town of D@@ zh@@ an@@ tu@@ k@@ ha we live about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages that looks similar .
the Ch@@ ru@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which can accommodate one or two families , are recogni@@ zes on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they come back immediately .
&quot; our mother is forbidden to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us that is everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ per her gir@@ l@@ friend got something to and suddenly they left the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people are working in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence business ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ demand ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable construction .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the county administration delivers free candles and bread at the ham@@ lets in winter .

about ten years ago , an old woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left ab@@ dic@@ ts to live in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ sin@@ asia , &quot; she tells you .
Gal@@ ina would not want to accept any financial aid from her daughter and ende@@ av@@ our to support her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly rates are just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a sweet garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ unt G@@ alya told that they and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if we are , we visit us .
but we can not do this - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
when she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for a@@ unt G@@ auss on her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could build Zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen , but we will build Zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as inter@@ actions in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and his five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day they remin@@ is@@ cent of the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives of living in central rus@@ sia , Oss@@ et@@ ia and Georgia ( the Land Ab@@ sin@@ Asia did not turn away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ sin@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but this will even take a little while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as &apos;s kinder@@ garten was found once , they keep pigs , cows , h@@ uts and chick@@ ens .
it tells us that there was a very anxi@@ ous situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but during the time they lost their fears .

&quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people .
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has actually something to do with pl@@ ot@@ ings .
after the war there were hardly any work , and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day like the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation ended at the end , a little boy is gone by us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed house and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased after him .
he plays with the ball that rolls down the hill .
a group of children is now crying the ball .
while they run , some of them throw ones on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood which ensure indisp@@ ens@@ ity in their life .
they don &apos;t know different .

in Mexico &quot; m@@ om Africa &quot; immig@@ rants home to their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , near Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
this article by A@@ my Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org , and appears here with kind permission .
on the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican female , a small woman with an cor@@ als @-@ pink Brill@@ ante frame and golden coloured ear@@ stu@@ ds in t@@ ed@@ dy form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula . nevertheless they know many in the name of Mama .
this sur@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather they themselves ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has no no charm .
for approx . 2.50 euros the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with grinding , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the entrance hall there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are coming here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is telling people in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; m@@ om Africa !
where are you m@@ om Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cart@@ ons .
she wants to re@@ ject no one .
she helps them also and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medication that they could not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m which exhau@@ sted from the long voyage .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa is a reasonable sur@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebast@@ i@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a man &apos;s head ) posed with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Br@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly aff@@ ection@@ ately .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very well here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister , hopes to go to Boston where he will find her husband and the three children there .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , who are on the way to the United States , normally a first stop in South America and go to the North .
the family had heard from other signs of m@@ om Africa . &quot; m@@ om Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans have often travel the route and that Afri@@ kaner is already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his pione@@ ers , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest in M@@ um Africa since months . he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to sell the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s contact in the future .
&quot; m@@ om Africa is our mother and we never let it go , &quot; reply He is sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you that their guests will often send text message when they continued to gre@@ et them or tell her about their journey through the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
they don &apos;t know a lot about Africa , but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps known here , but it is not the only wireless hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a sl@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house .
he is Po@@ lic@@ eman and has found that the ticket to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
there are 25 people there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleeping on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ ery outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela states that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; says he . &quot; I experienced what they experienced .
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help others . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from a raid on his office in the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels across Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio C@@ ord@@ ova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to give him money , without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single one , has offered its roof .
a few months later the family lives and is still trying to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the gears , the trav@@ ellers get their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy about that her house is full but it is nost@@ alg@@ ically , because of them that go away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she bl@@ amed them in their album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ ids which you have made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
they laugh@@ ed sad , while she briefly presented them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Habla se fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring App on their mobile phones .
there is a check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users .
X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents , ethnic min@@ orities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification to install the District government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the communication is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allow access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , ò@@ ni@@ os use the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture were arrested because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police there was that the app retri@@ eve the sources and the distribution of terror@@ ists , along with &quot; illegal religious activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main feature is the blocking , por@@ no@@ graphic web site , of online fr@@ aud , Tro@@ users and Ph@@ ishing sites to give users to it , how much time they spend online , and to remote control the own home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote actors or even H@@ acker may be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly focusing on the experience of users in the major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote @-@ violent ethnic @-@ regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit to distur@@ b@@ ances and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities are often classified extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance activities , as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet tel@@ ev@@ ing .
this is based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; images from China &quot; ( which is mandatory ) , the zen@@ siert is published in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point where the occup@@ ants had checked the residents in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered using a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people to use .
this is a form of captivity by rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( the year ) has a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description from which emerged that the software can increase the data request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand shafts .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities and affili@@ ated affili@@ ated facilities including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office at the operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a Regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , representing her &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ eb@@ ooks , and media memory cards &quot; by the local police .
the intention is obviously able to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; but this promotion is viol@@ ated the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo taken by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ on ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the row of &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look forward to and you firmly that you are completely alone at one place , in which everything has disappeared .
everything has been dissolved after , dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one that makes her name all the glory .
a that caused me to feel in a list of feelings and ex@@ pressing , which does not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality starts again and you look behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the per@@ formers - transform the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and everything leads to death .
all doub@@ ts are in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the un@@ healing . you will clear that you have imprisoned between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have been arrested for me and my father three times , but this was not enough to create &quot; my lesson , &quot; like the chief of the Security Task Force - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he presented his power over us , by helping even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn out of peaceful events such as dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to destroy the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er .
all the bor@@ ough@@ s cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ain , for false time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is to reach the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ce .
in the third night the things had a little calm after the power supply in the quarter had ceased to work .
I broke the silence by saying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof cried out .
I heard my voice through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were bra@@ ve enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends brought to me . we delivered us to a gorgeous picture which complete my expectations and fulfilled it all .
in such a moment it is aware of you that you are free the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply interested in hearing .
I received a call from my father , &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low up - nothing can give you your voice , after you have done it all the way up to the office of security services from the body .
I joined there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men . my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me hear me as you are &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only bra@@ ve enough to cry when we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his eye filled eyes were set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are very proud of me to look in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did not do anything with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so secure with me when I answered : &quot; I haven &apos;t thought that you have never forgotten my voice yesterday .
and I think I never stopped to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regre@@ t a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary and his father , with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with it . &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this con@@ flu@@ ous movement lies in the nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a se@@ al@@ etic torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again by the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells .
I agree to me all the details before I cared for the room .
different than otherwise , they probably have been assigned to a larger cell in this time .
I have to share them with only one single prisoner , and may immediately drop me , without waiting for their permission .
after some minutes , like a whole life , the government left the cell , and I took back on a ro@@ ared communication method : beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my c@@ utt@@ ings was a &quot; cold det@@ ain@@ ee . &quot;
after a long f@@ itt@@ les , he eventually answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man middle age who sees me similar and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive fac@@ ades can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers networks an existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had covered me , they would be free when I stop him .
li@@ ar .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive all these cr@@ abs that lab@@ ored to the fruit in the garden of my head .
from afar off , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; at all .
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time , the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of Ver@@ der@@ b@@ ens is until I saw the yellow light which presented us the hor@@ ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Donn@@ er , &quot; playing on 13th S@@ ure of Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to listen to . &quot;
in order to protect the secret of state security : to protect the state security against us and prevent the betra@@ yers and the terror@@ ists in us they &apos;re talking to the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - thus they played their controversi@@ al sight card and missed the close eye view of their world view .
that is no house where there is no land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crime of their cl@@ ans to a hero .
I care about the inter@@ ro@@ asting and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the fac@@ ial expres@@ sions , who are still young , &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can join this day to join this day and join the demonstrations , so they will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it to answer me , not answer .
I can really tell exactly when not@@ ices and pun@@ ches after a friendly talk about me became a common communication .
when and what happened was was un@@ important .
any voice in me told me that I had to acc@@ am@@ per@@ ed me or when I had to be punished , though I had done nothing to make this sentence .
over penalty in all of its diversity .
his command is to rip off to me as much as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker re@@ vo@@ ke your cry .
give him a pleasure , you can not measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my cry made him not enough , so they f@@ aded the pipe through a cable .
during my first capture , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage @-@ collector or whether this was one of the normal working equipment .
they had four cables attached to each other , around us , from their point of view , to present great invention of a giant cab@@ s .
three of them are changed within a single lesson , while I was still in the series .
I had lost their feeling in my body - and also my voice so I stopped to cry out .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling and found no pleasure in the case , which is why he took the next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity through my whole body , enough to feed my whole quarter .
my half @-@ bare body that stretches out on the ground was the perfect power supply .
the dew van@@ ished and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
some hours passed that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning bet .
the door opens and the morning light meets the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of one exhau@@ sted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must make fear@@ ful wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and throw yourself , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had ever released .
where do they lead me ? !

he lives in the top of his family house , which had been in existence since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( approximately : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate active activity , which was transferred to the conservative majority and its old established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free opinion expressed by art and rap@@ es@@ music .
with his music , often spreading on issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian thunder@@ ing . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that go from Damascus to Syria until all of them in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is regarded as a man who is not restricted by limits , and he can feel the people with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he had not open it , he he@@ ats an extra le@@ aning against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones , anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian thunder@@ ing of the second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life of life , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sh@@ k@@ eth in water sol@@ uble Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , in that time it is ear@@ marked for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law says that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ tim@@ ely called young Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
fundam@@ entally , the mu@@ le lies dor@@ m coffee and the sh@@ wa@@ den of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries .
hence , it &apos;s easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to do not land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry Jord@@ anian citizens recently had to cancel his appearance at the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some par@@ liam@@ ents who support the Islamic State Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood , argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual acts Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contra@@ dic@@ ted the cultural and traditional standards of the country , and the main reason for the concert .
the members and former press spokes@@ man of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert &quot; had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the prison .
many also claim that the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab Spring , human rights and free opinion expressed in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m in which the old proven legitim@@ acy of the regime states in the whole region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a rated the j@@ ord@@ an people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply s@@ ne@@ sted Rh@@ et@@ or@@ ik , but in fact a clear out @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ine reality reflected in Jordan which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b resi@@ des traditional sex standards by helping out his vision of fate Arabic women to have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ fying sex .
the sk@@ el@@ eton shows the sk@@ el@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them who actually need to trust .
in Jordan , the number of &quot; honorary murder &quot; increased - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the number of honorary infrastructure came to their cli@@ max in 2016 ; however , Jordan &apos;s institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who tempted murder or domestic violence in order to maintain a reasonable way .
according to a law on the Cri@@ mean War in 1954 , women who are subjected to danger of in@@ hosp@@ itable violence , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for a long @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will nothing happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for that , not before themes , which have long as tab@@ oo together in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b insi@@ sts that his work is polit@@ ically , there is , however , that he is his music that is full of explicitly access to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression , not by politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I have tried politics , &quot; says he .
in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question after the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are polit@@ ically challenging in the core of the kernel .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the next course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a sort of market , in which one can get what you want &quot; - be faith or belief , h@@ etero@@ gen@@ eous or homosexu@@ ality .
it not@@ ices that barely any one speaks in Jordan over the rights of g@@ ay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality between L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + individuals yet have been strongly cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online programme Ro@@ ya , in order to be noted that his comments was torn out of the context and turned out into his mind .
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a revised version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that Int@@ ol@@ er@@ anz is not guilty of homosexu@@ als .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ ises , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ de that was to work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , in the eighth century , he could not write about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ i do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did not have to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the fas@@ cist kingdom there is nothing new to remember that the government attacks against free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be placed on silence .
even recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian News Service had taken several former government officials and members of the lec@@ tured association , with the reasons that they expressed themselves critical on comments in social media , causing problems faced with the deep in the country .
in view of what is the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the tip of the ic@@ eber@@ gs - the real challenge is to do a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ i .
for him , Pro@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos; L@@ eil@@ a has stopped for him for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - is that H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - is made of slow , deliber@@ ate and in@@ war@@ dly changes . it is sure that these changes take place in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arab@@ s , also from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions from abroad .
he do not only dreams , his work up to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region may att@@ aching the region using music , art and literature on a real and basic op@@ enn@@ ess - and not through bombs , stream@@ lined , and artificial way @-@ led dem@@ ocrac@@ ies . at least he hopes it .
until that time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will pass on and thus also resist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
this great , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the fog festival .
it is assumed that there is a version of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory clearly states that the troops come across from the west Japan &apos;s army in order to force the Indian population of the region , Em@@ ishi near to the kne@@ e .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to gra@@ b a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can imagine hard , how large these parts are ...
a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars have just been seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and even a breathtaking fashion to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched me the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high festival was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , because they help me to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from the crime of crime and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession as well as the Fr@@ iz@@ et .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us the most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historical centre of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ kes and illegal drugs are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population in this region will not feel safe .
at the same time in Peru - how many other intermediate and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services .
the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ s of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , has led to this more normal citizen to the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing , who can train this man@@ ger hair@@ s .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ dressing , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the hair@@ dressing of the hair@@ dresser &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts believe in order to show someone who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos to current competitions there is on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to create their weapons against hair@@ dressing dies and instead of bad advice about training in the hair@@ dressing salon that enables them to find work .
motiv@@ ated by this activity and the possibilities of bi@@ et@@ izing possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a profession , which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school beginning in March and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the bor@@ ough we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of love to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac

use with kind permission .
the following article is the published version of the contribution &quot; Liebes@@ kind to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ cio &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this article will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to humans who we know ?
is it not yet more important , people who feel right out , aff@@ ection for you ?
just this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ conc@@ ili@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged and writing Gu@@ err@@ illa &apos;s letters .
only recently , her country was a place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ illa &apos;s F@@ ARC ( german : revolutionary forces ) , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the signing of the peace agreement as it was so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Nobel Peace Prize .
but before Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way until they can talk about a real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa soldier who lived for many years in Il@@ legal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and contributed around the clock their weapons with themselves , must now re@@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian Society , which had acc@@ ust@@ omed to life in constant fear , and in some cases deep H@@ ass had acc@@ ust@@ omed to gu@@ ill@@ ers in some cases , they must now take into their ranks and support them up to build a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian will close together and help the integration process .
and exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people wrote letters written - love message to former Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ ters , to welcome them again in the company .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former Gu@@ err@@ illa soldier , who then will be handed out personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Campaign
the idea for reconciliation was made in the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Crist@@ ian was the possibility to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
it declared that we love the people who love to write from thousands of love letters , but those who forgot to need them much to need .
he has been telling this year to share his love with people who needed the ur@@ gent matters .
so the plan to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighter of the F@@ ARC , which now will find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought that someone would be forgiven .
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students at the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art re@@ ists to the camp to over@@ take the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC paid themselves on how they had done it earlier in order to meet the commands of their leader .
but this time they did not receive any prec@@ epts , but letters filled out of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between them , &quot; telling the policy programme Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighters led me by the camp of Gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I seen in one of the &quot; Cam@@ ouflage &quot; ( a kind of cabin , where the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ complic@@ ity live ) , I saw a Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ tation , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL pom@@ egran@@ ator , a dead@@ ly weapon in a th@@ orn n@@ ap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life has written me something so nice , so answer I them . &quot; then suddenly the tears run over the che@@ eks .
I remembered him , and set me beside the pom@@ egran@@ ines .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this kind , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mist@@ akes .
but now I know that there is a society without waiting for us with the open arms .
until now I have learned to circum@@ vent weapons with weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn a lot of things and work in dig@@ nity . &quot;
new voices
at the beginning of the pre@@ lu@@ de there were students and some leader of the F@@ ARC to a discussion group .
the students had grown up all up as already war and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret places .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC gave the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we experienced , as the social in@@ justice on the State of the State . now , where we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can help to create the society in this country .
for the aim of these magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people had never heard that they had never found hearing , and to know that people who have seen often as a monster and were even hated even only people with lovely feelings that were turned over by their environment and the environment was very painful for me .
the reality , where the country lives , hurt me .
but it was comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused to bring us a little , and give us a smile and a h@@ ug .
many former fighters have answered letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Es@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophesied that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would rule out .
but this is not the case .
as long as it is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to protest himself and to protest their rights . and that &apos;s also completely justified ( ... ) .
we now rely on the F@@ ARC on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what kind of race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise over all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , aff@@ ord our contribution and offer sacrifices , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , will im@@ min@@ ate many difficulties .
on our way it will give many obstacles , but we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of d@@ angers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ pressing .
with terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on a cl@@ onal reading over the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q municipality , isn &apos;t it possible on the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what happens in the republic .
over several months ago , the L@@ GB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after reports published the deteri@@ oration , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested the susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ verse , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there .
in her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they were grown , it became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for her , why she went to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced their house@@ wife , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life , she nour@@ ished her last du@@ des in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunte@@ er hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ verse that existed in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her when I thought it would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his t@@ ech@@ ens friends , with the following message : &quot; then , there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who can remove these shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents went through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ app round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing , a few grocery bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a mas@@ cul@@ ine saying : &quot; here is a gift to you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned back , I felt somewhat in my body , but me did nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time in the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honour the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and a@@ wo@@ ke last du@@ des in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had to get everything and began to cry out .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
at the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in whom the men or women have been laid ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there stands still my male name ; but the doctor re@@ lied , and laid me to women .
therefore I am very grat@@ eful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grat@@ eful to him that he respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got thre@@ ats .
they cried unto me , and they said , Stran@@ gers , stranger , some perfectly unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they exhibited ab@@ sur@@ d claims : some told me , I had to prove that I didn &apos;t raise my sex at the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and tell that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I &apos;ve got baskets size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family tries to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people said once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , that &apos;s not only your family , but the entire republic .
we can not touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
of my mother , it became too much and she put a stri@@ ck on the neck .
than@@ k@@ fully , the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with a dark windows and a number plate on a 95 .
after it happened for the third time I was clear that there was a little la@@ zy .
my Human Rights Friends tested the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to give its name , but I want to say that I am all remember ; they really helped me .
by her help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to phone my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registration , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered at a fore@@ igner .
I connected the SIM card to my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe you , just because you have left the country ?
our people know already in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number .
only to prove you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ s topic .
I still bear a few traditional Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements still in me .
so very much I wish I could not overcome this se@@ am barrier .
I always say that while my mother is alive , I will do my best to viol@@ ate it .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person out of their past - so remember my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for the long time I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to som@@ eb@@ ody who had a one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told , that during Ram@@ adan it was not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
in order to load them , they probably charge the relatives of this , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; was experienced by blood .
OC Media : are also still able to g@@ able men store in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be many .
if , especially those who have no range of relatives or those of their relatives have been dropped to imagine Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment .
as far as I know , they are listed there , so you can present them later as terror@@ ists .
say : should they be moved , they will show their body on TV and claim that they had attacked some village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these men were not just disappeared , but has not di@@ pped them to ra@@ dic@@ ally .
OC Media : is that now only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve just spent someone who was in@@ car@@ at one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there was nothing new of them since .
they simply have taken them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was even when people were taken away .
however , they have not been presented as band@@ its until now , there were no reports yet . we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why else could this man not be allowed to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wearing my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known throughout Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was alive there , and I never had problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria applied , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much more secure than now .
in Russia , however , Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; civil &quot; civil society , but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had d@@ yed lashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short pieces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the safety Ministry of Sh@@ aria never has a hair made of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me .
it was a small place where several banks had stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , there met .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a spe@@ ech@@ ing language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; sp@@ inning not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
one said it often to children , if it is fun of sick people .
OC Media : so just did you shut up their eyes before you because they believed , you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never been insul@@ ted , ch@@ ased and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace time last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long as Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about Mor@@ al in television .
he doesn &apos;t talk about us , but premature over the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who waited in advance , looked forward at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much .
apart from that , I still am active as activ@@ ist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ ed with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we perfectly organize Te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gathering together , I have to get them to hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t leave a p@@ enny .
I discovered these people , when I ab@@ st@@ acked them .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ de@@ an ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ way .
so , nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who prepar@@ es you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no sw@@ ing@@ ing at them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ians have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ iner who are Russians also ; on all the planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , therefore it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear .
I meet here so many men from Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - T@@ aking Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ram@@ adan it - live together with men .
do you know , many think of the sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love males , and they believe that men are changing his sex to make up more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ ant .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different hab@@ it settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry , I &apos;m doing so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ murder within the f@@ im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z Region has suffered from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the past months there is a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ den .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with approval .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August re@@ ate the des@@ per@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is dominated by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ ra@@ z area in the South West of Iran .
he suffered from anxi@@ ety , depression , and he cared for his own Hil@@ flo@@ od@@ ity that can come up for his family , such as Ah@@ mad Human Rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anonymous .
a YouTube shared video kept the moments after having ign@@ ited himself .
some people made it fast to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ h@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
local sources say the bur@@ ns were so strong that doctors could not do anything .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i minority , and activists say on the spot that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ mad Centre for Human Rights revealed that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah Mou@@ ss@@ awi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged himself .
their stories have a thing in common : everything was family v@@ ä@@ ter , who are due to persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ s and in@@ capable of continuing their families to feed and secure her safe work .
Arab Ah@@ mad az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment , discrimination
the region , which is located in the most part of Iran &apos;s Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i community , was sh@@ aken by a pro@@ found economic crisis , which makes it difficult to contest its native Arab population .
in front of a century , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took power over and in 1925 great efforts under@@ took to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
at the An@@ wa@@ z Region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the richest and precious usable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population gets just short of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disorders , hunger and emp@@ ties .
the Iranian regime denied the An@@ ah@@ az@@ i @-@ Arab@@ s systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dem@@ ons that are water from the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are lying .
dem@@ me have only led to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate under the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi yo@@ ungst@@ ers increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Irish Director General for Co@@ operative , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ is , which completed elementary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ry human rights activists in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ial eth@@ no@@ discrimination , &quot; a &quot; high rise , &quot; the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ mad men .
in fact , Ken@@ y@@ evi@@ i said that particularly the unemployment had become worse . due to this , it is a combination of a high number of ethnic people and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
as functional and institutions pre@@ fers non @-@ Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is to access the activity in all sectors .
that is part of a systematic policy of the prev@@ ailing regime that insi@@ sted on anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and to force her living outside of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their names and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ mad Ab@@ az@@ i , because even Arabian names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , sof@@ ten as the speaking of the Arab language or the tr@@ ages of Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i have to bear , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation will become explosive .
it remains to wait whether the world has w@@ akes up and notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not I identified the femin@@ ism with the femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of opinion , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . article was subject of several discussions where many different positions came to an expression .
you can read in the commentary below the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women , especially white women , who design@@ ate themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of movement .
they even thought well thought out scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , if it comes to do with their body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidem@@ ic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women or later , in diverse areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and belie@@ fs .
all of this is deliber@@ ately and known .
I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come on skin colour , on Black C@@ is women , on black tran@@ si@@ den@@ te women , on black women in the L@@ GB@@ TI@@ Q community , or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I say what kind of physical and verb@@ al women have been used , both in and outside of femin@@ ist movement , leaving many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they are all agree that women - all women have come together to gather &quot; their voices , and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing for equality ( some ) of women to achieve equality .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexual violence a institu@@ tional@@ ized form r@@ assi@@ mil@@ ated , there are black women to be exposed to two times .
or beyond that there are fewer women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and men more than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often be accounted for as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black sp@@ ans and women have been exposed to higher risk with migration background to suffer from domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand I want all men , all men , and all men , nor any skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot bring me as a black woman to take into account the white woman who refused to regard to their thinking as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhau@@ sted and I won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sphere who always turned over me and countless other black women and always rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In his speech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am no wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refused to just@@ ify a ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alized nature in the black woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refused to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb through cultural events of our customs and customs to describe their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not try to increase white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and sex . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them better .
although the Inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded in order to give wives of different approach and ren@@ ounce the femin@@ ism of femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer@@ re to leave me full and whole of femin@@ ism , join me and brought me to life of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , instead of using myself for a white femin@@ ist par@@ a@@ dig@@ m , which is so persistent that Inter@@ sec@@ tional@@ ity is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women in our own performances and give us into the sp@@ ans that are created for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana said : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we are returning to our own way , in which they are perfectly safe and hon@@ ors the spiritual , mental , se@@ di@@ cal , physical and even the spiritual elements you can make the black woman .
although some white and non @-@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures , because I existed in this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and for my existence as a wife as part of this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can g@@ low in an environment , in which my life wasn &apos;t survived , neither igno@@ red , nor yet rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ing against pollution : the mission of a man who protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , an magazine published in particular on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
this article will be re@@ published here within the framework of a content sharing agreement .
in the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a , in the past 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special arrival through the region Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to His church .
&quot; I wanted to do something of the river which we lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the n@@ aval organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ fall Alliance - who deals with it and to protect &quot; the rivers , streams and water paths in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia von Emil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary filmm@@ aker and multimedia journalist , filmed and published in Er@@ bil .
the emphasis on their work is followed , a little remarkable sub@@ cultures and distingu@@ ishes itself by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques that can tell their help to tell their stories in their way .
Paraguay Women and her difficult fight against violence
one group women depic@@ ts &quot; The weeping women &quot; to express their pain on the women of women in the country and in the region to express their ref@@ usal .

the following article is the shortened and working version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ dish . this article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # we@@ ili@@ ch@@ e@@ fr@@ au@@ am ) , who reports about the certainty of women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the affected persons .
a police Commissioner told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her dig@@ iti@@ an , who had been di@@ vis@@ aged against her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship has passed away and the police said , her statement would be laid to the files , but more could not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was revealed because of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , also the ac@@ claimed display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved back their ad .
to break the rate of violence against women , it is difficult .
once women att@@ aches at all once , they will not receive support for the State of State .
in many cases , women also be fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who do it abuse . this explains why only 20 % of all women who ad@@ mit to be victims of violence at all at the prosecution authorities .
content 1 and Statist@@ ical 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a Legal System , which does not under@@ take inf@@ am@@ per@@ t@@ 3 of the laws : good approach , lack of pun@@ ches and statistics
it is difficult to real@@ ise how many women are really abuse at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that indicate not even the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District Court of Public Prosecutor dropped 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . at 70 % it came to violence against women .
86 % of the displays at the police came by women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence at the peace courts . 86 % of the displays came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women found that they were physically abuse , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
this statistics show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister , Ana Bai@@ ard@@ i will also appear only a few of this criminal off@@ ences . &quot; to any woman who are im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay for mental mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who have re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed because of physical mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s lack of criminal off@@ ences in Paraguay cannot be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists attended at least 12 cases of women &apos;s presence in the country .
the coordinator for human rights documented in Paraguay , at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence against men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that does not take
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the permanent gir@@ l@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all their former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , yet , however , gave them . this should always regre@@ t it .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . however , she carried out the psych@@ ic violence against women and at the same time , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ z@@ able :
I never thought that I would have had a victim of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ement .
if I have read about it earlier , I thought that only women have happened to be subjected to violent men because they are violent .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ist and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and telling how he had ins@@ ulated it .
many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ isch , whether he ever had lifted up his hand against them , refused to ref@@ res@@ h his conduct as well as a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ern@@ ment .
other Facebook users surveyed in Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long from Carlos and not left him earlier .
it seemed almost like that they wanted to say that victims of abuse have had at least a certain fellow school .
Victoria Santos , which does not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner she was mist@@ re@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o @-@ CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I think you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all involved in any way of abuse .
in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences to listen to each other and join each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case , everything began with psychological abuse .
their we@@ al@@ thy partner was finally able to convince them to convince them .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tori@@ as displays in the authorities without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
it led a trial against their former partner who developed to become an unexpected judicial struggle between Paraguay and her native country , mainly by money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paraguay laws : good approach , defic@@ i@@ ent realisation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws , which are very well , but not applied .
the ad of Mis@@ sions is a path of resist@@ ors and fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , provides great problems on the application of the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ sten@@ cil ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ y@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Simple ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law be@@ ats to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to a stand alone pun@@ ish@@ ance and har@@ der as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legisl@@ ator has changed in some points to win the MPs to the Law that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are prohibited in Paraguay , to be punished by up to five years of imprisonment .
the original bill , intended to charge the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process , which have to bear the victims of violence themselves , if they would only need to refund and secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law was not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide adequate financial resources :
in Paraguay , abuse as part of human relationships is seen .
here a re@@ thinking must be held that violence is no longer regarded as a bit small .
he who lies in view of these facts is guilty and carries out that the perpet@@ rators enter the perpet@@ rators .
we need to refund so long ad@@ missions to mist@@ rust do not apply more than normal .
however , on 10 November 2016 , the Act was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage in cases of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ressor , to attack his victims .
the string of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered serious set@@ backs .

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continued to attacks
&quot; this website has been closed due to a decision of the information Minister , &quot; to read the Az@@ am@@ n website .
more than a year ago , the Italian authorities have closed an independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the Sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and returned to trial , later restored .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , when he came to power after he had instructed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , which had set off by one .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Central Bank .
the sult@@ ans rule is characterized by the har@@ sh efforts of security forces , in particular national fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , off@@ ences and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ ger , and other activists .
the authorities of peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights system@@ atically and encour@@ aging citizens , also activists , taking their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , her closing ceremony , and the imprisonment three of its editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom of the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) since its formation in 2007 , until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor of Che@@ es@@ d@@ ak@@ ter of Az@@ am@@ n , firmly issued in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 was issued an article entitled &quot; High Pri@@ ority Parties related to the Justice &quot; massacre . in this time it went to Cor@@ ruption in judicial authorities and the involvement of high @-@ level officials .
in the report , government officials were accused of raising the judge of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure , to lift up a verdict in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high ranking parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hands of the justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the editorial committee , was arrested in front of the Special Department and arrested by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was acting as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed at in@@ definitely after the information minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spreading of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first negoti@@ ation took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced to &quot; mis@@ use of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ation of the State of State . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience deal and found guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year @-@ old pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ an@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year jail and fine @-@ penalty of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after being used by the use of a information network to dis@@ sem@@ inate material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
on 22 August 2016 , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
on 26 December 2016 , the Court of Appeal in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j condemned to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in conjunction with his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he de@@ pri@@ des his sentence .
in addition , the Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of the Information Ministry , to conclu@@ de the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; .
in spite of the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks back as far as attacks by the Ottoman government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information was issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Foreign Affairs personally signed a further statement on which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was renewed for three additional months and giving the Minister for a further time against the decision of the Court of Appeal , to re@@ claim the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at most recent times the press freedom was viol@@ ated .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ communication
ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , image takes place with his image
medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addressed one of the most ur@@ gent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need of medi@@ ated medical research there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ culosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for expl@@ oring these diseases by pharmac@@ euticals are a big problem .
secon@@ dly , research , which is carried out by African scientists itself , is a major role of research capacities in Africa . major role of science and technology can only be promoting the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia just when the AIDS epidem@@ ic showed first major effects on the national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he investigated the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ pler healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia , and about mis@@ understanding of media about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnosis tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only put solutions to have been developed differently .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain the recipi@@ ent instead of the M@@ acher .
the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is impossible to use it here .
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , for financing and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research , which you didn &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory materials is expensive and it will take months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about Science and scientist in Africa ?
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students all ages .
there are demand for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ act@@ ating diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is a limited speed , things to do , and values access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited to the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change the world food production .
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine published on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding with the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ gorgeous , the first plant , cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , mort@@ ons has been working only through its own obj@@ ec@@ tivity and the question as many sor@@ ts of sor@@ ts can be set .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he could not yet use them for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ru@@ ff@@ led sheets .
over the last few years more such patents have been registered for more plants like cer@@ eal or cart@@ el . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts predi@@ ct food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , mort@@ on still continued let@@ tu@@ ce , however , however , it is longer necessary because his work is still more constra@@ ined by more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s been a rock bro@@ cade in a river around which I have to he@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we must do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; says he . &quot; I think that these patents go to Sal@@ ads .
and if it withstand court , no one can regul@@ ate a new sal@@ ads , because all the features are already pat@@ ched . &quot; he makes so good as possible and tries to recover the characteristics that he would like .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ av@@ oured to use a material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined one movement , which is always connected to the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the sor@@ ts of sor@@ ts and ate in the &quot; greenh@@ ouses &quot; of the station . there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather than sounds as it would come from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Sea Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software which allows alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and gen@@ ic are not protected as the intellectual property , and so it can be used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , shortly Oss@@ i , U.S. breeding ground can ple@@ dge that other people can be able to use them free for them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow you to cross your seeds , to cross it , and it will not compens@@ ate them - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
less outlook outlook
Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Oss@@ i board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants as well as for environmental protection .
seeds indicate that an role in major mer@@ ges such as biodiversity , rights of the pe@@ as@@ ants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to explo@@ it the latter , not only little as having bre@@ w@@ aged seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ izes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work on genet@@ ically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genet@@ ically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who would like to buy good examples of ecological agriculture or not . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably reproduci@@ ble vegetables , such as it is offered on pe@@ asant markets , should also know that the species is bred and threat@@ ens how this vegetables is bred .
nutritional sover@@ eign in no seed sover@@ eign is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source As@@ ed Initiative under@@ take to make other seed remains freely available . in contrast to this , you can be patented in contrast , seed and plant features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Oss@@ i supporters are argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is at risk , since the available enjoy@@ ment has always been available , because of becoming increasingly un@@ restricted intellectual property rights .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Oss@@ i , engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . it found out that about one @-@ third of all cart@@ ons might be protected as intellectual property , making it not even use@@ able for plant bre@@ eders either .
for other plants , there are such estimates yet not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by avo@@ ids that mass@@ aged plants are coated in size as wheat , as a salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ible
plants are grown so far@@ med that they have not desirable features - of such , which their taste or its colour increase up to such , because they th@@ ri@@ ve them in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents due to plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders are increasingly taking more patents . genetic diversity is currently more need@@ less than ever before , as the changing conditions are worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognize that genetic diversity was generally essential and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with all four cooperative banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture ministry of the United States , the company set itself for the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contra@@ dic@@ ts that intellectual property has other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ varied innovations . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ res .
often these statements help others to come with another method to come to the same result .
such a protection in@@ hib@@ its innovations not , but promotes and promotes more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent run strap , surely make no innovations .
and if you have to wait for such a long time , at plants , which have been adapted to the amended environmental conditions , one would have lost the fight .
the basic argument of Mort@@ on is that genetic resources always have already been a general good , and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ically an@@ ew are not attractive for us .
we want to make your work easier .
this is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
in total , Mort@@ on inter@@ fer@@ es with the concept to patented the plant features : &quot; we do not construct the characteristics .
the plants form them out and as a bre@@ eders we have no idea how the plants do it .
a Secret of Nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state , Oregon and Oss@@ i board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who are breeding , breeding also his own values in them .
who believes on industrial agriculture with big courts and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their growing areas of Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , who are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , there are most smaller seed companies to survive , even without patents - either re@@ ject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for in his breeding garden Sal@@ ata .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders by the Av@@ oid of plant pat@@ ent would be innovative : &quot; it looks as if I am dealing with my efforts to produce more than companies that are patented .
I need new material for my catalog as I know that my competitors will sell my sor@@ ts in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent is protected from the competition for 20 years , how to make it pretty simple . &quot; global reson@@ ance
indeed , the US seem to be leading the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept spreads very quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed producers . the center with farmers work together , helping them to satisfy new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell your own .
the German organisation Agreement on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately takes a formal and legally binding form of Oss@@ i @-@ obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding ) differ from country to land , as the Oss@@ i obligation cannot be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declares that the conventional plants could not be pat@@ enti@@ ally pat@@ rons . thus , they speak against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents to conventional plants .
however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States .
in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to find something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds movement and the world @-@ wide trend for beginners .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds systems that the organization is currently being able to build a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which should be scheduled for the scheduled year next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ens - an Verb@@ und from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , who will have the opportunity to exchange seed and improve on seed and improve the seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured with food products .
in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ized - a connection by the Lu@@ by von Oss@@ i hop@@ ing that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement of regional and ecological food has mostly seen , where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clear the people that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ est .
on the weekend at the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government shut down the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world .
in August , the network published a position on Facebook in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this stage , and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the same network for Human Rights Information remain in spite of this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution in the Arab world , so it was never as difficult to follow these goals , so it was even more important to overcome these goals , so it was not so important to overcome the blocking situation and do not ad@@ mit . we hope to meet our task further .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first tran@@ si@@ fied website of human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities began more than two months 21 websites , like the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ speaking network of Al Jaze@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1st Human Rights organization of the wave of wave trap for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading in Colombia and articles that he did not access the websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog , which he addressed to circum@@ vent the dem@@ ark apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of ag@@ gression .
blog@@ ger , which is home to the also called Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he reported on the students of security in December 2013 , while he reported about the students of protests and took a video like the police force physical violence against two students .
his article turn mainly to politics and the human rights of human rights in Egypt .
in a Facebook review , Zi@@ ada expressed the blocking of the government through the government and reflec@@ ting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs might not be meaning@@ ful for the world , so it is out of two reasons for me :
1 ) It is possible to give me the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , a temp@@ ter murder , fore@@ charge of the national Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs and any other website , for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only a small audience .
I also wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to get the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after having blocked him , and they are afraid of words , I can still edit the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ ff@@ ers go through the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities opened up from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . these include technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by converting Internet Internet Networks and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , 12 June , we discovered how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block and fil@@ tering contents on the Egyptian users may have access to fil@@ ming .
the situation is moreover wor@@ sen@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ ur@@ ns will be hit behind doors , so the Egyptian population has no legal basis because of which they can proceed in court against this actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro war ?
the inhabitants dispute .
the Brazilian army is in use in the Fav@@ ela in N@@ iter@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day a day report newspapers in Brazil with divided head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous Post@@ cards moti@@ fs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ plate sends 8500 soldiers of the army , the Navy and the Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an an@@ nex financial situation in 2017 the greenhouse gas reached the highest rate for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to access the United Nations .
reports such as these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
so , the newspaper article published for the detailed submission on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on August 16 the edit@@ or@@ article &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they announced to establish a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper stated that the newspaper stated that :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world , including murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual abuse , etc . everything , however , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to close journalists not to close our eyes from the grave .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper stated that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of the failure is :
extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper stated that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories , which will be controlled by criminal organizations .
in the edit@@ ep@@ ic article , the newspaper writes :
we know that a war dis@@ course when it is distor@@ ted , also the police may be used , all of the police , which do not delay and then ask questions to dec@@ eive .
but we defend the war , based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of Mafia and their partners .
sh@@ r the name &quot; War &quot; more than it used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , argu@@ ed that the violence covers a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult , responsible for the police to account .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio even - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment and a historical and self @-@ neg@@ lec@@ ting of public service .
reminder : the Rio de Janeiro state is bigger than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
no these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we watch the mor@@ als per state , Rio is at No.@@ 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , emphas@@ ises such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repeated the security policy of the State since years .
one of these safety policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Pacific fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a Fav@@ ela &apos;s massive police unit and to stationary a unit permanent there .
initially , this fact led to a decrease of for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP was intended to protect against vulner@@ abilities and repression against the poor communities that would actually protect the neo @-@ established police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux wrote from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the force in Rio does not comply with these criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification is in Rio as war also serious consequences for people after itself .
for this calls on the state to carry out the means and ways that are typical for war . it belongs to the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil is a sharp point in the countryside and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ keeper &quot; and &quot; ver@@ ir@@ ated balls &quot; becomes .
after the war or her , fact is that the residents of the fav@@ elas continue to suffer in Rio .
a week it is now that the police attacked the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ o@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident has also been striking : a fruit @-@ eller died following a sl@@ abs that had fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .

the region of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly strong affected by an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these reb@@ els controlled areas outside Damascus has stood under siege under siege , that caused a population to be poll@@ uted or slaughtered by tunnel and control points .
through the years block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics has taught the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can create their own fung@@ us as a life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ near and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
the mushrooms are not among the conventional , in Syria , vegetable food and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . her nutritional value is however , however , at an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct line of the project , subscription Nab@@ il , said to the French News Agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to flesh , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , this project is well @-@ known and op@@ pressed his relief from that it is now more and more . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ as , the humanitarian co @-@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as .
it is planned to mediate 125 families of knowledge to produce mushrooms , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a too Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue until Monday , 4th September 2017 , continues to gather on Can@@ Do .
the initiative is based on generators which maintain temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
locally produced fuel materials from plastics are used because of the fuel scar@@ city , in order to supply alter@@ nat@@ ors with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of regions in the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality , and whether they are not suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when they succeeded , they used a large v@@ at . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; training yard for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in the east of Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to kill the mushroom for@@ n@@ ication of various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
distribution of a culture of self catering , producing food resi@@ dues ( like paper , tea , coffee set , box , etc ) for the recovery of new food .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires from 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ants on October 21st in many districts in Portugal and demanded by justice for the victims of the fires that were gr@@ illed in the week before that in the north of Portugal .
two and forty people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire urch@@ ins belonging to the country &apos;s northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Forest Monitoring System , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recordings , only 500,000 acres of forest will be burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the surprising tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the Civil Protection was not able to ha@@ ze the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ al from the Federation of the farmers from Portugal declared newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated to everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this no@@ where : there are dozens of open streets , which were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , because the streets were very late . &quot;
in addition , construction permits in furn@@ aces with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko are question@@ ed .
an extensive proposal to the roll form , which the government had brought to severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was taken by the commun@@ es which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; the government introduced a disin@@ teg@@ ration of the law that allowed the construction activity on means of self @-@ protection . this was an open rear door that could be built , João Sor@@ val continued in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the cross organization Quer@@ cus did attention to attention that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ ypt@@ us trees , trees from slightly combust@@ ible wood , themselves , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ate , after Br@@ uses this species always spread out .
to these problems , it adds that the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October when people sought or tried to contact persons , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information provided with the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and inform@@ al the population in real time over the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of fire brig@@ ade and was eliminated at this fat@@ eful weekend in October so much that the servers have been pursued by the 400,000 users , that the site counted over a half a million .

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs

during a night in the fall of 1994 the Taliban kick@@ ed off through the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in @-@ group@@ ings that defeated the short @-@ lived per @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ ha@@ zn@@ i in Central Ghana for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother didn &apos;t know it then , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break .
his un@@ cle would fet@@ ch him and bring it to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was murdered by the Taliban , and many haz@@ ards felt safe .
the Taliban came closer to their hat@@ red on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara leaving the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
some days after its run , A@@ shar@@ af found themselves in Pakistan again .
he worked in a coh@@ er@@ ru@@ be for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wage and went into Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing sacks with mort@@ ar who were heavier than he himself to earn his life .
at that time , the life of Afghan refugees caught fire and exploitation in Iran .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; rec@@ en in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan Refu@@ ge@@ es ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked on .
there were no services there and no heating . we joined the open window in front of the open window , so that we do not sleep at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af lost his life without the pap@@ ers in Iran and went up for the journey to Europe .
at the dangerous journey to the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome alone and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to support needy .
in fact , Italy is true that Italy is relatively high level of ir@@ relevant asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions that apply asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astroph@@ ic .
the human rights organisation of the Civil Code in Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special recording centers . they dealt with impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a recording center , if they have officially put an application for asylum , which may go for months after registration of the asylum seek@@ er .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation have to be paid either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it went to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his fierce life , A@@ shar@@ af helped quickly to liber@@ ate these conditions .
after having made several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had gained his total savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that it opened after a while another hostel opened a second hostel .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now the theme of &quot; handic@@ apped Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
many bureaucr@@ acy , high taxes and conditions for credits are just a few of obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20.000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afghanistan are created by Afghanistan , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were blessed in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurants is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua up the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the p@@ izzeria Kab@@ ul@@ og@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome are also Afghanistan .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ y industries and the retail industry , and aims to qu@@ it back to the country that he had to forced to leave as teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , are ways of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can not live , if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and you have to get the same possibilities as all the others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also sp@@ ans plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , in which the people may sell packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; so they can improve their losses on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot;
the development of successful entrepren@@ eurs was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he would like to help another Afgh@@ ans on this road .

the Egyptian parliament has checks out a bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after signing up with a government authority .
users must use the social networks to use social networks within six months of the official legislative process of the website under indication of its complete name and the sign @-@ number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or payment of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was given by sixty @-@ members of parliament , is currently the processing committee as well as the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the deputy was accused of being introduced to har@@ der for the har@@ dening of the president or high officials .
under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of president and state facilities will already be pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the bill , such a @-@ such deed would be off@@ ended with prison and fin@@ es , as just@@ ification of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the Act shall be passed , this will represent up to three years imprisonment for the convicted .
in addition , this would have a political climate , where the right to free expression of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Sub@@ scription ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , who demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who had led to the authority of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as there were more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested by the same incident , four years in jail for one verdict .
recently , his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison line according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused of prison in the Court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the penalty of death as a result , so many human rights violations are inv@@ aded , Il@@ legal Assembly , murder and su@@ su@@ al murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza said two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ es@@ ian activists to listen to the documents
May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the hearing of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia suffered mainly to a forgotten plan of action . according to the plan expressly a controversi@@ al bill was supported by the business@@ man and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Ab@@ id@@ ine Ben Ali of corruption , provided this all un@@ just@@ ly preserved money .
the document published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , th@@ rows a light to look like the Presi@@ dential plans to support the legisl@@ ature .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia ruled the separation of his sources by article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press house which as@@ sures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 May as a witness in the case .
will China forcing social media to take advantage of their identity ?
according to the new regulations of the People &apos;s Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media require a approval before they write messages in social media or share .
in the provisions , it is also indicated that the registration will be required by the full name .
analy@@ tics assume that this is to be achieved by elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in convers@@ ations within social networks , however , it is un@@ clear how authorities will apply these regulations .
according to the social media , Chinese citizens are proposed to en@@ force these regulations only selective in order to protect journ@@ alism and independence .
then we see in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?

according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat should register as &quot; organizer of the information distribution &quot; in the state government .
this name is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to the Russian government leading a list of online services that also allows the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of contents and to force them on request for the compensation of user data .
these websites include web pages such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ c@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
