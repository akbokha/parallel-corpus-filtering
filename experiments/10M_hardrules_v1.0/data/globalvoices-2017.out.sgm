<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have read and operated American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a derarest profound effect on me, that I was mainly because of a US film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Gartham in The Pelican letter, a fearful reporter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Studying, who had the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming, that you are always the fact that you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had written a very warm love letter to his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow face.</seg>
<seg id="15">He holds his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he expressed like a former colleague, and declared publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people were responding to his statements and approved in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican Presidential elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans that support those certified person, do I ask myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not take Trump and his electors not to people in harmony with people during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, I was Professor Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist, the people from around the world, a deep unbeliever, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">The "Cincinnati Inquirer," this was also backed by Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," in agreement.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the Phoenix Suns' at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intoleranz is also reflected in contrast to the generosity which I struggled with Sandy Bahr that fights for life in the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and help my colleagues to get us at the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my Mentors, whose wiser advice helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and they were scattered by them my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">During his way back to the republican presidential candidate, she baked me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it was obvious that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggles with the idea that people voted for Trump because they were either having racism and fanaticism because they were ready to oversee these things, almost the heart broke me.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair the Trump-voters as a cassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people are classified, said one of my friends, is exactly what led to us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and thinking.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters are, of which most are white, voted for Trump, because they want to recover the control over a country, which they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick that commented upon the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Om.): as much as "Rejection of the White against all other ethnicities," The eyes from white in play to the White and whipping ash, which means that great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Million people around the world appreciate the American Ideal - no matter whether myth or reality is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America means everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land was elected as his president, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose story, as he himself says, where else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the White's promise has grown up and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and all the concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas, after 9 / 11, the white man again say on the ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all these things I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration of Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, had my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, has a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud sound "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"Muslims had any position in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" müled the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos take a seat in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, has a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He got an impressive and silent "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan ended with the words: "God is thanksgiving, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both locations, not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among the tourists, but worlds away from the nearby precolonial ruins and of its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now the La Banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: one of children and adults existing symphony orchestra, which with their musical instruments have found a way to overcome them surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A school with 100 students is become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest of the Mexican provinces of Mexico, is known for their abuse and misuse.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot that started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI said:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of the school, they walk back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dusty streets to follow their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always lachend and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you day for Tag trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the kids of Cateura - a village which is practically above the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay, on instruments which are produced from restored waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments, which consist of local hard waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of the seperes into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, frying, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all produced from the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music and music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez remembers a local ecologist and musician teachers of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsing and we had to teach at the same place because the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a out of trash produced.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recovered material and is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary" "" "Landing Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates around one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Surveying harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These Eastern African countries show how technology and team work will fight the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights against pirates fisheries.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that has been specifically reported for international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The realization takes place within the scope of an agreement with Global Voices to joint use of Content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The Eastern African countries were correspondingly brought into this form and a bit inclined, a Legislative Decree of this kind to its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique, and Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to accept one of their harbours and refused to divide it a fishing boat.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that simply denied all these things," "" "Kiilu, a conductive employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship in the time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it didn't manage to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The nucleus of this initiative that protects criminal practices and resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">Members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that the Premier had driven out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are issing and working together. you can find themselves and stand on each other where it goes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is defined by definition. is hidden, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to wear because of it, the illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, during the actions against illegally fisheries were once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles, and with the information between different countries, the actions occur in real-time, with tracking at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries may exchange lists of existing licences, news to suspect activities or details that could possibly be noticed or experienced during an harbour view.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursued the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables to mark the authorities to mark ships which fish in forbidden areas - such as suspect driving conditions - such that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and eventually whether they have a criminal offender.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing catch can be found on the basis of these information so that the ships may not be able to sell their cargo. and that they even could not be forced to numbers of penalties as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there's significant financial losses for the owners, meaning that the illegal fishing catch is financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And this is what we want to reach, "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that assists in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already known platform was created to have lost 20 million USD to lost sales. the eight members of the network HISH-i lose each year because of the illegal fishermen, which penetrate in Eastern african waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fish plants, which attracts commercial fish-fishing from around the world. under these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">To whose practices include actions count as the sailing under false flag, fake licenpaper, specifying imaginations, fish protected species and the fish in nature areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use the lack of international cooperation and take the weaknesses of a non-organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "he could not say a ship illegal and a country could say 'You're not able to run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. "and exactly this sampler Schlupfloch attempts to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its founding, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has corrupted the criminal offences in Tanzania, the counterfake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it worries ships and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight of crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the work of organizing crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system to help FISH-i to be suspected of several ships in precise ships.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be enhanced, helps you to hide the illegal tracked ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NRO who also offers fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems where they can no longer be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects various information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually take influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch along with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "wanna accumulate with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who doesn't do what makes sense" "" "says he." "" "here is a chance for countries to unify and to bundle their resources for research." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts must run a similar project with which a global system will harm the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but also retrieving them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously exploited without license and would hardly believe with consequences, you know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile been a 33% rise of fishing sales, ever since fisheries are able to purchase more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia were helping out Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board locks, whose usage is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also noticed these successes. "the effect is so strong that now other countries have become," says Kiilu. "we are one study project." in West Africa, we disappear several hundred million dollars due to illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. even they fight against the same model as FISH-i. "With safety, the aim is to create more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member country had its first major triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without license and were not allowed to be forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also used in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the action of measurement against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against pirated fishing." says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time, proof that such special, collaborative work is actually working in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview recorded by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, as the origin was published on August 23, 2016 to Día a Día, an Argentine news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, Quijano said well, in the course of the great La Perla-Ribera trial, in the province of Córdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were committed.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not sought his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the brush, same name as his father contribute to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept his family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age do not notice that it is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I was not able to recognize that my father was a thief, Folder and robbers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was his father Luis Alberto Quijano. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy chief of the intelligence service 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archival intake.</seg>
<seg id="212">However, this is not the history of Luis Quijano, the oppressed that is charged for kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities which he had experienced as a boy in the course of years, and who testified before a court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">Its history shows what great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the Sports Hall to the Military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to pick me up to the military base, I often went to the Sports Hall. there I had a boy with a boy that was fighting for martial sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an arousy, you have completed yourself with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they have not left you one day, and I will save you.</seg>

<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small, wrapped up in a blanket and ordered me to wear it into the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On this day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were removed and kept myself with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open room and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in, and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they were fixed at the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just fastened up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They drove a man with handcuffs to the bed, overshot him with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts into the genitalia.</seg>

<seg id="244">When my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked me: how is it possible that a man can do so much evil?</seg>

<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses, on which naked people were under the face down - all were bound in hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="257">I know this because my father told her home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were classified as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there, killing a man.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process of human beings.</seg>

<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea of what the "war spoils" - as they called it.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military, I was in the Gendarmerie - it was clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps military police, which one has fought against the enemy.</seg>

<seg id="279">Once he called me a crime and I answered: and you, who descend on the road?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are no crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded before rage, struck me and cried:</seg>

<seg id="344">The shield with the translation error to a center in KYOU can be extended in which one can extend his license.</seg>

<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers have been a newly opened centre in which one can extend his license, in the last month witnesses of a very special translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">In one shield, the Japanese word (coincidence of sha), which means "older motorists" means, feitful - maybe even with a great rear-behind & # 8212; "a fearful motorists" translated.</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance and building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was divided into the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun published in KYOU:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to so an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult of elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable, "said Holmes.</seg>
<seg id="356">The defective English translation was removed first. the designation "The drivers" (german: "fearful drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammage was not the correct name "Elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The prefecture of the Kyoto prefecture are precluded for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text, and that the translation was not tested for their correctness before it was released.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported how follows the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we're sorry that elderly people were insulted by the inadequate correction (the translation)," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news dienst J-Cast News set up something detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was made as an unreasonable description of elderly car drivers. according to the police there are the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents throughout the country, but are absolutely reason to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture of Kyoto, in 2005 1.941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, Seniors killed 1,803 from a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This puts its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of seniors caused by the same period has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The namefully called reporter brought comments on the published version of the article, comments on light which show that predators some Japanese seemingly ask for older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo over the translation error received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" fearful drivers ") about reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">- "so bad is the translation actually not, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="370">"" "" "" "I don't think that this is a real translation error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="371">There aren't few such comments.</seg>
<seg id="372">Why "Engraish" is spread throughout Asia</seg>
<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation defects are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important capabilities: passive voice skills to understand and active language skills to understand and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active rule of target language - a little while native speakers in the case. generally, the persuasion that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - mother tongue.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French mother tongue was to be translated from English to French - not from the French in English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese enterprises do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue that might have translation into English. this may be a lack of understanding to translate, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers, Japanese to learn.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who have no foreign employees have made translations, but then the Japanese staff, whose English know become the best estimated to have been translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really good.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and avengined propositions which arise through mechanical translations, show that this technique might not yet replace a human translators. this applies especially for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English forgings in Japan, including the avebral prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like ornaments still acceptable or at least harmless. but by major companies or from the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto utilizes a serial source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, changes from Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliament debated recently a bill to "the regulation of usage and uses social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If it is assumed to be accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt to government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a site would then be set up to share issues of citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the acceptance of the law, users need to register their users on the site of the site with their correct name and personalized numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this is missed to do this, it may bring out a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six parrots and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs on the Internet and communicating with others by voice, video content and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed when the law is being accepted, since the draft is not supposed to enlightened the user's usefulness and users who do not register for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Rahar, parliamentary member and the promoter of the law, reported the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users, and users received a user name and a password from the Telecommunications Ministry, to enter the Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a firewall around Facebook. due to those, it would need to be necessary for Egyptian and Egyptians, information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known so far that such projects exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the pre-slags.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for personal rights"), explained Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt one of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">My opinion, they imagine that, as it could be used for forcible physical public and private spaces, it may also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I accept them, then it means that it will need to be a powerful monitoring system to provide a permit or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the human being and to bring them to a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not so realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">In order to be adopted as a law, the draft version must initially be discussed at the legislature of Parliament and the Constitutional Committees, before it comes in the plenary debate.</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the design "is in line with a pro-military thinking in parliament, in whose sense, control is supposed to be maximized and assured that no deviating Narration is present on the screen area," says Rao..</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "Peraza is the only remaining predatory in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of the ecosystem, also depends on that a big catfish is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards actually in the free wild, is small and goes against zero. as the team is therefore fixed that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, Raza stopped in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shenno is documented in the north-east Japan daily Kahoku Shenno, which were affected by the life of them in the last six years. an enormous earthquake, an tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima happened.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shenno Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai which is in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a permanent prefectures in Japan, which both experienced the earthquake and resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbors between Fukushima and Iwate were forced, because the tsunami had to disappear entire coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even though the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report from the Kahoku Shenno shows from local viewpoint that progress reached six years later to rebuild the life of local domiciration.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (Ever., saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Likewise, there are still six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsu (Ever., kasetsu juutaku) to be moved to final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency, whereas more than 75 percent of the evacuated who were sheltered after the desaster in accommodation, have been transferred to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwah the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of works and everyday life in the three most affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, have opened its doors to the end of December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it says that industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">Whereas almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now returned to operation in Fukushima, only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident in the three prefectures agricultural land have moved large-surface in mitigation.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of the cultivated fields of Fukushima happened in the nuclear zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered well again, but also Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">Tourist taxpayers in Miyagi and Iwrestate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima happened here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shenno Newspaper also reports that almost half of the coastal towns, it is more difficult to earn their habitable.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared on the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total image, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuation. she asked them about the stand of reconstruction and even as their indignation has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shenno led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough in catastrophes have been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who were evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shenno-Zeitung has strengthened its attention, also on the location of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima also had been a witness of the worst, catastrophic accident, amongst the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to the prefecture of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were somewhat more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima living outside of their home-prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated areas are still standing in tourist accommodation, because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. they are building projects, which are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, had suffered a skull-brain trauma and several freaks.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors established him this Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spread quickly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the face of the police officer, recognizable with a stroke attack. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio had been suspended until the examination of the incident recorded by active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, such as he performs in Goiânia with his headstock on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer must be checked by a demonstrators and placed on the intensive care unit, his face would be visible for six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Despensalizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, distributed the video on the grid, where you can see how Mateus is attacked by police officers and several sanitation soon to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip, one sees the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, living in another country, Internet uses 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,700 euros) in order to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and allow to stay in Goiânia during his family.</seg>

<seg id="612">Professor Pablo Ortisado is calling for additional nonviolence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experienced a wave of political power: here, the activist Guilherme had been murdered by his father, because he was attacked as a deserted school of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has attacked the very sad case, after he attacked from a policemen who struck him with a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police transmissions</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it arrived from police operations against demonstrators in the last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were set up in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for speakers, rubbers and tränengas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The deputies of Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL) asked the police to abstain against demonstrators against demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report written in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media is inspired by the Brazilian media, pointing a focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported a well-broken glass windows in order to create a photo of the title of photography.</seg>
<seg id="621">In contrast, the O Globo delivered a title story with a set in fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason, more about a broken window disc than the protests thousands of people who serve the defense of a special matter.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognizable if you strive against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here, the term "vandalism" is a absurd, disproportionate, and the typical nonviolence of the military police are disguised by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontational course with the police".</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane fabrication in all of Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Church Liberal Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - on Spanish Sugar ühle, regardless of what there is no significant loss of sugar levels.</seg>
<seg id="628">It's two years ago, when the activities were manufactured in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the erection of the sugar cane industry in the region, and the factory lost after and after his facilities, until only the rumor of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuels daily to the factories which are still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a solo veteran, who opens every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that it was in the east of the sugar cane factories, which are in operation after long inactive time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something what he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of the fact that Mañali would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resistance already the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market price, the inefficiency, the poor administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country for some decades, but the bad harvesting are already no rety.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway path of the congregation saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane fabrication were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive, they were intragically for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the Sugar Crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar prices rose again about one decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">Between 2017 and 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food-Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), raw sugar imports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything worked well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's Day is going to go down in history," the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro, during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane fabrication came out, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14. May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, is talking about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeatedly is repeated, "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they presented a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the beginning of the beginning of the beginning, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written about the documents that would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed, addressing and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulja Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve each withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there on the responsibility and the letters were always more common.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge for two years for the shut-up factory and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still in-run sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years of age waiting for the retirement in another complex, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part that he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial range from Cuba and the most important work producers was removed.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the municipalities in which they found themselves.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, then president in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that for those working, their factories were not in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="672">Since 2004, sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the people learned Gregorio Arleé Mañalich that many things change, but not always to the better if a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar tube factory was closed, or better, when they began to abdicate them, they listened to asphalted the streets, this also offers other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look up other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region at once.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production is not used for the supply of the community.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations Youth use Hip-Hop to express yourself and get your own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with approval of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Youth of the first Nations communities in Canada are dealing with topics that are important for them. they do not do so with hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour bring mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live cuts.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were headed by David's Pedagogues, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec, with ten Cree communities, and then with Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars worked together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is putting something that the young participations in the talks, such as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever of them comes to sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organise similar workshops with the trunk of winebago at the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo, in the field of the tribe of the Kitsumkalaround First nation in British Columbia, tells the story of Highway 16, also "Highway of tears," a road section in Westkanada, at which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous women have disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not resolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemhi First nation uses the motif of a video player to mediate how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indicative languages, although the youngsters do not rule in language-speaking languages in the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First nation will have recorded the refrain on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help of Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group that followed them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan is available the strophe in the heading as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel when no one ever would be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to go on earth on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you take out our Schrei</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will be lifted up for one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So, they can grow and lead the way of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do it, for which the creator has determined</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and supporters of Cree-Language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the strophe in silos (which is also published on his blog and is published here with approval):</seg>

<seg id="718">One can see plastic dishes in Japan almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers, what is located on the menu, are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanu (it is mandatory, "Plastic models of dishes") are exposed by every food that will be served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an industrial sector devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">The Kappabashi district is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes prepared by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga in front of more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so usual that they are not even more striking. however, a new trend is turned into the conspicuous mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger itinii series, published by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin renovated.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic dishes - decorative tubes, as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitesurfing collectors, such as in this case, refrigerie magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shock refrigeratorie magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essence is increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaans-don (a popular travel shell with seafood) has been turned into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also have this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like a apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing departure.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own art work. in this case, ikura or salmon roe uses, a popular Topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?."</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also receive a less appetite shape to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile support has the shape of melanking's ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">Moreover, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and straps of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other skurrile plastic dishes can be seen under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter The hashtag # 1.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, to the shokuhin renovated.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how Japanese plastic products are actually produced.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports and foreign media about the notorious "struggle against the drug trafficking in Mexico, the despair and the brutally known only in statistics. however, this mirror did not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this fight.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartridge, urged the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident is hardly anyone looking for the grief or to the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind each side, behind every bonding in the hundreds of secret graves, stories, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds could never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal animal Polttico is called the digital project "Apréa Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking to live"), which they will give up a voice and stories of people telling them in the fight between the prosecution and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizational crimes can not only be feared by our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and so many congregations will need to drive many kilometers to buy as milk as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as a fear of life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches up secret graves after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost their father's four sisters, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "Priest:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have given us to go and go to graves after the people who we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>

<seg id="772">"" "where should we get?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We just do not have to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we must present the international community the conflicts to show the fragility and the State.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writing by Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central and Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I already know illness and Sensation journalism now for some years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the title page to the newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling when I am the one that is obstructed or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be equal, or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to become great when he is great. and it's not normal that people listen to the "heroism" of the offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me, this is what if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear them, that something happened to them something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are going to be naked figures in a statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">The number of people's elessness is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village will be justified. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak that they spares from such tragedies, if they don't touch and still remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of compressive in the Capital area: like a family with drenations," she describes herself, as an armed crime month for month money from their business until they didn't just destroy the business, but also their family had torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost, and remember how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">His pain will never forget that trauma remains, and fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">We continue from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are or to kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked me in these terrible days, if weeping would solve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot to know how to get weeping. I must learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of Violence. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he has asked questions: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crimes?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to increase in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he says he had to kill himself, how to make a egg, potatoes that makes Tortillas warm and called "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each age of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had already gone over two years ago, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody Leiche of his father, who was shot from armed men out of a driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation existed in Juárez:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organized crime and fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world, due to the number of murders according to the German government Council, the government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the prosecutor's office were 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves the organized crime in Mexico and enter the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories are still alive in view of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who we have not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Apréa Vivir Con El Narco", the data journalism project Narcotheare launched in 2015, whose goal is to summarise the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the past four decades, in a definitive way.</seg>

<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" from Flickr users Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this post and the pages to which he left, include pictures where violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The factor check is important in one moment, in which it comes to lift a rumor or fake a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after anything the first time is dipped? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, it tends to exist further.</seg>
<seg id="820">This photo was taken by a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seven years ago.</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used to manipulate tragedies, which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This incorrect copy of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - Anders not the fact that it gives plenty of careful report about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But there are questions about our desire to talk to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank car crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tiled and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected, as it was ravaged, the streets in the region have become a full swing of blows that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">The car, however, fell victim to the victims of the tank.</seg>
<seg id="828">A representative agent described a fire ball, the demonic houses, including a cinemas near, which was full of people who illustrate the soccer world championships.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses rored and shortened corpses in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to infinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">An image with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur-user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the preset form the grauous scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It features rows of stolen body, which are attached to the ground during people.</seg>
<seg id="834">But this is not the end.</seg>
<seg id="835">More than the years the same photo was quenched by several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but certainly not real this in the related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the detonlegenic settlements of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Augenzeues reported drastically of atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and prayers.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports that 150 to 2,000 people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the numbers could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count corpses," said one of the human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were zelled, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only from satellite images the follow-up can be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unexplained, but the armies in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerges from the DR Congo again, as it fests as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of patches with flaws; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was prescribed as a cover for massacres.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example of the DR Congo on the sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange has also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on violence against the Rohingya, posters like the following in which these descriptions were collected with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page, which, in 2012, the president Myanmars Than met, monks and politicians had involved in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the picture from the DR Congo to assess this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original entry, which last updated on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news agencies, the AFP as their source, had also appealing this statement, but had not to cover the picture from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these wrong conjunctions go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere in all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With the help of a "converted photo search" you can see how far more information limits can be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="862">A converted photo search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images under 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the discussed picture of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed lot of private pages, platforms social media and community and national publications and are available in many languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded false reports, other attempts to unmask the fake.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have applied examples of the misused use and associated with the respective countries, based on which, on which side they were published. thus, we want to monitor the range more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Some examples of the most common use (which in some cases were also connected with each other) can be used for improper use.</seg>

<seg id="910">The article has been updated in 2014 and the time of this publication is still included in the image.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article by 2014 about students who had been murdered by Boko Haram, published by the Catholic message page Análisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the image is not derived from the redness, but it claims to put it a "similar dumpic attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">As the picture later, in connection with the massacre of Boko Haram from 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to oppose it.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyormaryuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo is provided with this Twitterhashtag, and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 and the stop on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">Thus, they wanted to achieve these events that took place mutually in the name of the Islams, a major interest in the name of the Islams.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was swept as a cover to the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 (and more than 9.300 times), but the messages that were associated with it were taken into no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to raise awareness to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reports in comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo's attack.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was written supposedly written by a "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" over the Nigerian massacre, in circulation, discussions were illustrated like this in Vietnamese, and declared it to the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy where the picture was included in the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretiner missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos was distanced.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, generators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey), Tinymis also points out, but are no longer traceability: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / datestamps exist on the crawcrawler and cover them about image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only significantly after the original accident of 2010, the picture may finally see a correct description, but the original entry is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that pass through this post. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used as regards to major discussions about the silence in connection with exiting from Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - murder of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing is used to discuss how an African life is assessed by comparison to European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can't receive this images longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there is enough people who have unintentional content to comfort the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugars this atmosphere of the false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the ressive of pictures of a refusal to detect the tragedy. sometimes these pictures even require of the victims itself.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time the concern is that forcible pictures and spectators desifying and to take away the ability to feel emempie (such as this study, which sought how to help protect the forcible media).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are quite a lot of forcible representations in the news media, fact, it is essential that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists try to experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". they will be thoroughly thought about the situation in which a picture would be something sugared, but actually replaced by the context or completely misused species.</seg>

<seg id="945">Such words are in every language: they express a certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistreplaceable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, the Spanish sounding esa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resists persistent in each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is necessary to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>

<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog one finds words from Vanuatu's language, such as:</seg>

<seg id="1004">They have forged me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practising our religion different.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify us to be a Muslim but different art. but somehow we are all fitted into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective performance that as soon as Muslims who do not fit in there, be muscled.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Muscled will be established</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I'm now, he was a orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western event, Religion Rumis was deleted, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a major portion of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another part is found in the reductive images of Muslims, which have been colonized Western books already for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting image is determined by the dark men whom you should fear and the exotic woman whom you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The pioneering Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said had dismantled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continues.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have been working for thirteen years in the News industry, and I have seen how this powerful Narrative Narrative swiss dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This Narrational overshadows the reality that during the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US could not choose their first female presidential dators in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This Narrational failed to recognise that when French, Muslim women will carry into public buildings, and acid-Arab, Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body to cover their entire body, which both are two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A mighty group exercised his "control" to the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong Narrational weakens Muslim women to perform movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It looks at over it, that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to the American soil of Africans, which were brought to slave with slave shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This Narrational has occupied our collective pre-conception of art and faulty, that often Sikh men and children are often intimental attacks and chicings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the species we can tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Among the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we can do more than just stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or to alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also make Narrative that help us understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And in fact, my industry is shattered to capture the Narrativ of the 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1039">And we are shaken here where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of religious group in America.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way here and now in spite of a voice barrier with somebody in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, the founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is a possible answer to stories in their original language.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the Unknown Blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get to obtain the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas, like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not transferred to the children's natives.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the mapping of the project this:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided if we accept cities, do not forget diverity - safe spaces that they must not forget to be responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is linked to understand" "" "these events instead" listen to "" "listen," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, historical writers will initially set their history first in their own language and translate or explain it to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are no professional storyteller, their devotion, and their images lead to it that the listeners are on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions rather than the language no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round the history of Rassidatou Konates will also take the opportunity to clarify the typical customs of war.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak from the bunnies and the pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explained the importance of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to be an audience who does not understand your language?" with a wide countdown he shares his feel of infos:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were very attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS in contact to organise their own history numbers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a retesting of public debts of Puerto Rico, who took to 72 million US dollars on the last 3 April 2017, participating in the capitol of Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizen) for the neural testing of debts) and the National Assembly of Puerto Ros.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the remuneration of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is your claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Ros calls for the politicians, benches and government agencies, responsible for debts to be taken into responsibility for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial examination and a tap committee without any personal interests to the public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that deals in favor of business.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ros refused to pay a debt that is not its own.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be disable with sinking pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ros requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">The measures imposed by the outside are without the participation and conviction of citizens to be able to expire by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian factual developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Basle Safadi, has been missing for over one year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, support his supporters and members of the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he has paid for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference dedicated to digital culture that will be held in Berlin, dedicated an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher that produced by so-called 'Book sprints' finished books within three to five days (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published in the last year and has been licensed here, includes a range of essays that deal with free culture under the oppression of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for freedom knowledge will be built and what are the true cost, which is associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activist, artist, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working on site to view our newsfeeds to create our newsfeeds and create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison, where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information on his current state or position.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title College of Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that insisted on his release, and who want to know him back in his own life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Basel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, has let many of us start to thinking about their own destinies, acts and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why Are We Here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What do we have been abandoned in this process of timeless extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The website for Open Source and digital activist has been a government of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and attorney in Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "commanding the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted on 12 November 2015 by individuals who submitted themselves as insider the Assad government and replaced them with a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His position and condition will remain still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Basle played a decisive role in which access to the Internet and to know how to expand the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and a moment of director of the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassel's cultural prototypes have been predictive as the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the waymark of numerous civilians and then merging the Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesian traditions and personalized influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would have everything that architecture, which does not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip is created in the digital archeology and the conservation has created a time capsule which will be open to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of unestimated value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Moreover, Basle could not close this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also has contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and teaching, teaching me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I'm overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read English well, to write and to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gateway to the technology. he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other inted, as they use computers, at least theoretical, without that they actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten auf), a branch office which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was found in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together a year along with the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She sailed his texts to him when she visited him and he translated them out of the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1228">It happens in every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I will sing in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose my mind in the moment, in which we embraced us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That is no matter to me any of the hazards,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, boilers and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison of the prison.</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I grind in every detail your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">When I carry my passion for myself,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes may say</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will send another piece of my soul with you...</seg>

<seg id="1239">To return all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And on your absence to weep and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I felt myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the arrest of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:</seg>

<seg id="1248">According to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights), since the beginning of the protests in 2011, Bashar al-Assads has disappeared for more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence through the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organization Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrian since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community announces the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today we repeat our claim in hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption, Director was condemned to previous post by corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with wrath on an corruption, where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half his imprisonment in which the corruption was celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a model of Diodino Cambaza, who arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants with perimpersion of 54 million metical (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was made from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice became head of Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guided tour and ordered immediately his return to the company what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Attorney General of the Republic, requesting the application, there was no obstacle for Cambaza, to reject its old post, as the company had completed no discipline procedure after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants are not hot in this promotion.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution which convenes for public transparency, sentenced in an interview with the Deutsche Welle's decision to present the company's decision:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the absence of transparency and is even a return step in terms of the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know, that the company will have a discipline procedure against the infringing market.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company was silent, however, however, does not consider appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, rejects this behavior as well as being contradicted in the case ":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, it would be adviser if he was condemned to a prison and has sent half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could have paid lectures and motivating words, he could consult and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But when he is incompetent, he accepted to be integrated into the company that he helped damage harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, the Director does not include any Moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Camaraza was rewarded by the State because he would not believe him, that one would reward you in such a way that the state has already been insulted so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Camaraza is missing the morally to return and to the state, * he had already served a unique opportunity to minister to the state, but instead, only himself served the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as a handele in order to be an exhaustible money source and the state itself is tired, the preloaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man has been rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francas Zeúte prefers to remember the Prime Minister of Mosambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief has been in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but also as sharp as sharp as having said - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous verbs, being energically confirmed that "an ambitious man could be anything, also the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora said, "I don't know if a ambitious man change, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is the same as a criminal act. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions were also borrowed:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment, he was only 10 years old and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today it sets him the company, in which he repented funds, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeupais - Ow himself (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1287">The burial word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or sparaging.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their mail from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Even though the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin, or in general, as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored up the word "Kalar" or the same thing. (in Burmmeso script) as part of a initiative to address the widespread problem of Hasselt in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the ascent of radical nationalistical movements has been given an extremely talented coonnation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that usually used by Ultra-nationalists as Hassi for Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight Hasselt in Myanmar, the company has focused a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'might usually be associated with racism, but the word is not displayed in Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that Posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts for the use of its use, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several burial words with different meanings that have the same accounting sequence like 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese even 'Kalar htaing', as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spage-se), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocrisy Aung Kaung has explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on the spiritual species if they could know how he could reduce his back pain by playing a vocalist.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence Ku la - "healing" (Ku) + the age word (la) relative to Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Halls is the opinion that they must decrease in Hassle of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic it, before it deletes all postal addresses, which to spread racism in the suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automaticism will not understand what you are looking for Faculook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, the mail is carefully designed to analyse and check it by the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spage-aged).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these three sisters who hate speech-wide, will receive a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is at the time to prism their national ism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action can send a powerful signal to all, Hasselt will feature any efficiency, the efficiency of this strategy is not long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of bucks often have a cat and mouse game, whereby the users' social networking will simply start to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook started to delete his posture when he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and me, the liken, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours, because the Post "didn't talk to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from people, who have no negative intentions or those trying to show their opinions against Hasselt radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post is removed, who has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassler from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author divided his mind about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believed that Facebook would have had more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community has to ask:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook like a prosperous intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censored version will only bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems, as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned as words as "chair" or "Builders curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they made mistakes, they tried not trying to resolve them.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would have only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits giving them a large turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic Zenensorship has made a lot of fun among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of serious taking it, users are aware of Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasslanguage, to see if their posts are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts, who were not Hasselt, but nevertheless removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission is used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmmesan text is "I want to sit on a chair and add an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">The Post says "If you are a doctor, do you heal men?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists, social networks have used to expand their voices and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt should additionally heat power in social networks, in addition to the communities in Myanmar, especially in the missile of Rakhine where struggles between Muslims and Buddhists were forced to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticized for his conviction that hate crimes against his burese pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply send the word 'Kalar', it would have occurred better in context than in the context of concentrating initiatives and learned them from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">It is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously approved a law which should offer this practice, so that the marriage age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In front of this change of the event, some members were taking duistic and muslistic religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 the leader of the interreligious organization (IRO), a group that had gathered the representative of the various religious groups of the country, that the state should not be ensued, since that, at age not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting partner to the UN Children's Rights, the minority is considered to be aged under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The UN's statistics for 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 years, in Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's Statistical Office of the country, that from 1997-2007, confirmed more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that endeavoured to abolish laws for children's toe, followed at the feet and rejoiced great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless not everything went perfectly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu guide, for example, had no concerns to say to the criticising of the children's grounds, they should be damned even about her own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious Opposition sps for tensions in this actually rather complicated matters, and some doubts came up whether the opposition would vote at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's toe - despite the 4 transformers (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would already make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave a status update, which once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the Children's Eve was approved by the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After he was agreed in the Senate, the draft can now be made to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled because the laws for children have been changed finally.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who was a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary Gerede, which has swallowed up the core of the thing but you know what? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is almost every price.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaph, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Birma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Before months, Maharaj announced his intention to accept the judicial steps that the law should be passed, and he seems to redeem his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General Al rawi, a supporter of the law said that it would be quite right when Maharaj was accused against the law, would be aware of the debate on the subject.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was deliberately presented on January 18, 2012 to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the United States, globally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over one month, Turkey closed the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is clear how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series forges themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques of technic users are used to use blocking tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date articles from the New York Times reported that Turkey has not the third largest VPN emency of the world), if most unusual Wikipedia users fall not into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been shut down by Wikipedia since 2008, just as recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been taking place regularly since the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most important country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains unlocked, there are now multiple MirrorPages (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform all Turkish Wikipedia pages on whose decentralized Peer-to-peer network (i.e., computer calculator connections), which does not support the system of domain names and therefore makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the illegal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a Blogpost, IPFS reports on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the messages (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we have set everything to push Snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the www.wikipedia.org site.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also showed that this stage was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only deals with screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consoli of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiyum.org, a Mirrorsite of Wikipedia, as well as the WikMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use similar Mirrorsites when the country's respective country is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consoli reported subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices, as well as employees for Mozilla at the Panigrahi's Open Source speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy server, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One gets to another URL, which is not the original. that's what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially the server runs on the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself, if this is blocked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos, which he looked around, never satisfied. they were missing with poorly positionable motifs and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him itself a camera to wear and try to do the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptar, has been working on the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown direct next to the Chitwan National Park, offering him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos of the attention of Nepochas wildlife world.</seg>
<seg id="1422">On Facebook, he described this first-class situation in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home when I called Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Lodge), when he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river bridge is just a few minutes from the tourist village of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to convert pictures to Knipsen!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives collaboration with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals Nature and would like to understand the understanding of that wild animals are not so fury, as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, because he stood by faces from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disrupt from the opinion of sheep in sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Even because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he is immediately right, we are looking forward to and he stats me through the sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To encourage the protection of wild animals, Sagar is placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) to his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, its passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent to catch at Bardia National Park's recordings. up to 12 days it took up until he could photograph a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanov and was originally posted on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a Content-Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even from older men to the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a ponomen or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chartisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's husband, as well as the fear of consequences, they should be the standard miserable, in practice this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Oglia by a guilty tribunal and refrying them by their family and the village community after having addressed a secret relationship with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not common to name, is also widespread under men. however, they have much less assignments to be feared when at all, they don't have to follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashore, nine women, including health workers, and housewives, with a unique club, were thus quickly to become the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, to whom they discuss the hostesses of the patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which there are in 13 Indian States, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the community Video Volunteers and is preparing for mining of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pac has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera to the discovery of practices, such as kindergarten up to the union of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and heads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports that these clubs were created a safe place for these women and made it at the same time at the ambassadors of mural.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini shown in its discussion round, was the case of women who do not call their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">According to their husbands don't listen to the names of their husbands, it is a brilliance that they should be debated and never challenged.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes it a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't last, is regarded as a keyword, as woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition has been so deeply rooted that we never have never thought to this discussion about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini wanted to have had her husband never before the name, tried to test at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother in law and my husband remained long after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash my husband, turned back to me, and said, I should call him yet by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini released its first discussion garden with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" never before. some believed that there was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tested the discussion with a exercise in gear.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat every participant in the name of their husband with different feelings - happy, offend, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years, and this was the first day that they brought the name of their husbands on her lips," says Rohini Paen in the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a century of centuries, in which married women could never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">One woman was so shy, that during all the exercise, she was just before him; another one decided to leave the whole fruit of frustration against him and his family by leaving him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatically.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the Adrenalinkausch about it, with an ancient fires broke out, the women decided to try them at home to call their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas put them into the head: his wife couldn't stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law bore them, she was afraid, and told that it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a group of participants was less serious and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported that women have tried to stop other practices, as for example, the tracing of the cinnoberred point on the forehead showing the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would bear the zinnored point, if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it up to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women do not have it completely, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discuspids is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and targets.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip at each discussions speed.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we packed lunches and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want to make women to make that what could hear," "" "says she." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes. they danced and sangen and talked about things which they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, but I also have some things, for example, as our identities are associated to our husbands, never as honestly spoken.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great, certain things noisy as they can say, absolutely no matter how small it occurs.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion of discussion, we have talking about the concept of honor and is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been carried away in their marriage since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is okay, but some wanted a Salwas-Kurta, a wide shirt above a trousers, they don't have drunk.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of war and discussion about the excerpts of their own clothing choice, the morals connected to the Saris and much more, Wugger Rohini had her own pair of Kurtas (shirt) into a discussion round, so that women could carry her.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can bear Jeans and Rohini is sure to make it easy.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months has changed slightly since its first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things come slowly into the roll:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then we heard it back to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do not make it, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two shall say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now contribute to each time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion group know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the folds for greater freedom of movement or their own clothing choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By increasing each other, it will be aware that they sit in the same boot.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club is each of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be an chain reaction if any woman being in the club home and other people are talking about what we talk and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from prominent groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published in the framework of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of incarcerated Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has put attention in international community attention after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he has been hospitalized because of liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(State risk), after taking part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that led the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Lius case as "an internal matter," he says it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">In China, China continues to continue calls from the international community to allow Nobel Peace Laureates and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, release or permit a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the Paares in Beijing, others are completely wiped out on the topic.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has collected some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, hit the case at the end of June, to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A speaker, however, refused to comment if the United Nations should exert pressure in order to make liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway hit the stores after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government reported that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations have only been continued in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement in order to record the exports to China, because exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news had common that Liu was serious, the Nobel Peace Committee brought his hope to an expression and invited Liu to catch his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">Liu was represented during the ceremony by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was requested to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow medical support to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius on how it hurried in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We also anticipate that China cancels all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits, they wish they would be able to communicate and able to communicate with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad decided that the Americans asked that he has the possibility to help treatment abroad if it be helpful to him in his satisfaction. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">An spokesperson from the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message of the Chinese authorities to release the Chinese authorities, not only Liu, but also his wife Liu Xia will free of house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The challenge of US Embassy moved a formative response from China to itself, with the appearance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no land has the right to have to be" "", "to make answer of Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travel sickness and access to the medical supply of his choice, to which they are entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz are also introduced a decision in the congress to push the Chinese government to push the Chinese government to unloose Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I challenge China to unconditionally release the Nobel Prize winner # LiuXiaobo unconditionally, that he can adapt to a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">The German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hope that Liu is "all the medical support he needs to be" and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Peking from the News agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vortex could shallow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called for China to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius advocate declared AFP who could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital, and that it is not permitted to talk with someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells of:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, to maintain and freedom for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, the French Foreign Ministry called China in a declaration of humanitarian reasons for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures have to be taken to make sure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, which he, regardless where, needs. furthermore, his wife and family will have to contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news broadcaster France Info told that the French government would be called Liu in the country, announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that there is no further information that France may eventually take it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the landlandings in Taiwan called for China on June 27 to release Liu and a greater tolerance towards those present to show peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu would also called to allow China to treat the sick of intellectual liu to treat themselves in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed very careful in a statement on June 28 around Liu and gave that many of them asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my faith, that the initiatives that he took, and which he had been punished for which he had led to a harmonic, more stable and wealthy of China, which again had contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged me when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Land?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem stupid since Singapore is recognized by international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has caused a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting, on the occasion of a meeting of the State of the State of New York, the minister said that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It undersupport that Singapore should be considered to be a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked if New York be a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is, with most people going to do an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to turn logic" to defend the existing Authorization of Power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifice, this valuable country is to create, we hear that we have no land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It had so vulgar, it had the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities, an compulsory infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugon were not very Nobel: he defended up an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system from Singapore with other 'ordinary countries, in view of that, he appeared undemocratically democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to Chicago, San Francisco or New York City, equally equally in cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as you reach the core point of the subject again, the good old lyre of the authoritative feeders will return to be the Democrats, abandoned the vertipped logic as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final result, during the last week of Shanmugam we had given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judiciative, our political system really not non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions cloaked with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his mind as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is to which country belongs to our town...</seg>
<seg id="1707">Short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our new K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog his commentary he comments on the critics saying that you could start the entire address of the conference, so that you could understand the context of statements by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" be as a country, "he declared why the elections in Singapore would be so uneasy, even if we are looking forward to free and righteous elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He moved to Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">As he said that Singapore was no land, "he obviously did not act in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam, who as leader of a heretofore-growing generation, making such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what has said the Minister of Justice of Singapore,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde that awaits me - could I not agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, Member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes, really associated and is aware of what he is defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review shredded the weaknesses of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam have committed an error, or was it a friend spokesman?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is no country, we will only be regarded as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which land go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role in the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of severe significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why did the people afford their military service, defend only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our rosa Human Dish?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Tends the journal Journey of a Decade for the years, Singapore is and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition appears many points of becoming more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we are often saying that" "" "the defense of the country is especially" "" "etc." "", "but this is not quite true." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk to the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest section of this series is written by Nevis Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most likely to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on which situation it takes place, it is said to be polite to show interest in its interacting partners by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification, the default response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, nature." many canans cook in front of rage, if they are kept for Americans, but does not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For somebody who doesn't know, there is a little that distinguishes us from Americans by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why many canans conquer a Canadian flag at their backpack if they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">They all love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans.....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before entering the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>

<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First to be considered "nice" to be considered to be "nice," is basically to be idle, but tragically unsignificant figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian double-Doppelgänger).</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand famous Pop-Band has published a music video that the Junta parodiert, which took power in 2014, and in spite of her proclaiming the civilian government, continues to regained the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which his friend makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video is indirectly relates to the continued military supremacy of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other users for their courage to describe the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days the video was divided into Facebook with 1,254 times and received 8.800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin-Video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists to view this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can interpret as a creative and entertaining introduction into Thai policy, as it does it with the situation of the country under the Junta reign.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political themes, which have continued Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" possibly relate to the drastic section 44 of the temporary Constitution, given to the Commander in Chief of the Healer absolute decision on monetary policy issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious programme for the "Settings change" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law relating to computer criminality, whose vage and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to revitalize activists and other criticism of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, supervised the online content, and the persons accused of which the monarchy is accused of having prosecuted the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand focuses on "Lese majority" (Majesty damage).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was declared war in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta is still pursuing, is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, even though security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a merger of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shows how people are thrown into a black supply wagons, before they bring them into an internment camp, another problem exists.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists will sit in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long-term penalties, they should animate the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society recovers slowly in Eastern Europe, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abian war officially ended, but its scars are still heavily visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuanarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are in the carbon pool of Absinasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, deasies, Georgier and Armenians lived and worked together for Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today we live on the biggest part of Russians and chases in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called clasants in AbsinAsia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were still more than 10,000 people, today there are only a few hundred people in these clerics.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of more than 16,000 people had hardly increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1894">In Mexico "mom Africa" immigrants home to their long journey</seg>
<seg id="1895">Concepción González Ramírez is a small hotel in Tapachula, in the State of Chiapas, near Mexico to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org, and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the road of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican female, a small woman with an corals-pink Brillante frame and golden coloured earstuds in teddy form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula. nevertheless they know many in the name of Mama.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This surname is the fact that the hotel (or rather they themselves) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approx. 2.50 euros the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance hall there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez is telling people in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mom Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject no one.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them also and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medication that they could not pay, they massaged them with a balm which exhausted from the long voyage.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa is a reasonable surname for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a man's head) posed with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly affectionately.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very well here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hopes to go to Boston where he will find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, who are on the way to the United States, normally a first stop in South America and go to the North.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other signs of mom Africa. "mom Africa is a well-known name on the route," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and the Africans have often travel the route and that Afrikaner is already talking to Whatsapp by Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his pioneers, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker for construction sites of the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mum Africa since months. he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to sell the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Ms. Ramírez's contact in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our mother and we never let it go," reply He is smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells you that their guests will often send text message when they continued to greet them or tell her about their journey through the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">They don't know a lot about Africa, but their guests have taught you to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps known here, but it is not the only wireless hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a slackgasse leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is Policeman and has found that the ticket to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">There are 25 people there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleeping on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cookery outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela states that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," says he. "I experienced what they experienced.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help others. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from a raid on his office in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels across Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to give him money, without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single one, has offered its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and is still trying to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, the travellers get their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy about that her house is full but it is nostalgically, because of them that go away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blamed them in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair braids which you have made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">There is a check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Xinjiang residents, ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile notification to install the District government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "the communication is said that the app" "" "allow access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, ònios use the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh Women in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture were arrested because they had installed shortly after they had installed the app, messages with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police there was that the app retrieve the sources and the distribution of terrorists, along with "illegal religious activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is the blocking, pornographic web site, of online fraud, Trousers and Phishing sites to give users to it, how much time they spend online, and to remote control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote actors or even Hacker may be able to manipulate the home network of a person or steal.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focusing on the experience of users in the major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote-violent ethnic-regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit to disturbances and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities are often classified extreme censors and surveillance activities, as well as routinely Internet televing.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This is based on Twitter based media outlet "images from China" (which is mandatory), the zensiert is published in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint where the occupants had checked the residents indiscriminate whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered using a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people to use.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the China" (the year) has a Jingwang-product description from which emerged that the software can increase the data request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang are computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang to electronic hand shafts.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and affiliated affiliated facilities including universities and research institutes are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity office at the operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a Regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, representing her "personal ID cards, phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" by the local police.</seg>

<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to feed my whole quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-bare body that stretches out on the ground was the perfect power supply.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The dew vanished and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep myself again; let's say that this was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed that came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning bet.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the space ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free opinion and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib offers the most of its time indoors; sometimes chequered to his screen, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what can be left, there is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine addicted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house, which had been in existence since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs were forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyeen (approximately: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib is a passionate active activity, which was transferred to the conservative majority and its old established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free opinion expressed by art and rapesmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often spreading on issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian thundering. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that go from Damascus to Syria until all of them in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib is regarded as a man who is not restricted by limits, and he can feel the people with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he had not open it, he heats an extra leaning against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones, anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian thundering of the second generation," even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life of life," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he shketh in water soluble Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, in that time it is earmarked for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law says that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sentimely called young Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Fundamentally, the mule lies dorm coffee and the shwaden of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you cast a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence, it's easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to do not land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry Jordanian citizens recently had to cancel his appearance at the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliaments who support the Islamic State Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual acts Hamed Sinno, contradicted the cultural and traditional standards of the country, and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press spokesman of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert "had been cancelled because of sexual orientation of the prison.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arab Spring, human rights and free opinion expressed in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism in which the old proven legitimacy of the regime states in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila rated the jordan people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to use "for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply snested Rhetorik, but in fact a clear out-crystalline reality reflected in Jordan which occurs in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib resides traditional sex standards by helping out his vision of fate Arabic women to have vorehelifying sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The skeleton shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them who actually need to trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan, the number of "honorary murder" increased - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore reached its peak in 2016; however, the number of honorary infrastructure came to their climax in 2016; however, Jordan's institutional infrastructure is missing to support women who tempted murder or domestic violence in order to maintain a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the Crimean War in 1954, women who are subjected to danger of inhospitable violence, "and for their release is often necessary for a long-long bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will nothing happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for that, not before themes, which have long as taboo together in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib insists that his work is politically, there is, however, that he is his music that is full of explicitly access to sexuality, freedom and expression of expression, not by politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I have tried politics, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song named "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question after the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb, the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically challenging in the core of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the next course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market, in which one can get what you want "- be faith or belief, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">It notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan over the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals yet have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian online programme Roya, in order to be noted that his comments was torn out of the context and turned out into his mind.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a revised version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that Intoleranz is not guilty of homosexuals.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuises, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nude that was to work later on behalf of the Caliph, in the eighth century, he could not write about homosexuality, why can Jordi do this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, did not have to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the fascist kingdom there is nothing new to remember that the government attacks against free expression of expression and that progressive voices will be placed on silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian News Service had taken several former government officials and members of the lectured association, with the reasons that they expressed themselves critical on comments in social media, causing problems faced with the deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of what is the concert Hdaibs, only the tip of the icebergs - the real challenge is to do a structural change in the next generation of the Jordi.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, Prodaib 'Leila has stopped for him for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - is that Hdaib - is made of slow, deliberate and inwardly changes. it is sure that these changes take place in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He do not only dreams, his work up to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience them. "</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region may attaching the region using music, art and literature on a real and basic openness - and not through bombs, streamlined, and artificial way-led democracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib will pass on and thus also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was achieved by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which belongs to the Aman as a student Fellow.</seg>

<seg id="2150">This great, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the fog festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a version of the Tanabata festival that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory clearly states that the troops come across from the west Japan's army in order to force the Indian population of the region, Emishi near to the knee.</seg>

<seg id="2156">A joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars have just been seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and even a breathtaking fashion to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time in Peru - how many other intermediate and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and thus also the unusual hairs of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), has led to this more normal citizen to the experienced hands of hairdressing, who can train this manger hairs.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairdressing, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the hairdressing of the hairdresser "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts believe in order to show someone who can create the eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos to current competitions there is on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to create their weapons against hairdressing dies and instead of bad advice about training in the hairdressing salon that enables them to find work.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the published version of the contribution "Liebeskind to Guerillaccio" which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published in the context of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to humans who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet more important, people who feel right out, affection for you?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question was the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), the young people encouraged and writing Guerrilla's letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was a place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guerilla's FARC (german: revolutionary forces), which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signing of the peace agreement as it was so important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before Colombian, there is still a long way until they can talk about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla soldier who lived for many years in Illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and contributed around the clock their weapons with themselves, must now reintegrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian Society, which had accustomed to life in constant fear, and in some cases deep Hass had accustomed to guillers in some cases, they must now take into their ranks and support them up to build a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian will close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people wrote letters written - love message to former Guerillacters, to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former Guerrilla soldier, who then will be handed out personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was made in the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian was the possibility to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">It declared that we love the people who love to write from thousands of love letters, but those who forgot to need them much to need.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He has been telling this year to share his love with people who needed the urgent matters.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighter of the FARC, which now will find their place in society and to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace." they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought that someone would be forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the foundation BogotArt reists to the camp to overtake the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC paid themselves on how they had done it earlier in order to meet the commands of their leader.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive any precepts, but letters filled out of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies between them," telling the policy programme Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighters led me by the camp of Guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I seen in one of the "Camouflage" (a kind of cabin, where the Guerillaccomplicity live), I saw a Guerillactation, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL pomegranator, a deadly weapon in a thorn nap.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him, saying," "" "hello, what do they just do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answered a letter that someone has written me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life has written me something so nice, so answer I them. "then suddenly the tears run over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I remembered him, and set me beside the pomegranines.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companions of this kind, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society without waiting for us with the open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned to circumvent weapons with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning of the prelude there were students and some leader of the FARC to a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all up as already war and the FARC already existed in secret places.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC gave the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years we experienced, as the social injustice on the State of the State. now, where we have the opportunity to develop us to a political party, we can help to create the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For the aim of these magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people had never heard that they had never found hearing, and to know that people who have seen often as a monster and were even hated even only people with lovely feelings that were turned over by their environment and the environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, where the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it was comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage caused to bring us a little, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Esús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after deforestation peace would rule out.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to protest himself and to protest their rights. and that's also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We now rely on the FARC on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what kind of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise over all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and offer sacrifices, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, will imminate many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way it will give many obstacles, but we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2244">With terror, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of the persecution in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that depends on a clonal reading over the LGBTQ municipality, isn't it possible on the night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about what happens in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Over several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines after reports published the deterioration, torture and killing of queer men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities who arrested the suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transverse, was born in Grozny, and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">In her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they were grown, it became aware that Chechnya was no safe place for her, why she went to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnya had experienced their housewife, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life, she nourished her last dudes in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transverse that existed in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her when I thought it would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere in the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his techens friends, with the following message: "then, there is no more men in Chechnya, who can remove these shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents went through the whole Whatsapp round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing, a few grocery bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a masculine saying: "here is a gift to you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned back, I felt somewhat in my body, but me did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a set, but this time in the Chechen:" "" "how long will you still honour the family?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awoke last dudes in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had to get everything and began to cry out.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">At the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in whom the men or women have been laid?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there stands still my male name; but the doctor relied, and laid me to women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Therefore I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got to do with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They cried unto me, and they said, Strangers, stranger, some perfectly unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightfall.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to return to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They exhibited absurd claims: some told me, I had to prove that I didn't raise my sex at the official TV in Grozny, and tell that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I've got baskets size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family tries to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people said once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, that's not only your family, but the entire republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">Of my mother, it became too much and she put a strick on the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Thankfully, the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with a dark windows and a number plate on a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time I was clear that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My Human Rights Friends tested the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons, I don't want to give its name, but I want to say that I am all remember; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">By her help, I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to phone my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered at a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I connected the SIM card to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe you, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you plug. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, this is a tabs topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still bear a few traditional Caucasian elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So very much I wish I could not overcome this seam barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that while my mother is alive, I will do my best to violate it.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person out of their past - so remember my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the long time I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody who had a one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told, that during Ramadan it was not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In order to load them, they probably charge the relatives of this, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" was experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also still able to gable men store in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, especially those who have no range of relatives or those of their relatives have been dropped to imagine Kadyrows judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are listed there, so you can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be moved, they will show their body on TV and claim that they had attacked some village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these men were not just disappeared, but has not dipped them to radically.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now only a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I've just spent someone who was incarat one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was even when people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">However, they have not been presented as bandits until now, there were no reports yet. we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could this man not be allowed to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wearing my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known throughout Grozny, when I was alive there, and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia applied, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much more secure than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">In Russia, however, Russia wanted to bring us to the "civil" civil society, but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had dyed lashes, wore tube jeans and short pieces.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "the safety Ministry of Sharia never has a hair made of me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks had stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, there met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speeching language: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "spinning not over the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">One said it often to children, if it is fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so just did you shut up their eyes before you because they believed, you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never been insulted, chased and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace time last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long as Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about Moral in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He doesn't talk about us, but premature over the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who waited in advance, looked forward at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I still am active as activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communed with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We perfectly organize Teetreffs, gathering together, I have to get them to hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't leave a penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people, when I abstacked them.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hiddean?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alway.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So, nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechnya, who prepares you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no swinging at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestians have those who have the Kabardiner who are Russians also; on all the planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I am from there, therefore it is unpleasant to hear what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - Taking Muslims who go into the mosque and during Ramadan it - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think of the sidentity of men who love males, and they believe that men are changing his sex to make up more intimate experiences. but this is a truant.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different habit settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry, I'm doing so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2412">In front of a century, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and in 1925 great efforts undertook to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of opinion, written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. article was subject of several discussions where many different positions came to an expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the commentary below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women, especially white women, who designate themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even thought well thought out scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">"" "that women are still under stringent observation, if it comes to do with their body." ""</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women or later, in diverse areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is deliberately and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come on skin colour, on Black Cis women, on black transidente women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community, or black women from the Diaspora; when I say what kind of physical and verbal women have been used, both in and outside of feminist movement, leaving many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they are all agree that women - all women have come together to gather "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing for equality (some) of women to achieve equality.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexual violence a institutionalized form rassimilated, there are black women to be exposed to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or beyond that there are fewer women and women of other ethnicities and men more than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often be accounted for as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spans and women have been exposed to higher risk with migration background to suffer from domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the other hand I want all men, all men, and all men, nor any skin colour the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot bring me as a black woman to take into account the white woman who refused to regard to their thinking as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I'm exhausted and I won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere who always turned over me and countless other black women and always rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "In his speech," "" "I am no wife?" "" "and I also refused to justify a ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized nature in the black woman." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refused to join me groupings, which also absorb through cultural events of our customs and customs to describe their egoeccentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not try to increase white women the importance of overcutting of skin colour and sex. for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the Intersectional Feminism was founded in order to give wives of different approach and renounce the feminism of feminism, still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I preferre to leave me full and whole of feminism, join me and brought me to life of the Womanism, instead of using myself for a white feminist paradigm, which is so persistent that Intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women in our own performances and give us into the spans that are created for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana said: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we are returning to our own way, in which they are perfectly safe and honors the spiritual, mental, sedical, physical and even the spiritual elements you can make the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and non-sectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can raise black women and women of other cultures, because I existed in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and for my existence as a wife as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can glow in an environment, in which my life wasn't survived, neither ignored, nor yet rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would have had a victim of mistreatement.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read about it earlier, I thought that only women have happened to be subjected to violent men because they are violent.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his insist and various attacks during their two-year relationship, and telling how he had insulated it.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorisch, whether he ever had lifted up his hand against them, refused to refresh his conduct as well as a form of mistreaternment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users surveyed in Mariana, why they had fallen so long from Carlos and not left him earlier.</seg>

<seg id="2518">In the group, they can speak with others about their experiences to listen to each other and join each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner was finally able to convince them to convince them.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays in the authorities without a result and also of their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against their former partner who developed to become an unexpected judicial struggle between Paraguay and her native country, mainly by money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient realisation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws, which are very well, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The ad of Missions is a path of resistors and fight against corruption in justice, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, provides great problems on the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorEllas (# Fürstencil).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiyaMenos (# non-Simple) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law beats to explain Femizid to a stand alone punishance and harder as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislator has changed in some points to win the MPs to the Law that the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are prohibited in Paraguay, to be punished by up to five years of imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill, intended to charge the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process, which have to bear the victims of violence themselves, if they would only need to refund and secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law was not effective if the legislature does not provide adequate financial resources:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse as part of human relationships is seen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must be held that violence is no longer regarded as a bit small.</seg>
<seg id="2537">He who lies in view of these facts is guilty and carries out that the perpetrators enter the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to refund so long admissions to mistrust do not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">However, on 10 November 2016, the Act was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage in cases of domestic violence in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor, to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The string of words "gender," "political violence," and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is considered serious setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and working version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurdish. this article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weilichefrauam), who reports about the certainty of women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continued to attacks</seg>
<seg id="2546">"this website has been closed due to a decision of the information Minister," to read the Azamn website.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Italian authorities have closed an independent Arabic newspaper Azamn for its coverage of corruption in the Sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison where he is a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and returned to trial, later restored.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, when he came to power after he had instructed his father, Said ibn Taimur, which had set off by one.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The sultans rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces, in particular national freedoms, including press freedom, offences and human rights defenders, independent journalists, blogger, and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities of peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and encouraging citizens, also activists, taking their views on public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, her closing ceremony, and the imprisonment three of its editors in the last year is a hard blow for the press freedom of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that has been reported on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) since its formation in 2007, until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016 security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor of Cheesdakter of Azamn, firmly issued in the newspaper on July 26, 2016 was issued an article entitled "High Priority Parties related to the Justice" massacre. in this time it went to Corruption in judicial authorities and the involvement of high-level officials.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, Member of the editorial committee, was arrested in front of the Special Department and arrested by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS received the deputy chief editor of Yousef Al-Haj, who was acting as chief editor for Al-Maamaris.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed at indefinitely after the information minister had given the statement that "the publication and spreading of the newspaper on any way, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016 the first negotiation took place in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both sentenced to "misuse of public order," abuse of the Internet, "and" malignation of the State of State. "</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of an audience deal and found guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three-year-old penalties and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and fine-penalty of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after being used by the use of a information network to disseminate material that could represent a danger for public order. "</seg>
<seg id="2569">On 22 August 2016, a security deposit of 5000 omic Rial (13000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">On 26 December 2016, the Court of Appeal in a hearing on 26 December 2016, Al-Haj condemned to a year and Al-Maamari sentenced to six months "imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 in conjunction with his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he deprides his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition, the Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of the Information Ministry, to conclude the newspaper "Azamn".</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court, Azamn, the newspaper looks back as far as attacks by the Ottoman government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On January 8, the Minister of Information was issued an order with which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Foreign Affairs personally signed a further statement on which the closing of "Azamn" was renewed for three additional months and giving the Minister for a further time against the decision of the Court of Appeal, to reclaim the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at most recent times the press freedom was violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, for example, the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the discharge of pressure on allibalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country, to cease operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continuous closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalists Al-Haj, the impression that the omic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the freedom of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the Italian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately release and unconditionally released;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the Azamn newspaper, so that their journalists may follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the freedom of freedom in the country</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. under all circumstances ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman may cause their right human rights work unhindered and without fear of reprecautions, including judicial chancers.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, image takes place with his image</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addressed one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need of mediated medical research there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by pharmaceuticals are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists itself, is a major role of research capacities in Africa. major role of science and technology can only be promoting the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for Infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia just when the AIDS epidemic showed first major effects on the national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he investigated the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sampler healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia, and about misunderstanding of media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic National Programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnosis tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only put solutions to have been developed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of the Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get, are often not suitable in our surroundings, and sometimes it is impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, for financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research, which you didn't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory materials is expensive and it will take months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about Science and scientist in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I saw great students all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are demand for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contactating diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa from Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is a limited speed, things to do, and values access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), limited to the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change the world food production.</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com website, a magazine published on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding with the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredgorgeous, the first plant, cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, mortons has been working only through its own objectivity and the question as many sorts of sorts can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more salads were patented, and that he could not yet use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ruffled sheets.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years more such patents have been registered for more plants like cereal or cartel. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists, environmentalists and experts predict food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, morton still continued lettuce, however, however, it is longer necessary because his work is still more constrained by more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's been a rock brocade in a river around which I have to heap." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we must do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "says he." I think that these patents go to Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if it withstand court, no one can regulate a new salads, because all the features are already patched. "he makes so good as possible and tries to recover the characteristics that he would like.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavoured to use a material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined one movement, which is always connected to the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red Römersalat of the sorts of sorts and ate in the "greenhouses" of the station. there will be tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather than sounds as it would come from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Sea Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software which allows alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genic are not protected as the intellectual property, and so it can be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, shortly Ossi, U.S. breeding ground can pledge that other people can be able to use them free for them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow you to cross your seeds, to cross it, and it will not compensate them - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Less outlook outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds indicate that an role in major merges such as biodiversity, rights of the peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter, not only little as having brewaged seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not work on genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who would like to buy good examples of ecological agriculture or not." those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably reproducible vegetables, such as it is offered on peasant markets, should also know that the species is bred and threatens how this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional sovereign in no seed sovereign is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Ased Initiative undertake to make other seed remains freely available. in contrast to this, you can be patented in contrast, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters are argued that the future of food supply is at risk, since the available enjoyment has always been available, because of becoming increasingly unrestricted intellectual property rights.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about one-third of all cartons might be protected as intellectual property, making it not even useable for plant breeders either.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are such estimates yet not yet, but experts like Luby avoids that massaged plants are coated in size as wheat, as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visible</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so farmed that they have not desirable features - of such, which their taste or its colour increase up to such, because they thrive them in certain environments such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents due to plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders are increasingly taking more patents. genetic diversity is currently more needless than ever before, as the changing conditions are worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognize that genetic diversity was generally essential and also decisive for Monsantos's activities. with all four cooperative banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture ministry of the United States, the company set itself for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property has other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant-varied innovations." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these statements help others to come with another method to come to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such a protection inhibits innovations not, but promotes and promotes more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent run strap, surely make no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for such a long time, at plants, which have been adapted to the amended environmental conditions, one would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The basic argument of Morton is that genetic resources always have already been a general good, and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetically anew are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make your work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we do not continue to use the best and newest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes with the concept to patented the plant features: "we do not construct the characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them out and as a breeders we have no idea how the plants do it.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A Secret of Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state, Oregon and Ossi board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who are breeding, breeding also his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Who believes on industrial agriculture with big courts and monocultures, for their growing areas of Herbizide, who are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, there are most smaller seed companies to survive, even without patents - either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden Salata.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders by the Avoid of plant patent would be innovative: "it looks as if I am dealing with my efforts to produce more than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need new material for my catalog as I know that my competitors will sell my sorts in a few years, "says he." with a patent is protected from the competition for 20 years, how to make it pretty simple. "global resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Indeed, the US seem to be leading the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept spreads very quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources, is a "open source" seed producers. the center with farmers work together, helping them to satisfy new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell your own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agreement on an "open source" license which ultimately takes a formal and legally binding form of Ossi-obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding) differ from country to land, as the Ossi obligation cannot be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declares that the conventional plants could not be patentially patrons. thus, they speak against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents to conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, a statement is not yet a law; now it is to governments of the Member States to bring this new line to the governments of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016 the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa to find something about the "Open Source" seeds movement and the world-wide trend for beginners.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for "Open Source" seeds systems that the organization is currently being able to build a worldwide alliance for "open source" seed systems, which should be scheduled for the scheduled year next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Essens - an Verbund from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, who will have the opportunity to exchange seed and improve on seed and improve the seed policy, so that a stable supply can be ensured with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report, the importance of a varied, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection by the Luby von Ossi hoping that soon more people will recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement of regional and ecological food has mostly seen, where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "so Luby." "" "we are trying to clear the people that even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columniest.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend at the 05.August, the Egyptian government shut down the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a position on Facebook in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this stage, and promised to continue work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The same network for Human Rights Information remain in spite of this attack and the Constitution of the Egyptian law and the Constitution in the Arab world, so it was never as difficult to follow these goals, so it was even more important to overcome these goals, so it was not so important to overcome the blocking situation and do not admit. we hope to meet our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first transified website of human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities began more than two months 21 websites, like the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-speaking network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1st Human Rights organization of the wave of wave trap for victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for spreading in Colombia and articles that he did not access the websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he addressed to circumvent the demark apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of aggression.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is home to the also called Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he reported on the students of security in December 2013, while he reported about the students of protests and took a video like the police force physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly to politics and the human rights of human rights in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook review, Ziada expressed the blocking of the government through the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs might not be meaningful for the world, so it is out of two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is possible to give me the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, a tempter murder, forecharge of the national Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other website, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I also wish to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after having blocked him, and they are afraid of words, I can still edit the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muffers go through the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities opened up from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. these include technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by converting Internet Internet Networks and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 June, we discovered how the blocking of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filtering contents on the Egyptian users may have access to filming.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is moreover worsened that the censurns will be hit behind doors, so the Egyptian population has no legal basis because of which they can proceed in court against this actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day a day report newspapers in Brazil with divided headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous Postcards motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot at school," "" "every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was murdered." "" "President Template sends 8500 soldiers of the army, the Navy and the Air Force to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in an annex financial situation in 2017 the greenhouse gas reached the highest rate for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to access the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports such as these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So, the newspaper article published for the detailed submission on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on August 16 the editorarticle "This is not normal," in which they announced to establish a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper stated that the newspaper stated that:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in every big city on the world, including murder, robbery, sexual abuse, etc. everything, however, is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to close journalists not to close our eyes from the grave.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper stated that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of the failure is:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper stated that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories, which will be controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editepic article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We know that a war discourse when it is distorted, also the police may be used, all of the police, which do not delay and then ask questions to deceive.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war, based on information and the struggle against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of Mafia and their partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Shr the name "War" more than it used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, argued that the violence covers a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult, responsible for the police to account.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio even - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, Enlightenment and a historical and self-neglecting of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the Rio de Janeiro state is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">No these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "when we watch the morals per state, Rio is at No.16" "", "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">An extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, emphasises such as Cecília, has been repeated the security policy of the State since years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these safety policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacific ficadora), one of the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a Favela's massive police unit and to stationary a unit permanent there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">Initially, this fact led to a decrease of forcible deaths. for several years, the UPP was intended to protect against vulnerabilities and repression against the poor communities that would actually protect the neo-established police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux wrote from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the force in Rio does not comply with these criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification is in Rio as war also serious consequences for people after itself.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls on the state to carry out the means and ways that are typical for war. it belongs to the territory of a "enemy," where a civil is a sharp point in the countryside and the object for "collateralkeeper" and "verirated balls" becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2787">After the war or her, fact is that the residents of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now that the police attacked the mountain with the Favela Jacozinho in order to avenge the death of a policemen.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident has also been striking: a fruit-eller died following a slabs that had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible war broke out between the various Mujahedin-groupings that defeated the short-lived per-Soviet government. so Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Ghana for the last time with his family at dinner together.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't know it then, she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban came closer to their hatred on the Hazara-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara leaving the land in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after its run, Asharaf found themselves in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coherrube for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage and went into Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towing sacks with mortar who were heavier than he himself to earn his life.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees caught fire and exploitation in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," recen in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan Refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we joined the open window in front of the open window, so that we do not sleep at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf lost his life without the papers in Iran and went up for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous journey to the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome alone and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to support needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">In fact, Italy is true that Italy is relatively high level of irrelevant asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions that apply asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation of the Civil Code in Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special recording centers. they dealt with improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff."</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center, if they have officially put an application for asylum, which may go for months after registration of the asylum seeker.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation have to be paid either to the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it went to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his fierce life, Asharaf helped quickly to liberate these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having made several years of work in the construction industry, Asharaf had gained his total savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that it opened after a while another hostel opened a second hostel.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the theme of "handicapped Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind the Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italian - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Many bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for credits are just a few of obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20.000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghanistan are created by Afghanistan, including tailor, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
