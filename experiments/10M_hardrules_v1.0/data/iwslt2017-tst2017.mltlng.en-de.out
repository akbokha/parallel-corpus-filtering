that is James R@@ isen .
they perhaps know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New @-@ York Times @-@ repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he had no spectacular writing that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astroph@@ ic US secret service operation in which the CIA literally gave literally designs for a atomic bomb .
if the crazy sound , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know , who did not all the chapters about that ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen , and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol to condemn the government for the government , W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and journalists to discuss them .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information , and if they don &apos;t protect the identity of the mu@@ eller you don &apos;t want to add them .
so , when the government had arrived at R@@ isen , he did something what many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters were before him : and he refused , and said that he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 until 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they were many years that it was indisp@@ ens@@ able for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen .
reason : in time electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of fail@@ ures and cr@@ ises to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ steps for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his in@@ compreh@@ ension , concerned his telephone information in home ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , its lending presence , and even travel information with the list of his flights .
in the middle of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ s .
unfortunately this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , the Justice has convicted more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government too much of their work is being secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on National Security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
we therefore put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional rate , because the government has more possibilities to remove all out .
but just like the technology of the government allowed to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can accept that from the moment in which they contact , instead of the re@@ union , in the testimony .
today , there is communication software that had not yet been written to be called R@@ isen , and it is much more secure than a normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source @-@ source system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet world , which has been developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working independently .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with every common contact form .
this will be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the respective message agency .
so the government cannot harm more information secretly , and many of the information that would like it would be available from the out@@ set .
Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century .
unfortunately governments all over the world are increasingly developing new sp@@ y technologies that all end@@ anger ourselves .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that not only technology class such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to keep abuse . it is exactly the most important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
he wants to report about ab@@ uses in the supply of soldiers and reported by over@@ crow@@ ded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to ver@@ t water of Fl@@ int . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
however , these technologies have not only been made to those who want to cover crimes , but to protect against all of the constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data on history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ness . &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; this week we were asked by news about a check of 11 million documents of the Czech law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we will get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers we go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you do that ? &quot;
in fact , we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has re@@ signed .
also , there are reports that an association of brutal Syrian dict@@ ators B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad st@@ roll companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous c@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others , the nerv@@ ous about the next release , and the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ ROM .
it seems wine away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their property in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health , education , roads .
and this is to us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelation are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few , to hide their wealth and to swal@@ low -- something that we discuss in ten years and un@@ veil .
I think many people appears very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always present it as a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ en@@ ppe in front of me .
so one company is in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand , who &apos;s behind these bones .
it may be very difficult to understand the prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what thing is .
I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there was no more famous Americans that occurred in these revelation to this sc@@ and@@ al .
now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle , after which tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , the bag Fon@@ se@@ ca is less American customers .
if we had a lot of data from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples in the USA .
in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some US states to be less information to find a company than to obtain a library swe@@ ep .
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees to absorb school children , school children .
it does not hesitate to zoom particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior , which affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does it work ?
so we sent a discovered investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 public companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator delivered as African minister , who wanted to bring the susp@@ icious money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really felt that all up to an advoc@@ ate of our investig@@ ator proposals , as he could be transferred to the money .
these were all pre@@ sidents . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course there was no eman@@ cip@@ ation to money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about an individual lawyer , who has under@@ sp@@ read@@ mitted to our conce@@ aled suggestions .
it &apos;s not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ oning , wrapped in a sc@@ and@@ al .
it is because the system works through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty , and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this type of behaviour .
this might sound all very often , as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing shall have changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful ones .
but being born , I see precisely that there has been quite a lot to change .
in the past few years we have seen talk to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then the EU has been in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the U.S. hin@@ ds here .
representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama en@@ vel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , as an agent is used to provide for more transparency to the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who w@@ anting to see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ stock companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need exec@@ u@@ tives in the business that rise and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to make sure to end this type of in@@ transparency .
together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I ab@@ duc@@ ted almost and in the boot space of a red Maz@@ das would be .
one day after I completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sales .
one guy in the Red Maz@@ da stopped and looked upon my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was in the city alone and just made a road journey through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep , for tonight ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just didn &apos;t know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I will not kidn@@ apped in the boot space of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h , how long ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night I was in bed , I star@@ red the veil and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken down ?
a wild that sleeps in my living room .
what , if it is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , shot at ti@@ dy pointed to a door , and closed my sleep door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork which he had bought from me is today in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my eye angle .
perhaps the people who were sold out of childhood in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with it .
do we make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ a , my roomm@@ ates and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity is able to create anxi@@ ety in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new roomm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have considered anything to earn . our apartment is a designer @-@ bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website with such a &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they loved it great , and we also loved it .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham and ham tast@@ es completely different because we made them for our guests .
we t@@ oured through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door came into the castle , Mr. Brian and I joined us .
did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time ?
things came into the roll .
my former fellow , n@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ c@@ zy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
so we presented our investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly available pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths . the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
then , over the Internet , they can invite all foreign people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the miss@@ ile would be lit .
but she did not .
no one who is still very good in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all have lear@@ nt that strangers are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one can find yourself on things that you can do . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design much more than just fashion and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience of experience .
we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create confidence through design , between people who never met before .
can design be something like something ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
I would like to give you a sample , which we agreed to so@@ jour@@ n .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will pl@@ uck you out of your comfort .
thum@@ b up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
specify your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this silent aer@@ ob@@ atic flight of pan@@ ic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in their hands ?
most will feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they can stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
so , who is now Al Go@@ res Mobile ?
could you claim on Twitter for the Office of the president ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what would we have been changed to this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had showed once with his name , if he would have told , from whence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments , all say : &quot; it can really hold very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to give your cell phone ?
because a well @-@ thought feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to complete negative impact ass@@ ess@@ ments .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their rights ass@@ ess@@ ments before we set them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we investigated how likely it is that people rely on one another , depending on how they are at age and home .
a little sur@@ pris@@ ingly we trust the people most that are similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we .
this is a natural social respon@@ dence .
it is exciting if you add the call of a person - in our case by Be@@ ur@@ ions .
if you have less than three cases , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes all .
a good call for simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots .
in addition , we drove that confidence is dependent on how much one is of itself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
for example , if you get too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell you how to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ olle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can we create it with design to produce this degree ?
we use the size of the text to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages over strangers .
with which we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than ready to push this pre@@ dat@@ ors .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been bred before .
the shop is very good for us .
of course there is also time , if not everything is smooth .
there were guests that have not allowed parties to have devast@@ ated parties or apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
I worked in customer service at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood on front of the front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it does not harm if I think only about it .
the dis@@ appointment which was list@@ ened to the voice of the c@@ aller , and will always improve our greatest motivation to further improve us .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction .
because people trusted in one another .
when confidence works , you can emer@@ ge .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack there .
his hosts drove him in hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers who tend to heart attack by sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real shel@@ ters who save a life even though they do not know it right .
you enter a car in the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel it , they bring books pass over .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
thus , of course , not every stay expi@@ res .
but this relationship behind the pure money reaction is exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy .
for the first time I stum@@ bled over this term , I asked myself :
what is the thought of the part with money trans@@ actions ?
it &apos;s about a economic trading here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it just now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade to which the human relationships promises .
people insert a part of itself , and that changes all .
when you travel today , it is efficient and reliable with Fast Food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what would be however if travels an extensive buffet from local host@@ esses ?
what if in any place , one would have visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a K@@ nei@@ pen area , of which one has never heard ;
or if one can cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to create apartments from ground to other parts ?
what would that look like ?
what would you have to adopt the idea of joint projects ?
I present to me cities that permit society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ position .
in South Korea , Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces , which belonged to the government ,
were people offered here . students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay ;
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved . incub@@ ator programs were started .
in order to finance new start@@ ups in the Share Economy , over our platform , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be participating with a fore@@ igner or a self @-@ host .
so the idea seems to be crazy about how it was given to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there was similar websites in front of us .
so why just did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deeply ro@@ oting parts .
I think I find it ,
just overwhel@@ m@@ ingly .
I have to think about it , if a red Maz@@ da goes on to me .
of course we know that design cannot fix any problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can see design soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you see me ?
a faithful ? a Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ in@@ ox under@@ go a terror ?
or simply a delay with security check at the airport .
that is indeed true .
don &apos;t give you the debt to your negative impressions .
so the media meet , that look like I .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think the most would not know any Muslims .
presumably , people don &apos;t speak with their hands @-@ drivers .
for all those who have never met any Muslims : it is great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double Esp@@ res@@ so , with cream extra .
I am neg@@ lec@@ ted ,
a se@@ al@@ ant @-@ g@@ inal fan@@ ati@@ cian in ,
and I &apos;m a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslims , Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to have it .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you op@@ pressed yourself ? &quot;
the L@@ ust@@ ed was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist Declaration of Independence , although I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to adapt to me a perfect and easy beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have informed with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought I thought in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship to God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication to deep@@ en the Quran with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes to wines .
I am aware that God knows me . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel the feeling that someone perc@@ eive you completely , and somehow loves it ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineers .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen looking at the end , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; Express . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ades out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical trou@@ bl@@ esho@@ oting ?
my shock turned quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do so ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terror@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only attacked my country but in the N@@ u turned me to susp@@ ect from others by a citizen .
the same day we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate course .
I remember as I drove me -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat , and I feared the first time , when Muslims were recognized .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful in well @-@ illuminated advertising , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not deceived you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims are gathering together .
and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were terrible and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims who stayed in the free and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt right .
because people who had attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I ro@@ gated the rage of people on the terror@@ ists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain it itself .
I have nothing to ask , I love questions .
there are the exc@@ uses which are hard .
today we can listen to people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people do want to join Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States .
it only makes the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor can be removed as a whole and a good tumor under observation .
alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but an essential organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor and teachers , er@@ ron@@ g@@ ous and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closing of mos@@ ques in America ?
there may be a few parking spaces free , but not stop the terror .
regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people other faith toler@@ ant to consider and increased civil involvement .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people will actually be ra@@ dic@@ alised in Mos@@ ques .
they are ra@@ dic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
at the Radi@@ al process , one has found that it is possible to cut the person from their church , even by their family so that the person believes that the person believes , the terror@@ ists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ or her ways and their ide@@ ology is ab@@ h@@ or .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ ization , we must stop people to walk to the mosque .
some will still say , Islam is a violent religion .
after all , there is a group such as the IS their ne@@ sting ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Muslims , as Adam , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group such as the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would like to add ourselves to its creation , if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
the IS had so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u @-@ Kl@@ ux @-@ Kl@@ an Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology reasons on her &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cast a look at her , she does not drive on what she cri@@ es in her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality that they can read these things in the scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because they pre @-@ requested to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , brought them to silence , and told her , that their sense is , their sense to sin in the world , that it would only bring them into trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that their rage would have been given , it was a main target for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation of extrem@@ ists which you spoke a solution .
this im@@ am presented the connection to God and its congregation .
instead of accused of having responded to her rage , he showed her construc@@ tive ways for a true shift in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , they keep to join the IS .
that was an insight , like the Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it work on normal Americans ?
how does it work on every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy off our freedom of freedom ?
one study - actually some neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ ous studies -- show : if we fear ourselves , at least three things happen .
we accept a author@@ itarian government system , conformity and advantages .
a study shows : if one reports test persons in which negative about Muslims were reported , they had more military attacks against Muslim lands and the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
when you look at when the mood against Muslims shot down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this took place three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the lead of the war war and during two elections .
so Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim @-@ terrorism , as I expected it .
it may indeed be a man@@ ipulation of man@@ ipulation to the public in order to under@@ mining the foundation of a free society that has sen@@ sible and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of the fear terri@@ fy us all .
in the assignment of collective debt , it is not just about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was very promising on dental medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the most powerful man who knew her .
she visited him there , and he showed her his cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um . she was sore afraid , saying ,
&quot; when is such a man of my breasts such a di@@ versi@@ fied young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne , her brother and his wife , her offspring , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been in the afternoon . he did it in her flat as in a execution after he posted comments on Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
Fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be in@@ mor@@ ally , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque , or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us there was no light decision because it was because that America would like to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can practice them free of religion .
we chose to the mosque .
with our son in the kinder@@ garten , we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I went out , and moved my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw it left me .
the hall was filled out .
then the im@@ am made a announcement , deliber@@ ate and was welcomed our guests , because the half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , ath@@ eist@@ s , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to teach us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion pan@@ ic and pre@@ emin@@ ence .
what will you choose ?
what are you interested in the moment of anxi@@ ety and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
are you going to go on number ?
or will they join to those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks nice !
Helen W@@ aver : so D@@ alia , you seem to have a ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what do you say that you might say that you &apos;re a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a think of a deep @-@ pass , so an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t feel . I &apos;m completely normal .
I &apos;m not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usually as it is permitted .
when you look on Muslims at all over the world , and I did the world &apos;s largest ever conducted survey on Muslims around the world , people want to normal things .
they want to pro@@ sper@@ ity for the family , they want to work , and they want to live in peace .
so I have no exception in no respect .
if people appear as a rule , then often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thanks a lot . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is about to become one billion business in short time .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutes worldwide .
before air p@@ act enters into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
connecting the flying devices high speed and acceleration to eng@@ th@@ est space .
you can also build a self @-@ load@@ able structures .
you have learned to carry loads with tur@@ bul@@ ences and react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of Pos@@ sible flight in autonomous air .
if a system autonomous works , there must be collec@@ tively know , where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s dem@@ os we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , calculations on board which should do the machine .
external commands are available at the highest egg . e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward plane , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters it can be floating , and thus has great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a flip side .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ cutter is that they react sensitive to tur@@ bul@@ ences like wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn &apos;t matter the optimum position , and the performance can be improved through practice .
okay .
during our research , we often constitute fundamental abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the thing .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand of moving parts , which met themselves to viol@@ ate you .
prior to decades , trained pilots had to fly away , they only had two movable parts : one propeller and a stern .
we discovered that flying with only one works .
that is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented in front of a short term .
it has just a moving part , a propeller ,
no lam@@ b@@ res , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse side , no other recept@@ acle or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechanically simple , the interior happens very much , so it can fly stable and can move in the room .
nevertheless , it is not equipped with the elegant algorithm of the stern . to fly to fly , I must throw it exactly right .
the probability , it is right to throw it all , is small , therefore , I show you a video that was filmed last night .
when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in Gen@@ th@@ fulness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in over@@ flow .
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is not balanced .
therefore he is an ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
as a result he receives the au@@ sibility of the ability ,
in the room to move in all directions , it doesn &apos;t matter which direction it is rotated or even like it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is obvious in models and the rest is under@@ gone directly by flying .
see you this .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other against counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you build it , they are like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong - a motor or propeller falls off , the electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine if fully restricted .
we will show that , by doing more than half of flight .
the last demonstration was examined synthetic war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a selection of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weights less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alis@@ ing technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . there is no upper limit .
hop@@ efully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as the Broadway would like to become a flying lamp on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us is the reward in the development and creative act .
it serves as a memory , as wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it is creative , cle@@ ver bar to form it onto a spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential , is the dot dot on the i .
thank you very much .
almost 1.3 billion years ago , around two black holes per@@ ched in a very far away galax@@ y , and they turned the mass of three star@@ ters in a ten@@ ths of a ten@@ ths of pure energy .
this short moment , they ligh@@ tened light than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big buttons .
they set her energy but not free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was entered into space @-@ time weigh@@ ting himself and explo@@ ded the universe in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1.3 billion years ago , Sever@@ al life was made on earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people , and -- God arise with -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai Weiss decided to build a giant laser detector from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colored black holes .
most of them stopped for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as a mad geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and an extremely hard work they built the detector L@@ IG@@ O : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry &apos;s gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
in the follow @-@ up period the precision of L@@ IG@@ O could be increased significantly , which improved the detection range enorm@@ ously improved .
therefore it is called Advanced L@@ IG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 L@@ IG@@ O was started to clari@@ fy a few smaller , persistent problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves struck the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hug@@ hes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goo@@ db@@ ye to my dead father .
there were basically the fruits of my life .
all this , what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hug@@ hes , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he examined Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through ob@@ serv@@ atories like L@@ IG@@ O mess@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a tra@@ ff@@ ing in the gradient of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its total content will be stretched into one direction and into the other .
for illustr@@ ative do@@ z@@ ers in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity often have no correct impact .
&quot; stretching and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , are ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , everyone was stretched out by us when the waves hit the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ as , followed by a 1 . therefore we declared the L@@ IG@@ O staff for mad@@ ness .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already ab@@ sur@@ d , the length should be measured to less than a thousands of a radius of a nuclear core . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on grav@@ itation
described with K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties of the construction of such detectors are mighty .
but physi@@ cist are er@@ fin@@ alist and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to L@@ IG@@ O . Scott claims that L@@ IG@@ O would be more than one eye than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavelength , which is much smaller than the things around us : fac@@ ial elev@@ ators , the size of your cell phone .
that is quite practical . because you can just@@ ify a picture or map of things by simply perc@@ eive the light of several short@@ coming light around you .
there is different at sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres .
therefore , it is very difficult to be impossible to produce an image of things , which means you especially much :
the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as clay paste and level , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now , Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob dis@@ breaks her . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
the same is for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t use with them no simple pictures of objects in all .
but by having regard to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , the frequencies are at least in the audi@@ ble range for L@@ IG@@ O .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally listen to all literally .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes that my colleague Scott are already busy .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , p@@ atter@@ proof : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional sound change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of movement pattern , shaped to the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 - a date that at least I never forget -- heard L@@ IG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ render &#91; sound &#93; That which he must hear , this is as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which are roughly as fast as the st@@ aves of your mixer .
AA : consider us short what this means .
two black holes , the closest body in all , one with a mass of 29 tons , the other with a weight of 36 so@@ aps , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
this remains the lasting meaning of L@@ IG@@ O .
L@@ IG@@ O is a completely new way to expl@@ oring the universe as she never was possible .
on this path we can listen to the all and hear the invisible .
so we can &apos;t see -- practically or generally -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aged stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . of them we have learned much about the all .
the exciting physical operations take place but at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , as they are op@@ aque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rating iron , as it would be transparent glass . the great . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the ur@@ ine is veil@@ ed by his own neigh@@ bor .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important : I &apos;m optim@@ istic that we have never seen in all things we never saw that we never see and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we just like to listen to .
in fact L@@ IG@@ O was immediately in the first ever run things we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the L@@ IG@@ O project , says to this topic : ME : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as L@@ IG@@ O they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so called the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
L@@ IG@@ O makes us an entirely viewing angle on events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out from that chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ age@@ ous as possible .
thanks L@@ IG@@ O we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and the p@@ ale of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ serv@@ atories - a completely new generation of ob@@ serv@@ atories on the earth and in all .
for what could be beautiful than to listen to the ur@@ ine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
T@@ aming up with us .
thank you .
some times I tried a experiment .
one year long would I go to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I feared .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it nerv@@ ous me , brought me to un@@ pleasant situations , I forcing me to say &quot; Yes &quot; .
wanted I to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted me to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
wanted I to start with the table ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I feared , I prov@@ oked my fear .
my fear to hold spe@@ ech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , gone .
the Power of a Word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons . &quot;
as it was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how , I need milk for my snap@@ shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked them once to play with her when I was just on the go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from here I swear to always to play with them as soon as you do , I am doing . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I &apos;ll always say Yes -- every single times .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m really tired of that .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it was also a promising side effect : just before short , I actually understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ word to play with my children he saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think of things I raised up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I make television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for this to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days ago , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programmes , 70 hours TV , three ship@@ ments , which are simultaneously in production , four episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Added , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 Hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
my TV series work on Thursday night in America on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series have been running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of this 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created themselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ struc@@ tive . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans about wareh@@ ouses and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , which are around the world .
do you know who still makes it ?
no one , therefore I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you because I know what you think , if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who are so hard work if you like a company , a country or household , if you say that I &apos;m not only at the computer at the computer , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that there is not a dream job at a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deeper into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work creates always a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is , when I stood on a canvas , and on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such as dream man a high sound , loves a marathon .
it feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love it to work .
it is cre@@ atively , mechanically , exhau@@ st@@ ily and de@@ pri@@ ved , clin@@ ically and troubled , clin@@ ically and reas@@ on@@ ably sen@@ sible . and best of it , is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when working well .
a sum@@ s start in my head , and it grows and grows like a busy street , and I can drive for ever on it .
many people take it , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I don &apos;t tell them that writing the writing .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- as I began to work and work together with the TV production , when I began to work and work together , I discovered this thing , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than the writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have as a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t go differently than to size .
the feeling , not differently , than to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a workflow .
perhaps there is gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of the failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say you , I am a titanium , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it .
to make a clear : the more successful I will ever more than ever more overcome , more than more items , the more work , the more things more than the same , the more I write history , more than I write history , more expectations are there .
the more I work to have been successful , the more needs to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land that I am weapon , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I &apos;m the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stop .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , expanded .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ ust@@ omed to the truth that their m@@ om is one only worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ om will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; estimates , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
they are the sons of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the sum@@ s of the engine collap@@ sed .
I loved my work no more . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s came not back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ days , completed weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not as@@ le@@ ep , with all your heart , clear eyes what is always .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me there was silence .
four television programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show @-@ to @-@ titanium ,
everything was grey , I just didn &apos;t have fun .
and that was my life .
all that I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
so what does one do , if that , what you do , do the work that you love , suddenly I hate ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ le you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a teacher who knows the sum@@ s when you knew the sum@@ s when sum@@ s up the sum@@ s when sum@@ s up the sum@@ s , who then is going to be ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titanium ?
if the song of my heart stop , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; gives me a question .
I &apos;m in the way outside , late , and she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and second , she called me not &quot; certified . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ valu@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is that happen ?
I hate it when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s came and change everything from my own eyes .
and so , she says : &quot; m@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and j@@ ump@@ ed their sisters , we are laugh@@ ing a lot and I read the very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; before .
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum@@ m@@ ages , can I do nothing but besides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am focusing .
I am silent .
the land that I am weapon , the marathon , I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
all that exists st@@ icky fingers and mo@@ ist kiss@@ es , delicate voices , juni@@ per pins and song , in which it goes wrong , or whatever the girl is released in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and sim@@ plicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly bre@@ athe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
an incre@@ ment@@ ary door goes on and a energy boost is coming in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens to happen .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we forgot .
the sum@@ s that work to titanium dioxide is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I tell me with the help of ship@@ ments and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working specifically .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on the love .
the sum@@ s is the river , which comes from the life of life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ conscious and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which can be done , anticip@@ ation and pressure .
real sum@@ s is simple and originally .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps he whis@@ per@@ ed me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me I will tell Yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can rid me as a work@@ station of any gu@@ ilt .
it &apos;s law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
don &apos;t play me , so how do we work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play .
I always work , because I love it .
I am rather more at the workplace as home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , because what a man works rather than to be home ?
well , I am .
&quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am to me is none of them .
we stayed in the garden , before and back , and from here .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we cr@@ ushed So@@ ap bub@@ bles .
I already feel greater , ab@@ sent and conf@@ used .
I always take mature after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children are showing me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever hear with the games ?
you can also say it ! say they always Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
you may remember me for n@@ ai@@ v , for a diary woman .
you probably have right but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child can be found less interesting as you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me until they don &apos;t want to make something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaces me .
and speaks my teen@@ ager daughter for 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , no longer needs it .
everybody can get 15 minutes on a piece , even in a bad @-@ lay @-@ day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no de@@ fle@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , make children ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well@@ feeling , my world . don &apos;t have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his mind .
it is not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
take a look at the 15 minutes !
find out what good does good .
find out it and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m fail@@ ing and I &apos;ll do . friends meet , books read the day enjoy --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education , when I wanted to sur@@ pass a more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return , if I &apos;m not working .
works do not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door open@@ er , and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fulfil@@ s me and my soul . she direc@@ ts me into new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
soap @-@ bub@@ bles and st@@ icky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but only one part . and therefore I &apos;m so grat@@ eful to that .
it is known to me that I am a Titan bin . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays in Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet , I have everything in the handle . my brain is yet working yet .
the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , I am afraid , the marathon , which I run , the flo@@ ppy walls , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the other , the proper sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , bl@@ asting , naked and new living feeling in me wide . less Titan &apos;s more !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am an author . I think of things I raised up to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this jobs ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amed .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to work and more play .
Titan@@ i have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for us , neuro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very small ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of central nerv@@ ous system the patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
it is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
certainly they have heard from one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ stim@@ ulation &quot; . thereby im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neu@@ rolo@@ gic function improve .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered heavy trem@@ bling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ sur@@ geon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
you can help yourself with some help .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was chief physician and worked in the emergency recording day and night .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mat@@ a the brain occurs and the cran@@ ial pressure is rising .
to save life , you have to reduce the skull of the skull .
for that , sometimes you need to remove a portion of the mass mass .
instead of the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , to analyze the brain mass .
what do I think ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is no easy task .
the cells from a tissue can grow to be comparable to small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments to th@@ ri@@ ve them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François finished .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you can still know from the Bi@@ ological lessons that stem cells are sexually mature , which can transform itself in every cell type of organ@@ ism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small knots of brain .
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made a fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell@@ ular population which looked like ordinary cells , but looked differently .
we needed long to understand how they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
it constitutes 4 % of our large ir@@ rig@@ ation cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why would they get us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we can find them at higher concentrations near brain injury .
but that is not so secure .
one thing is however clear -- of these cells , we received our stem cells .
we stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then to cultiv@@ ate the cells as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they then highlight color to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the decision of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous Tran@@ splantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we im@@ planted the same cells in the brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with no evil monkeys .
in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were removed after some weeks , they would have been removed from home . the room is already busy , they will not need there , so disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof that they show , these little points are . these are the cells that we t@@ ained in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop .
help these cells also help a monkey , to recover from a brain injury ?
thus we trained monkey with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity .
you had to take away food from a tablet .
they did very well .
when they achieved a stable dex@@ ter@@ ity level , we last in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex the hand @-@ eng@@ age range .
as a wise monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could not move their hand more .
just like it would happen with people , they recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover up to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spont@@ aneous re@@ visions , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , which recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we im@@ planted the cells of the cells : the same monkey , two months after the m@@ plantation .
I can say you that were very exciting for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about this cells .
we can use them freeze and later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain has the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure to think several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know som@@ eb@@ ody who can need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely will definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : it is under@@ stand@@ able , the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you go further into the future , how many years it will take to go to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first it depends on the approval of clinical trial .
will we allow the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose the patient to perform treatments and evaluate , whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
one must first show that it is useful before we can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you can tell us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider them as a course .
we don &apos;t see the democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider her as a non @-@ hol@@ iness .
we believe that capitalism was inev@@ it@@ ably leading to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have doubt that it is absolutely possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy remains completely dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally remains .
in fact , the democracy weak@@ ened by us in Europe .
beginning of the year when I re@@ represented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , un@@ am@@ big@@ uous that the democratic process of our country - do not influence the savings programs that were realised in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my local friends who would have repeated to me if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce a economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to believe in collaboration with me that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save us the democracy , but that we need a real and def@@ ensive democracy .
because without democracy , our companies are mil@@ ked , our future is dark and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the issue of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradi@@ ction which is currently threatened with our host .
I call the &quot; twin peaks @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
one summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain , the long sh@@ adows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the Deb@@ t berg ,
but few recognize his Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the real au@@ ster@@ ity and corpor@@ ations , who could bring it there , where it could produce productive up and bring to all the things that human being ur@@ gently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the US , in England and the Eurozone , 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the pro@@ sper@@ ity of manufacturing , such as industrial facilities , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment , and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds after a lot of money until you were compar@@ atively similar to the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing else , except the stock of the stocks and the property prices up@@ loaded .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks that are not equal through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year olds among the United States , Japan and Europe unemployed , which could not invest in a low demand for conc@@ essi@@ vely , these themselves might not be true that his son would kill him when he is growing ,
un@@ rolled the circumstances that leads to it , ensure that est@@ pus him kill him .
this is my Ha@@ ake with capitalism --
his extremely ex@@ cer@@ ative capital , which should be used to improve the in@@ productive capital , develop our lives to finance the human talents , and particularly to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
is Democracy the Solution ?
I think so . but before we continued : what do we understand ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form , where the free and arms are controlling the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ical democracy decided too many of --
women , foreigners , and natural slaves .
it would be a mistake to reduce the score of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these in@@ clusions .
the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was , and it was not only the right to free expression , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but rather important and decisive , which gave them the right to political participation in questions of state c@@ rank@@ ings .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not have long been held --
like a candle that illumin@@ ates very bright , it is also quickly out .
but our current liberal democracy did not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ical democracy concentrated on the free citizen and strengthened the labour , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for ruling .
the liberal democracy had only occurred when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process was im@@ ited to policy , while the economy is the world of corpor@@ ations -- a dem@@ ocrac@@ ies @-@ free zone .
in our present dem@@ ocrac@@ ies since the time , in which this separation between politics and economy began , a her@@ ed@@ itary struggle between the two , under@@ taking the economy gradually immig@@ rants and ma@@ sts .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it lies in fact that one can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separated .
I chose my Ha@@ ake with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about as a herd of smoking , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they feed themselves , that they star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that eman@@ ates politics as far as far . the power of the corpor@@ ations grows itself , political goods will increase , the overall economic demand falls and the management of the corpor@@ ations are forced to invest the cash of their businesses .
the winning of capitalism , the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher will be the twin peaks , and so much the mer@@ ging of human labor power and the wealth of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; ret@@ ains the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Lin@@ ke had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not think well .
the doctrine of Deb@@ ak@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover through a miracle , as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wages paid by automation and rob@@ otic systems .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
we must clean@@ se the economy and again un@@ ite the sectors of the economy and politics , and ensure that we are dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally , otherwise , in a mor@@ ly surveillance system hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ ater that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; can be published as a documentation .
so the question is not whether the achievement of capitalism , which he has brought up , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether the capitalism is similar to capitalism , similar to &quot; Matrix &quot; , or by something that the society in &quot; Star Trek , &quot; will serve people and people to explore their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the Anci@@ ent Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life .
I believe we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Trek , &quot; rather than to have the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ opy ?
in the practical implementation , I want to give you shortly , some examples call .
in the area of the company : please make a capital market in which you have earned money , whilst one company works , and in which your capital is going to you from a company to the next , and the company - no matter what you &apos;re working just -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues come out and the concept of wage work is completely overhau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong the company , but the company does not work to work there , but the company does not belong to those of which the company does not belong . no longer between capital and work , no large g@@ aps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately not at the same twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy : please inform yourself that our national currencies have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
imagine that the entire world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency , we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government paying the sum of the country deficit or the trading income of the country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund invests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment funding are r@@ ar .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not necessary to implement the technical resources .
today , we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world that I call for you is at the same time liber@@ ate , in which they have privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ ist@@ ically because they are buried the separation of capital and work in the rub@@ b@@ ish of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ ze , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ ve .
but above all , it is a world that we can imagine a real democracy .
will we watch in such a world
or are we going to sink an &quot; Matrix &quot; matrix or similar d@@ yst@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how we decide in cooperation with us .
it is in our hands , and we are even more dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Y@@ an@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography more than liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos; analysis today ?
Y@@ an@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do not work that technological development will be such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ize our democracy but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liberal Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am perfectly gl@@ ac@@ eful .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t get more , you don &apos;t think of enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supper of the speakers you have very clear what you can hold from the point of view to China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big level of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracy we have the certificate of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited the democracy in politics , during the area where most of the area plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely dem@@ ocrac@@ ies @-@ free zone .
in certain respect , if I may say the so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles the England of the 19th century .
for -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect to liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
it was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical , as regards the democratic evolution .
what you can do now in China , is similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; China now to throw away what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells fresh to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners were curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half @-@ year after six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view@@ point , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , from the compl@@ ac@@ ency to say goo@@ db@@ ye to b@@ lowing , and to neg@@ le@@ ct that a massive revol@@ ting line went through the euro zone , and continues to shr@@ ink the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity on the basis of Greek pre @-@ sl@@ ags -- the way , the first suggest@@ ion was to reveal this den@@ ial --
sorry it &apos;s right . unfortunately , the ma@@ ids are within the Eurozone , as within the European group , continues to den@@ ying den@@ ying .
but you know , what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to receive an economic system that is not able to get li@@ vi@@ able through political will and authority , it will be accepted for a while , but if the shift occurs , he will ab@@ rupt@@ ly and destroy .
BG : what is you looking for ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any defect in your time as a Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- harvest ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who reports after 6 months in office , especially in a so stressed situation , he claims to have no error , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I have made mist@@ akes .
the greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was a hon@@ our@@ able interest on pages of the AT@@ Ms , to find a common solution .
but this was not .
they only wanted to fall out our government , only because they did not want to deal with the associations that were going to pass through the eu@@ ro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to remember that they have been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
there is no one of the Tro@@ ika of the money that gave us this policy , and said : &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al bug . &quot;
BG : despite all these , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my cr@@ iti@@ que of the European Union and the Eurozone opposite to anyone comes from someone who lives and loves .
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
because if it did not survive , the fli@@ ck@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have a cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences for Europe in cat@@ astroph@@ ic consequences , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we propose ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after which it appears to me , it will also be additionally calculated for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you have to lie wrong in that point .
Y@@ an@@ is , thank you for T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price is never heard by Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entert@@ aining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision to hit the Roy before three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os &quot; .
Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for providing the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard cont@@ ested sector .
there is already so many TV shows that Roy can not choose any of it .
he must find shows , very well , very good .
in other words , he must find shows which are very right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive .
if your show is rated by nine and higher , this will be a winner .
then one has a successful show .
this shows shows how &quot; Break@@ ing Bathroom , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows to make ad@@ dic@@ tive , where , after you have a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there any more from these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should be enough what goes off at this end of the turn .
Roy Price does not worry about to get to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence , to teach &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean emig@@ ration , average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they just in@@ spire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something that &apos;s why Roy wants to ris@@ ky anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes up many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch out for free .
and if Amazon is available for free , don &apos;t sei@@ ze it right ?
millions of spectators are viewing this episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are seen by Roy and his team to record all things .
you capture when you start the show , when you p@@ auses , what parts you ski@@ ps or consider again .
you can collect millions of data in order to decide on these data , which show them should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ Com about four rep@@ ublic@@ ans U.S. trans@@ formers . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember this show , because it was not so good .
it is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 , and Alpha House is at 7.5 -- so something about average , but not just the what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company , another manager has drawn a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he always find the search to find out a super show and he uses it any other way .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team have seen the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews you give the shows , their course they like it etc .
then use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows them like producers , which actors .
when they had together all the parts , they had a venture and decided to do not have a Sit@@ Com about four transmitters , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; house of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x thus landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; receives a 9.1 evaluation on this curve . therefore , exactly there where they wanted .
of course now is the question : what has happened here ?
one has two highly competent , data versi@@ fied companies .
they connect these many data and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
why is this ?
because logic states that it should work above all .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that you hit , you should make a good choice .
it &apos;s 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized through very powerful computer .
the minimum what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work , this is something fri@@ gh@@ tening , because in a time we live more and more statistics , in which we meet more and more statistics , to serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes in contact with this software . come in contact with this software , you are in contact with this software .
if a person is in the USA in jail and ask for unloading , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than to decide whether a show is good or bad , a person will be good or bad .
aver@@ aging television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are created . that &apos;s not what a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google makes mist@@ akes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they could say through data analysis of influenza , the worst kind , predic@@ ts -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news of news . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year round about year , until it did not work anymore .
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand anything .
in spite of all these bugs , data gathered in the decisions of life a -- at the workplace , in the legal implementation , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genet@@ ics -- a sector , where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medicine . over the years , I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ sem@@ inated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you do mainly do two things :
as a first place , put this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the single parts together to hold a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : to go and assemble them again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to rent a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again together , even if the information is incomplete to hold a good conclusion -- especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process .
they are using data to understand how to get their audience better , what else they will not have been able . but the decision to compos@@ e all of these parts , and make it a show how &quot; House of Cards &quot; makes it not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first organized by TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; we say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things work too low if data start to control our decisions .
regardless how powerful it is , data are just a tool , and to forget not , this device is rather useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the result of decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions by using a J@@ a- or no @-@ question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at that moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m going to cut it later with a technique demo .
so far I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life , where I should listen to the ball in the night .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little bit trigger , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
thus perhaps the ball kl@@ ü@@ ger and cle@@ ver and cle@@ ver . ultimately it &apos;s about us to make decisions when we want to reach an extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I sensitive this as a very encour@@ aging message that it &apos;s still pay in spite of the great amount of data always paid , decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks involved .
because at the end , there are not the data , but the risks that you stood at the right end of the curve .
thanks nice .
