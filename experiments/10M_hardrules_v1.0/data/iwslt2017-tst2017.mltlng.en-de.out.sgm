<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They perhaps know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New-York Times-reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he had no spectacular writing that the NSA illegally heard phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation in which the CIA literally gave literally designs for a atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sound, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know, who did not all the chapters about that?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against Risen, and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol to condemn the government for the government, Whistleblower and journalists to discuss them.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information, and if they don't protect the identity of the mueller you don't want to add them.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government had arrived at Risen, he did something what many courageous reporters were before him: and he refused, and said that he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 until 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were many years that it was indispensable for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Reason: in time electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failures and crises to make statements, this could also do his digital footsteps for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his incomprehension, concerned his telephone information in home,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banana information, its lending presence, and even travel information with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the middle of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Riss.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, the Justice has convicted more than all U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government too much of their work is being secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on National Security was the result of that a Whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">We therefore put the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional rate, because the government has more possibilities to remove all out.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the technology of the government allowed to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can accept that from the moment in which they contact, instead of the reunion, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that had not yet been written to be called Risen, and it is much more secure than a normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source-source system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet world, which has been developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working independently.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with every common contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the respective message agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot harm more information secretly, and many of the information that would like it would be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments all over the world are increasingly developing new spy technologies that all endanger ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's worth to ensure that not only technology class such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to keep abuse. it is exactly the most important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">He wants to report about abuses in the supply of soldiers and reported by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to vert water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, these technologies have not only been made to those who want to cover crimes, but to protect against all of the constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data on history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and Mighty] have been hidden in tax havness.] [what does it mean?] this week we were asked by news about a check of 11 million documents of the Czech law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We will get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers we go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you do that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">In fact, we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that an association of brutal Syrian dictators Baschar al-Assad stroll companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others, the nervous about the next release, and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wine away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their property in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this is to us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelation are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few, to hide their wealth and to swallow -- something that we discuss in ten years and unveil.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears very confusing, and it's hard to understand how tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it as a Matrjoschenppe in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company is in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand, who's behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult to understand the prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there was no more famous Americans that occurred in these revelation to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there is no rich Americans that hide their fortune in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which tax havens work, the bag Fonseca is less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a lot of data from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that one needs less information in some US states to be less information to find a company than to obtain a library sweep.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees to absorb school children, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It does not hesitate to zoom particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior, which affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a discovered investigator in the offices of 13 public companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator delivered as African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really felt that all up to an advocate of our investigator proposals, as he could be transferred to the money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all presidents. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course there was no emancipation to money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about an individual lawyer, who has underspreadmitted to our concealed suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politioning, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is because the system works through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty, and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this type of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This might sound all very often, as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing shall have changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful ones.</seg>
<seg id="84">But being born, I see precisely that there has been quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years we have seen talk to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then the EU has been in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the U.S. hinds here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama envelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as an agent is used to provide for more transparency to the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who wanting to see how other people can hide their true identity behind headstock companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the business that rise and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for the business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and to make sure to end this type of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I abducted almost and in the boot space of a red Mazdas would be.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I completed my design studies, I made a backyard sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">One guy in the Red Mazda stopped and looked upon my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was in the city alone and just made a road journey through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">While we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him: "where do you sleep, for tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just didn't know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I will not kidnapped in the boot space of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "h, how long?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was in bed, I starred the veil and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken down?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild that sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What, if it is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, shot at tidy pointed to a door, and closed my sleep door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork which he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my eye angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold out of childhood in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with it.</seg>
<seg id="123">Do we make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plea, my roommates and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity is able to create anxiety in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have considered anything to earn. our apartment is a designer-bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website with such a "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They loved it great, and we also loved it.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham and ham tastes completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door came into the castle, Mr. Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow, nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented our investors: "we want to create a website, on the people publicly available pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths. the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Then, over the Internet, they can invite all foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would be lit.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very good in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learnt that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one can find yourself on things that you can do. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts, we learned that design much more than just fashion and haptics -- it's the overall experience of experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create confidence through design, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be something like something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, which we agreed to sojourn.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will pluck you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Specify your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent aerobatic flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when you open the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in their hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most will feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they can stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So, who is now Al Gores Mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you claim on Twitter for the Office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What would we have been changed to this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had showed once with his name, if he would have told, from whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments, all say: "it can really hold very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you would have to give your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to complete negative impact assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their rights assessments before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We performed with Stanford a study. we investigated how likely it is that people rely on one another, depending on how they are at age and home.</seg>
<seg id="178">A little surprisingly we trust the people most that are similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social respondence.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting if you add the call of a person - in our case by Beurions.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three cases, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes all.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good call for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep roots.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we drove that confidence is dependent on how much one is of itself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">For example, if you get too little, like "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell you how to say," "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- "" "" -- -- the request is rather not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so, there is an optimal degree of openness, such" "" "Tolle" "" "in your apartment! I do with my family vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to produce this degree?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company is based on hope that the right design can help to overcome our advantages over strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than ready to push this predators.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been bred before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there is also time, if not everything is smooth.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests that have not allowed parties to have devastated parties or apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">I worked in customer service at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on front of the front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it does not harm if I think only about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment which was listened to the voice of the caller, and will always improve our greatest motivation to further improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Luckily, the 123 million overnight stays only had a fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, you can emerge.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to heart attack by sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real shelters who save a life even though they do not know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You enter a car in the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel it, they bring books pass over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Thus, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But this relationship behind the pure money reaction is exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">For the first time I stumbled over this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">What is the thought of the part with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about a economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it just now just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade to which the human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People insert a part of itself, and that changes all.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is efficient and reliable with Fast Food. it's efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be however if travels an extensive buffet from local hostesses?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place, one would have visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a Kneipen area, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if one can cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to create apartments from ground to other parts?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would you have to adopt the idea of joint projects?</seg>
<seg id="238">I present to me cities that permit society and relationships, instead of loneliness and deposition.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces, which belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were people offered here. students who were looking for a stay in search of a stay;</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were moved. incubator programs were started.</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new startups in the Share Economy, over our platform, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be participating with a foreigner or a self-host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be crazy about how it was given to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There was similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why just did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooting parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think I find it,</seg>
<seg id="251">Just overwhelmingly.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it, if a red Mazda goes on to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot fix any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "" "" "but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can see design soon." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? a Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brainox undergo a terror?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay with security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">That is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">Don't give you the debt to your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media meet, that look like I.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think the most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably, people don't speak with their hands-drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met any Muslims: it is great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- double Espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am neglected,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant-ginal fanatician in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslims, Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to have it.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends but as Muslims. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusted was: at that time it was a feminist Declaration of Independence, although I felt as 17-year-old felt to adapt to me a perfect and easy beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have informed with the coran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought I thought in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship to God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication to deepen the Quran with each reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik brings me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I am aware that God knows me. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel the feeling that someone perceive you completely, and somehow loves it?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen looking at the end, looked upon the screen and saw the word "Express."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spades out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical troubleshooting?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "..." ""... "in the name of Islam,..." ""... "jihad..." ""... "..." ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only attacked my country but in the Nu turned me to suspect from others by a citizen.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Middle West of the United States to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as I drove me -- as we were silent -- so deep it went in my seat, and I feared the first time, when Muslims were recognized.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then, I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "Be careful," "" "be careful in well-illuminated advertising," "" "are not deceived you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims are gathering together.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again, the warnings: "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were terrible and I heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who stayed for Muslims who stayed in the free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country, have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I rogated the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain it itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to ask, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the excuses which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can listen to people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people do want to join Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only makes the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor can be removed as a whole and a good tumor under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">Alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but an essential organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teachers, errongous and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques in America?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces free, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people other faith tolerant to consider and increased civil involvement.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people will actually be radicalised in Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">At the Radial process, one has found that it is possible to cut the person from their church, even by their family so that the person believes that the person believes, the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhor her ways and their ideology is abhor.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to walk to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still say, Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">After all, there is a group such as the IS their nesting ality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslims, as Adam, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group such as the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">"" "" "" "but we would like to add ourselves to its creation, if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers." ""</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS had so much to do with Islam, such as the Ku-Klux-Klan Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on her "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "" "" "but if one cast a look at her, she does not drive on what she cries in her" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality that they can read these things in the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they pre-requested to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, brought them to silence, and told her, that their sense is, their sense to sin in the world, that it would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that their rage would have been given, it was a main target for the instrumentalisation of extremists which you spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam presented the connection to God and its congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accused of having responded to her rage, he showed her constructive ways for a true shift in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, they keep to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight, like the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it work on normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it work on every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day to our democracy off our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study - actually some neuroscientious studies -- show: if we fear ourselves, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and advantages.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one reports test persons in which negative about Muslims were reported, they had more military attacks against Muslim lands and the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when the mood against Muslims shot down -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this took place three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the lead of the war war and during two elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim-terrorism, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It may indeed be a manipulation of manipulation to the public in order to undermining the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of the fear terrify us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt, it is not just about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was very promising on dental medicine, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the most powerful man who knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and he showed her his curriculum. she was sore afraid, saying,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a man of my breasts such a diversified young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne, her brother and his wife, her offspring, Craig Stephen Hicks, was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been in the afternoon. he did it in her flat as in a execution after he posted comments on Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be inmorally, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque, or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us there was no light decision because it was because that America would like to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can practice them free of religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the kindergarten, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I went out, and moved my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw it left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was filled out.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the imam made a announcement, deliberate and was welcomed our guests, because the half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to teach us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion panic and preeminence.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you interested in the moment of anxiety and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will they join to those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Waver: so Dalia, you seem to have a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you might say that you're a TEDTalk, a think of a deep-pass, so an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say you don't feel. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I'm not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so usually as it is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look on Muslims at all over the world, and I did the world's largest ever conducted survey on Muslims around the world, people want to normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want to prosperity for the family, they want to work, and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I have no exception in no respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as a rule, then often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thanks a lot. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters, is about to become one billion business in short time.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutes worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air pact enters into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting the flying devices high speed and acceleration to engthest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build a self-loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to carry loads with turbulences and react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of Possible flight in autonomous air.</seg>
<seg id="415">If a system autonomous works, there must be collectively know, where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, calculations on board which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available at the highest egg. e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward plane, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters it can be floating, and thus has great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgecutter is that they react sensitive to turbulences like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight machine doesn't matter the optimum position, and the performance can be improved through practice.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often constitute fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the thing.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with a thousand of moving parts, which met themselves to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Prior to decades, trained pilots had to fly away, they only had two movable parts: one propeller and a stern.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">That is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented in front of a short term.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has just a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No lambres, hinges and transverse side, no other receptacle or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the interior happens very much, so it can fly stable and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it is not equipped with the elegant algorithm of the stern. to fly to fly, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability, it is right to throw it all, is small, therefore, I show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monospinner is a practice in Genthfulness, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in overflow.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not balanced.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is an ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result he receives the ausibility of the ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">In the room to move in all directions, it doesn't matter which direction it is rotated or even like it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is obvious in models and the rest is undergone directly by flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">See you this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build it, they are like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong - a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery - can continue to fly the machine if fully restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will show that, by doing more than half of flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic warms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a selection of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weights less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localising technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as the Broadway would like to become a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, as wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it is creative, clever bar to form it onto a spectacular fashion.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential, is the dot dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">Almost 1.3 billion years ago, around two black holes perched in a very far away galaxy, and they turned the mass of three starters in a tenths of a tenths of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, they lightened light than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big buttons.</seg>
<seg id="472">They set her energy but not free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was entered into space-time weighting himself and exploded the universe in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, Several life was made on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people, and -- God arise with -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a giant laser detector from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colored black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as a mad geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and an extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometry's gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period the precision of LIGO could be increased significantly, which improved the detection range enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started to clarify a few smaller, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves struck the two collious black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my dead father.</seg>
<seg id="491">There were basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he examined Gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatories like LIGO messable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational shaft is a traffing in the gradient of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its total content will be stretched into one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative dozers in courses for the theory of relativity often have no correct impact.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, everyone was stretched out by us when the waves hit the waves. the elongation of an average people was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the commas, followed by a 1. therefore we declared the LIGO staff for madness.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, the length should be measured to less than a thousands of a radius of a nuclear core. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described with KIP Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for waves like this: "the technical difficulties of the construction of such detectors are mighty.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicist are erfinalist and with the support of the public will be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO would be more than one eye than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial elevators, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite practical. because you can justify a picture or map of things by simply perceive the light of several shortcoming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">There is different at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult to be impossible to produce an image of things, which means you especially much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as clay paste and level, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob disbreaks her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't use with them no simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by having regard to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, the frequencies are at least in the audible range for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can literally listen to all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes that my colleague Scott are already busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, patterproof: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, you hear the same cirpen with an additional sound change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement pattern, shaped to the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 - a date that at least I never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrender [sound] That which he must hear, this is as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which are roughly as fast as the staves of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: consider us short what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the closest body in all, one with a mass of 29 tons, the other with a weight of 36 soaps, revolve one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This remains the lasting meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO is a completely new way to exploring the universe as she never was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">So we can't see -- practically or generally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaged stars explode in super novae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned much about the all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical operations take place but at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, as they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrating iron, as it would be transparent glass. the great. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the urine is veiled by his own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important: I'm optimistic that we have never seen in all things we never saw that we never see and of which we don't have any idea. things we just like to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO was immediately in the first ever run things we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as LIGO they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so called the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO makes us an entirely viewing angle on events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out from that chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and the pale of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a completely new generation of observatories on the earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Taming up with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some times I tried a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">One year long would I go to everything "Yes!" I was afraid of which I feared.</seg>
<seg id="556">It doesn't matter whether it nervous me, brought me to unpleasant situations, I forcing me to say "Yes".</seg>

<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted me to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted I to start with the table?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, I provoked my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to hold speeches, my social fear -- Puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The Power of a Word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," I changed.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons. "</seg>

<seg id="572">"" "she asked them once to play with her when I was just on the go." "" "and I said," "" "yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from here I swear to always to play with them as soon as you do, I am doing. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I'll always say Yes -- every single times.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm really tired of that.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it was also a promising side effect: just before short, I actually understood that the "Yes" -word to play with my children he saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think of things I raised up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I make television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for this to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days ago, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four television programmes, 70 hours TV, three shipments, which are simultaneously in production, four episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Added, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 Hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">My TV series work on Thursday night in America on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series have been running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of this 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created themselves, and not only produced, so still obstructive. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans about warehouses and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires, which are around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I tell you because I know what you think, if the word" "" "author" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who are so hard work if you like a company, a country or household, if you say that I'm not only at the computer at the computer, and it's true when I say: I understand that there is not a dream job at a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deeper into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates always a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "it is, when I stood on a canvas, and on a canvas." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="608">Such as dream man a high sound, loves a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love it to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creatively, mechanically, exhaustily and deprived, clinically and troubled, clinically and reasonably sensible. and best of it, is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums start in my head, and it grows and grows like a busy street, and I can drive for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take it, if I tell them the sums that I don't tell them that writing the writing.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- as I began to work and work together with the TV production, when I began to work and work together, I discovered this thing, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than the writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have as a sums, you can't go differently than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not differently, than to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workflow.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps there is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of the failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say you, I am a titanium, and I know that I don't want to ask it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will ever more than ever more overcome, more than more items, the more work, the more things more than the same, the more I write history, more than I write history, more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to have been successful, the more needs to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land that I am weapon, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I'm the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stop.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, expanded.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is one only worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "estimates, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the sons of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titanen.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work no more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-days, completed weekends, no Reue, nothing to delegate, a titanium is not asleep, with all your heart, clear eyes what is always.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me there was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-to-titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just didn't have fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All that I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what does one do, if that, what you do, do the work that you love, suddenly I hate?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some think:" "" "Heule you," "" "the author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you're doing it, you're doing what you're doing to be a teacher, a teacher who knows the sums when you knew the sums when sums up the sums when sums up the sums, who then is going to be?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stop, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waitress" gives me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">I'm in the way outside, late, and she says: "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and second, she called me not "certified."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no more" "" "Evaluate" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I am Titan bin and my sums came and change everything from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so, she says: "mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and jumped their sisters, we are laughing a lot and I read the very dramatic from the book "Everybody Poops" before.</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"" "" "" "but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the summages, can I do nothing but besides." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focusing.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land that I am weapon, the marathon, I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, juniper pins and song, in which it goes wrong, or whatever the girl is released in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">An incrementary door goes on and a energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens to happen.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums that work to titanium dioxide is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I tell me with the help of shipments and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working specifically.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river, which comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-conscious and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, which can be done, anticipation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">Real sums is simple and originally.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps he whispered me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will tell Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can rid me as a workstation of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Don't play me, so how do we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am rather more at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, because what a man works rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I am.</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am to me is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We stayed in the garden, before and back, and from here.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed Soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I already feel greater, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take mature after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>

<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever hear with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say they always Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">You may remember me for naiv, for a diary woman.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child can be found less interesting as you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at the most 15 minutes with me until they don't want to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speaks my teenager daughter for 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>

<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="778">It is known to me that I am a Titan bin. I've never seen a Titan who plays in Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>

<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, blasting, naked and new living feeling in me wide. less Titan's more!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am an author. I think of things I raised up to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this jobs,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamed.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to work and more play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titani have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us, neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of central nervous system the patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">It is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard from one of the most famous, the "deep-stimulation". thereby implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurologic function improve.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered heavy trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">You can help yourself with some help.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was chief physician and worked in the emergency recording day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumata the brain occurs and the cranial pressure is rising.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For that, sometimes you need to remove a portion of the mass mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I think?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">The cells from a tissue can grow to be comparable to small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François finished.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you can still know from the Biological lessons that stem cells are sexually mature, which can transform itself in every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small knots of brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided themselves slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cellular population which looked like ordinary cells, but looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand how they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">It constitutes 4% of our large irrigation cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why would they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we can find them at higher concentrations near brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- of these cells, we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand before a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then to cultivate the cells as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then highlight color to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted them at the decision of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we implanted the same cells in the brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with no evil monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were removed after some weeks, they would have been removed from home. the room is already busy, they will not need there, so disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show, these little points are. these are the cells that we tained in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey, to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">Thus we trained monkey with a manual dexterity.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take away food from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they achieved a stable dexterity level, we last in the motoric cortex the hand-engage range.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a wise monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just like it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover up to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous revisions, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we implanted the cells of the cells: the same monkey, two months after the mplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can say you that were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about this cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freeze and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain has the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="885">I definitely will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you need to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you go further into the future, how many years it will take to go to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will we allow the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose the patient to perform treatments and evaluate, whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One must first show that it is useful before we can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>

<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider them as a course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see the democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider her as a non-holiness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism was inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have doubt that it is absolutely possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy remains completely democratically remains.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, the democracy weakened by us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">Beginning of the year when I rerepresented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, unambiguous that the democratic process of our country - do not influence the savings programs that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my local friends who would have repeated to me if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce a economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in collaboration with me that Lee Kuan Yew, Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save us the democracy, but that we need a real and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy, our companies are milked, our future is dark and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the issue of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which is currently threatened with our host.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call the "twin peaks-Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain, the long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the Debt berg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the real austerity and corporations, who could bring it there, where it could produce productive up and bring to all the things that human being urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the US, in England and the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of manufacturing, such as industrial facilities, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds after a lot of money until you were comparatively similar to the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing else, except the stock of the stocks and the property prices uploaded.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital are the twin peaks that are not equal through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year olds among the United States, Japan and Europe unemployed, which could not invest in a low demand for concessively, these themselves might not be true that his son would kill him when he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unrolled the circumstances that leads to it, ensure that estpus him kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Haake with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely excerative capital, which should be used to improve the inproductive capital, develop our lives to finance the human talents, and particularly to finance the technologies, "green" technologies, which are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is Democracy the Solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continued: what do we understand?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, where the free and arms are controlling the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenical democracy decided too many of --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and natural slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">It would be a mistake to reduce the score of the athenical democracy due to these inclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the Athenical democracy was, and it was not only the right to free expression, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but rather important and decisive, which gave them the right to political participation in questions of state crankings.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not have long been held --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that illuminates very bright, it is also quickly out.</seg>
<seg id="937">But our current liberal democracy did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenical democracy concentrated on the free citizen and strengthened the labour, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy had only occurred when a complete separation of politics and economy are possible and the democratic process was imited to policy, while the economy is the world of corporations -- a democracies-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies since the time, in which this separation between politics and economy began, a hereditary struggle between the two, undertaking the economy gradually immigrants and masts.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It lies in fact that one can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power because the power of politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I chose my Haake with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about as a herd of smoking, which so sustainably the animals, of which they feed themselves, that they starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that emanates politics as far as far. the power of the corporations grows itself, political goods will increase, the overall economic demand falls and the management of the corporations are forced to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The winning of capitalism, the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher will be the twin peaks, and so much the merging of human labor power and the wealth of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" retains the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Linke had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not think well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of Debakel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only recover through a miracle, as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wages paid by automation and robotic systems.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">We must cleanse the economy and again unite the sectors of the economy and politics, and ensure that we are democratically democratically, otherwise, in a morly surveillance system hyperautocrater that lets the film "Matrix" can be published as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether the achievement of capitalism, which he has brought up, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether the capitalism is similar to capitalism, similar to "Matrix", or by something that the society in "Star Trek," will serve people and people to explore their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the Ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek," rather than to have the "Matrix" similar dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation, I want to give you shortly, some examples call.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please make a capital market in which you have earned money, whilst one company works, and in which your capital is going to you from a company to the next, and the company - no matter what you're working just -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and revenues come out and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong the company, but the company does not work to work there, but the company does not belong to those of which the company does not belong. no longer between capital and work, no large gaps between investment and donors, and ultimately not at the same twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please inform yourself that our national currencies have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency, we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" '-- and every government paying the sum of the country deficit or the trading income of the country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment funding are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not necessary to implement the technical resources.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I call for you is at the same time liberate, in which they have privileged persons, and marxistically because they are buried the separation of capital and work in the rubbish of history, and keynesize, global keynesive.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world that we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we watch in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to sink an "Matrix" matrix or similar dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide in cooperation with us.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we are even more democratically democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography more than liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx 'analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do not work that technological development will be such a massive decline in overall economic demand, which Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracy but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, therefore I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am perfectly glaceful.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't get more, you don't think of enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at supper of the speakers you have very clear what you can hold from the point of view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Do you want to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big level of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracy we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited the democracy in politics, during the area where most of the area plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democracies-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In certain respect, if I may say the so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- Do you remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism with democracy -- this is an error.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">It was especially skeptical, as regards the democratic evolution.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can do now in China, is similar to the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "China now to throw away what the West has done in the 19th century, smells fresh to hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious about your experiences as the finance minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back on the first half-year after six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal viewpoint, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, from the complacency to say goodbye to blowing, and to neglect that a massive revolting line went through the euro zone, and continues to shrink the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of Greek pre-slags -- the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Sorry it's right. unfortunately, the maids are within the Eurozone, as within the European group, continues to denying denying.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know, what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to receive an economic system that is not able to get liviable through political will and authority, it will be accepted for a while, but if the shift occurs, he will abruptly and destroy.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what is you looking for?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any defect in your time as a Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- harvest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who reports after 6 months in office, especially in a so stressed situation, he claims to have no error, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I have made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was a honourable interest on pages of the ATMs, to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to fall out our government, only because they did not want to deal with the associations that were going to pass through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to remember that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">There is no one of the Troika of the money that gave us this policy, and said: "this was a colossal bug."</seg>

<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My critique of the European Union and the Eurozone opposite to anyone comes from someone who lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Because if it did not survive, the flickers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have a catastrophic consequences for Europe in catastrophic consequences, but for the entire global economy.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Roy Price is never heard by Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision to hit the Roy before three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slender, a Igelfrisur and describes herself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos".</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because it is responsible for providing the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard contested sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There is already so many TV shows that Roy can not choose any of it.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, very well, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows which are very right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation division of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated by nine and higher, this will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">This shows shows how "Breaking Bathroom," "The Wire" -- all the shows to make addictive, where, after you have a season, your brain asks, "Where is there any more from these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows how "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should be enough what goes off at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about to get to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence, to teach "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean emigration, average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they just inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something that's why Roy wants to risky anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes up many ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch out for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is available for free, don't seize it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are viewing this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are seen by Roy and his team to record all things.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show, when you pauses, what parts you skips or consider again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You can collect millions of data in order to decide on these data, which show them should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a SitCom about four republicans U.S. transformers."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "alpha House," but it seems that not many of them can remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4, and Alpha House is at 7.5 -- so something about average, but not just the what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company, another manager has drawn a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he always find the search to find out a super show and he uses it any other way.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team have seen the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews you give the shows, their course they like it etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows them like producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had together all the parts, they had a venture and decided to do not have a SitCom about four transmitters, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "house of Cards". Netflix thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" receives a 9.1 evaluation on this curve. therefore, exactly there where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course now is the question: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two highly competent, data versified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic states that it should work above all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that you hit, you should make a good choice.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It's 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, this is something frightening, because in a time we live more and more statistics, in which we meet more and more statistics, to serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes in contact with this software. come in contact with this software, you are in contact with this software.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If a person is in the USA in jail and ask for unloading, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than to decide whether a show is good or bad, a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Averaging television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. that's not what a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they could say through data analysis of influenza, the worst kind, predicts -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news of news. the success culminated in a publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year round about year, until it did not work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these bugs, data gathered in the decisions of life a -- at the workplace, in the legal implementation, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- a sector, where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years, I recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first place, put this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the single parts together to hold a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: to go and assemble them again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to rent a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again together, even if the information is incomplete to hold a good conclusion -- especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They are using data to understand how to get their audience better, what else they will not have been able. but the decision to compose all of these parts, and make it a show how "House of Cards" makes it not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first organized by TV ideas, then as they chose "alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "we say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I believe that things work too low if data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Regardless how powerful it is, data are just a tool, and to forget not, this device is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the result of decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" Magic 8 Ball "" "." it is amazing. for decisions by using a Ja- or no-question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "" "" most likely "" "" -- exactly here at that moment. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'm going to cut it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I've met some decisions in my life, where I should listen to the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a little bit trigger, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Thus perhaps the ball klüger and clever and clever. ultimately it's about us to make decisions when we want to reach an extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I sensitive this as a very encouraging message that it's still pay in spite of the great amount of data always paid, decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end, there are not the data, but the risks that you stood at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
