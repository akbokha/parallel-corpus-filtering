Munich 1856 : four cards that change your views on the city
a w@@ ander age , where you@@ ths are supposed to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is dug for the tunnel tun@@ nels .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the unique reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich delivers exciting stories to days .
it nerv@@ es when maps are not current .
this knows everyone who had to be off@@ ended up because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the new Bayern Atl@@ antique , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State government , are all other than current - but is therefore very reve@@ aling .
especially when you compare it with current online card .
then it is clear how the cities and communities in the area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ eted carpet , one recogni@@ zes as such as such .
the great postcard map were collected for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ gence sheets .
this originated according to the Bavarian Ministry of Measurement between 1810 and 1864 and the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French troop occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wish an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course to military purposes .
even when French troops were finally removed from the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 1801 : the idea of today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of a widespread Bavaria card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian settlement management .
the origin for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library .
in comparison Spring / Today the state capital is most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown rapidly .
one example is an send@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the establishment of the map , i.e. 1877 , capital of Munich .
today sub@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ scriptions are concentrated around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bavarian farmer against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can &apos;t see anything as fields - at first glance : in the illustrated map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &apos; Ur@@ al , &quot; which was derived from the property tax .
small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of sub @-@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , which was the place of October 1810 , was in the 19th century , actually a meadow and no concrete desert .
at the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map shows an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the case of origin , in the territory of this district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , are not only the street name &quot; at the guest appearances &quot; or of the height &quot; At the fan &quot; - but also in big letters . &quot;
yes , here on the auction field you once opened people with honey@@ s .
in 1858 / 59 , the Munich club @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was produced &quot; At the Au@@ er fan . &quot;
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den initiated the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who had been killed in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; it was progressive for its time and did not end the so @-@ called mer@@ it of the so @-@ called .
in addition , he under@@ goes to the staff , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients first place was first , and later on 500 seats was extended .
sometime , this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ ees in hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum , Munich @-@ East Germany since 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist .
at the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Munich &apos;s sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order took the building complex in 1920 and turned him into a youth home with vocational training .
West is the football pitch of TS@@ V Munich east , east of home from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; erected in architectural re@@ jection of the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ ees , which had been destroyed during WW@@ II during WW@@ II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was located around 1856 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke down many holes in the city in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a greetings from the Middle Ages were once to work at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days work on and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking point for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der lets you compare the old Munich @-@ card with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
patri@@ mon@@ ary group publishes it@@ iner@@ ary for Missouri
the National Association for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to the state after dis@@ sent@@ ing politics and rac@@ ial attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri , which will take effect until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , because a number of frag@@ ment losses incur@@ red in the entire state and notice that it is stated in the opinion of the Group .
a recently revised law of Missouri , which makes people serious , discri@@ min@@ ate discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate the group , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately release the group , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; they have violations of the rights to pass through people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they will be attached or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such an incidence that we haven &apos;t heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group cited incid@@ ents such as rac@@ ist violation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died at the beginning of the year , after that during the voyage through the state no more fuel had , and by the police of Missouri was accused of being accused of being accused .
the Council also shows a recent report by the office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office , which is shown that black motor@@ ists will be more likely in the state 75 per cent more common than the White .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; people must be willing to bring whether it will bring down payment or to know the relatives they are going through the state . &quot;
Missouri was able to break out 100 Hass@@ elt in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the crime @-@ crime programme of the FB@@ I , which state the state in regards to the number of such violations in the 16th rank of the country .
the it@@ iner@@ ary is also a response to a new Missouri law which would be more difficult to compl@@ ain a company for residence or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ et Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel agreements for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immig@@ ration authorities to commit people to forgive men because of immig@@ ration agreements , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ L@@ U for further rein@@ forcement .
travel agreements are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but at the last time , stak@@ eholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
electric f@@ encing project is Elem@@ ent@@ ar
the fisher@@ man &apos;s electric fence project is a success project and is continuing in the coming year .
the CDU Bundest@@ ag@@ s@@ led Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
in the case of the excav@@ ation of the family of Schwen@@ k@@ ann met representatives of the CDU Area association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ k@@ ann offers in@@ sights into operation in which he managed to cultiv@@ ate 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as many young k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five homes Feri@@ eng@@ es .
the Black Forest milk &quot; is an alternative to the alternative to the milk of its cows , so swi@@ v@@ elled in the milk of his cows .
on the table of the Feri@@ heg@@ y , only regional .
since he is also the BL@@ HV Chairman of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach , he called the &quot; Elem@@ ental Project as &quot; Elem@@ ent@@ ar . &quot;
I can &apos;t profit margin on such steep areas .
the green land care for a lot of work , much to be mach@@ ined by the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have to fight here with the terms and the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Val@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and transferred this without chemical plant protection and fertil@@ ization , even if it doesn &apos;t lead a bio @-@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the community has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy about the leader funding . &quot;
with costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers should have to be supported .
one hope that it could be pulled out for a while still a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor .
the farmers are often found in criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013 .
the dis@@ closure of the area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed until at least 2023 .
the total cost of the commune of Fisch@@ erb@@ ach was funded by the total costs of 71 500 million .
consequently the farmers had to invest € 12 million , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained an@@ gling .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and landscapes . &quot;
Peter White stand for Peter White : &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state funding of f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the presence of the presence of the L@@ PR signed by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the un@@ tough area must not be infl@@ am@@ per@@ ated ( slope of 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the collection .
a total of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 km of fence at the beginning of the year 2018 .
the re@@ tention area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty .
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans will appreciate the same as every other - therefore the fatal fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key Ide@@ ologist of the Tr@@ ump @-@ reg@@ imes , knew what he did when he had a symbolic e in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the suggestions of the president to dra@@ stic immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller took not the statue itself .
a Hor@@ de of Bo@@ af@@ ers and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators had sought him when he had done it .
but he took their significance , and in particular the meaning that all of you had been attributed to the famous po@@ em by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his basis was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta recorded a complete thing about history , I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing over history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the po@@ em which you refer to , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ec@@ tively correct but how he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the r@@ aging words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immig@@ rants , but the p@@ oo@@ rest of the poor : &quot; your we@@ d@@ ances , your poor , and your poor crow@@ ds to bre@@ athe yourself , and to bre@@ athe out free on your coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apost@@ asy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not eng@@ age in literary criticism - he clearly revealed that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps are not welcome .
this conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who were willing to use their words to their death in the base - knew very good that they had finished a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and amer@@ ican rep@@ ublic@@ s by giving it in a ab@@ used classic depic@@ tion depic@@ ting the female em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the freedom .
Lazarus changed this significance : in her po@@ em is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and in itself there is a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the po@@ em with the picture is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the US native vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time .
the great cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty was pointed , but rather a early neo @-@ conservative , the American flame goes into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes out .
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch is not to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual , lim@@ ber@@ gh left here to a bit .
the significance of the statue is entirely and even a matter of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus has existed in it to see how they had seen from the exhau@@ sted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble travels to the deck@@ s of ships .
it is in the true sense that the world from perspective of people to see the refuge and improve their chance to improve their lives .
her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .
and this is of course not the perspective with Miller and Tr@@ ump .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine forth the way , but the hat@@ red that is their only source of power is ign@@ ited .
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aders Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Britain
the performance director of the Field Athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the world championship &quot; becomes a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , starting on Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland becomes something special &quot; in Scotland , &quot; and the athlet@@ ics of the United Kingdom have to learn from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand , and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athlet@@ ics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of the circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m trail while Eil@@ id@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team @-@ Captain by the team .
&quot; Eil@@ id@@ h is fairly modest .
their capit@@ als &quot; speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ated .
the passion and the real feeling that Eil@@ id@@ h was completely in@@ naturally , was great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of Silver medal for the fifth World Championships on the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sc@@ ots are in the British team .
the best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle cross@@ wise Mu@@ ir leads on this path and in the last year five British and two European records .
it is going to be at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , one after a great season , who was looking for victory in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships , when the only two bass@@ o@@ ons in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the Mann@@ ers capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men did not only belong to the team , but in some cases also the medals and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing to his team &apos;s surrender , is that they voted by the other members of the team , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all those that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes born to Po@@ dien .
what my speech is subject to chapters ?
yes , I think it was good .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship .
it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are again at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it &apos;s just like to be a great atmosphere there outside . &quot;
block@@ ers from critics on Facebook : don &apos;t get a public ministry if you do not bear the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from the domestic policy to its political principles .
he sch@@ im@@ ated in the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 1783 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and dum@@ b we will be led like the sheep for battles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Govern@@ or Larry H@@ og@@ an who wants to work out more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil War Union was accused him therefore in the beginning of this week .
the staff of the governor won the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ utions , and the online commentary was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a type such as H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can Govern@@ or in a stunning democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary measure .
he has shown a strong hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a prim@@ itive means to connect to his voters and de@@ compos@@ e his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that will be officially designated and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessary and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ ended H@@ og@@ an spokes@@ person Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the reviews of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too simple to use the image of trol@@ ls or sp@@ ears or h@@ ass@@ aul@@ ted people running online .
the post spoke with some of the actual people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and that only real people speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no role .
they all told that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , proven and not professional .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and app@@ eals to H@@ og@@ an &apos;s Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney at Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ fully met , but she asked to hate Hass@@ elt .
&quot; I commented at pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on Hass@@ elt and another current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think this idea too , if a number of people on the same topic , then they will be affected by some more than a so @-@ called collective labor and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the employees of the govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; would others call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by removing a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers , and to burn newspapers , or remove demonstr@@ ators or to make it swe@@ ating .
but that &apos;s just what has just happened .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants that critic@@ ises that he has imp@@ lied on Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County promised the First A@@ men@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she was named a voters of its Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Govern@@ or Matt Before ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplier between 1776 and 1800 , and an anonymous letter driver beat on his leadership .
even at that time , Washington had an anonymous role .
the people , the pseud@@ onym@@ s , such as &quot; lawyer , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made aware of Washington .
pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ised its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the UK industry critic@@ ized his office , according to the historical documents , which were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put it to silence .
freedom of freedom , freedom of expression and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty , hop@@ ing for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days of local comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the links to the du@@ chy in the past year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is to be connected to the new venue as the tournament ambassador in the name of the association and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame in this event , &quot; said Raphael .
&quot; players will see this course from his best page , he is in a great condition .
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is an e@@ ager@@ ly advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time although he won in his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player found in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I won &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it won in 2014 after I had won it out of the program .
back to that part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon who last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European senior tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the home on home .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance at the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you &apos;ll feel the additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how much has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio of the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior major champ@@ ions Paul Bro@@ dh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ am .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six sc@@ ot@@ tos in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants .
all revenues go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
researchers at the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Clinic ( U@@ KE ) are involved in this result .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer were attributable to passi@@ v@@ smoking &quot; and &quot; she said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hei@@ ko Becher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved his own study on this topic in 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 mon@@ ks of lung cancer due to passive smoking a year .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections are considered a complex
the construction works in Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lie reas@@ on@@ ably in time , &quot; so the ladder of the Fred Hein@@ ze station .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than thought , as in the substr@@ ate much ver@@ ts , which does not notice in the plans .
the traffic , which imp@@ airs the construction works again , represents a big problem for the construction ru@@ in of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignor@@ ance of motor@@ ists from red lights and shut@@ dow@@ ry is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the liner buses be eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z by the company St@@ ump@@ p are busy with the work on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite beautiful .
but fortunately we were powered by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Kost@@ or@@ z .

it is a rare insight into the everyday life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia than just 1,0@@ 26 elders to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement that touched the independence against the Dutch rule , turned back against the government of Jakarta who manages the control of the region and foreign journalists or legal circumstances .
in 2003 , the Province officially covered in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as well located as it is desert . the trip contains a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Ar@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by b@@ am@@ bo@@ o f@@ ences , and made of corrugated walls , which were transformed by rust in different gel@@ b@@ brown tones .
only very few Indonesia have made her trip here , sof@@ ten as journalists and practically no fore@@ igner .

Pap@@ ua is the worst province where 28 % of people living below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ lands in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort generated $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has a wooden resources valued at an estimated $ 78 billion dollars .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that ensuring that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens continued to keep an initial presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 totalled nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ a recei@@ v@@ ables due to larger autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and be mer@@ cil@@ able .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military , tor@@ tured and imprisoned .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as St@@ es@@ har@@ land in the 1970 @-@ ies have been committed to the genocide of the Asia human rights of genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to all things , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are contained in a report by the arch@@ ers of Brisbane from the year 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities and torture - rape and rape are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal rainfall in peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims which happen every week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bolts are ampli@@ fied since Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of settlements from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian but the dem@@ ographic development changes , as Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .

the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and infr@@ ing@@ ement of the rights violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann reaches 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential Palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and today the loc@@ als feel betrayed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have approved for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will satisfy our hopes that justice will be re@@ produced , &quot; says You .
Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep spot for two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is opening in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers removed in a motorbike through the darkness .
the fri@@ gh@@ tened children said to them that they should switch to their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and later returned to four soldiers , the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their bra@@ i@@ ets , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers put into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things es@@ cal@@ ated on the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to claim justice .
they carried out em@@ on@@ ial Jag@@ t@@ ö@@ gen and caused the Wa@@ ita Dance - circul@@ ating in circle and a bird life - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag in to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , a command was sent over an internal wireless : &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which has not been released in local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ four@@ t@@ els of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the above risk and called to rest , and called for the people to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly moved to my left hand , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful wooden house .
k@@ ay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crow@@ ded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , a witness to the witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran@@ ned to him , and sought out his body to be sure that he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who carries a name only one name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I was kissed him . &quot;
the che@@ ering spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers would only want to back up their station , because they wanted to attack them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ br@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the messages about the red@@ ness came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed a passionate speech at which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ ware to tackle the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; I want that this case is immediately resolved so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said .
safety minister Wir@@ anto told in October 2016 that he held an extra@@ judicial mechanism to establish historic human rights violations .
but they began to talk about immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred prior to long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we are obliged to tackle this violation , but there are processes that have to run through , &quot; he said .
then , Wir@@ anto opened an withdrawal when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 and said , He has no plans to establish a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
instead &quot; everything is regulated , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto who demanded the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua has already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai .
the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims killed such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in anxi@@ ety years later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; I fear , being arrested by the military , have fear , shot and shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead bodies , the army sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the g@@ eries have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police hit the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais &apos;s neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a con@@ front@@ ation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a @-@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was d@@ row@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died in the hospital .
protest@@ ing vill@@ agers protest@@ ers in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers then threw stones on officers who responded by using warning notes .
but some loc@@ als say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian par@@ amil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we have fear that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives in the vicinity of the hospital , and as the last one has been added quickly , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
in addition , the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament called the involved officers to take account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sen@@ su@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of tri@@ vi@@ es Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al living in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many of the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ cl@@ utch army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by moving spor@@ adic attacks and demonstrations by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Y@@ og@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ oya .
in response to the past few years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sover@@ eig@@ n@@ ty . &quot;
some sc@@ uba will never go back .
Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place among people in Pap@@ ua .
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for home .
bread is just out of range .
people build here everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture remains the task of the women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
you keep the bulk of harvest@@ ers for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a co@@ sting only 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 cents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new immig@@ rants has grown to have arrived since the opening of new air routes to the Nab@@ il airport in larger numbers .
the few jobs that are in the region will typically go to the better educ@@ ated and we@@ al@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua have rare the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own company competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , who is Chair@@ woman of Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s headquarters .
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition restrictions of coverage international media are cl@@ amped .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given for films .
according to Ph@@ el@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , have been able to support restrictions of coverage to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new d@@ angers for foreign journalists who try to report of In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens un@@ pleasant provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; said he in a statement .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government will largely be restricted to the immediate neighbours par@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pairs of Pacific states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine Islands and the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have also seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir specified the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalist in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia it is still a dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ cally safe system , and there are free media , so that it is difficult to do the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments should acknow@@ ledge that .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura continued their silence and severely troubled him . &quot; we want freedom &quot; in accordance with a source that also participated in the session , but wants to remain anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia had another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that it will probably not be true for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council &apos;s headquarters .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is living under the constant threat of violence and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , has to consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; that he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want just justice , &quot; says he .
despite the thre@@ ats and en@@ roll@@ ments , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai bonds bear a last symbolic act of p@@ ite : the car@@ c@@ che of an sacrifice was buried on a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they may not know that perhaps we will never come to righteousness , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire collect the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; Wol@@ k@@ eh@@ zer from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , reaching hundreds of inhabitants , out of the 337 m high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that starts in just two years through the sky@@ scrap@@ er , which is called accid@@ ental in the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were no reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we have stood at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
we went down the stairs and lasted approximately 10 minutes to come from the 50th floor down , &quot; a residents that had called George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection agencies said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 pm local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the buildings burned .
the government said they work on the provision of accomod@@ ations for the person concerned .
the incident may cause questions to safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage from the facing , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain said the police , they believe that the system of panels to insulation and clothing at the London Gren@@ ada Tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire might have died , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Court ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at its meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , it was supported for this sport revolutionary suggest@@ ion , Davis @-@ Cup single only yet to play two winning sets , W@@ afer @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the often very long , but even so very estimated five @-@ set classic will remain in the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ g@@ ty only scar@@ cely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership has not received the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these ic@@ onic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty .
you will continue to work to improve the application .
at all , not only for the vote , after many years before the proposal , the finale came to a neutral spot .
new from 2018 will only be compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be host the host in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organis@@ ers , the requirements in terms of training places are facilit@@ ated and the players must be completed in less official media appoint@@ ments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings right items into the plane , find a survey
a survey conducted by flight pass@@ words showed that more than 20 percent are deliber@@ ate or deliber@@ ately associated objects at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which em@@ bles the aircraft , while they were able to carry out knife or other items associated with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they were dis@@ cer@@ ely discovered that they have travelled ir@@ rati@@ cally with fire@@ arms , amm@@ o or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey conducted at more than 1,000 persons - which was conducted by a Jet Charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also confirmed that younger trav@@ ellers rather re@@ prove the rules .
of those surveyed said that they have been attemp@@ ting to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that have been deliber@@ ated to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated to have indic@@ ative objects with clin@@ ches through security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male question@@ ed have also confirmed that they had been inten@@ tionally banned drugs in the airplane .
the company said it inter@@ viewed passengers throughout the country to find out how many accid@@ entally would have brought ill@@ nesses through the airport security and how many things have been deliber@@ ately done .
it is no surprise that people who have d@@ row@@ ned or ignor@@ ant - by security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA directives are slightly complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally safe that fluids have to take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the biggest amount of the objects used by the T@@ SA were used .
for a long time , the people thought the T@@ SA could view books as a reproach .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : ten thousands of Tesla to cancel Order
El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
at this time , he has so far beaten that a part of the customer has withdrawn its commitment to the customer .
in addition to the always tri@@ p@@ umping numbers , Tesla &apos;s boss El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the announcement of recent quarterly review , has betrayed another , less smoo@@ ther number : for the cancellations made at the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
Mus@@ k had frequently asked more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders to the new car over the past months , whose delivery is already underway .
now Mus@@ k was spatial : the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations have been withdrawn from 63@@ .000 .
critics only had pointed out that it merely is a non @-@ binding reservations .
at a cancellation , Tesla is charged the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 USD ) in the US and the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) .
currently 45@@ 5,000 of these non @-@ eng@@ age reservations made noti@@ fi@@ able Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
however , the cancellation of up to now approximately twelve percent of all orders could be problem , the Tesla chef doesn &apos;t believe .
its argument : the challenge for an ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
last year Tesla generated 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is supposed to be launched - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who order today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; must be delivered in the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tesla makes it possible to drive his brand new , never in practice tested production lines without greater interrup@@ tions .
many experts doub@@ ts that this is possible .
but it comes to bigger delay , then the binding sensitivity of reservations should be fixed to a problem for Tesla .
for then , the company can &apos;t be satisfied with satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt is re@@ trac@@ ted for execution of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , decre@@ ed its previous decision to delay the rules of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g substances .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the shift when his agency proved to be the needs of state @-@ related environmental authorities in relation to re@@ ac@@ tly faster than previous years .
he also mentioned the law@@ suit that had been issued against his prior spot in a Federal Court of Appeal .
it is a deadline that went off on October 1 for states to keep the 2015 level of ozone @-@ level ozone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would provide the observ@@ ance of a year , to study his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in local decisions of unique or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump State attor@@ ney of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponents of str@@ en@@ ous environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt is repeated to block regul@@ ating , or delayed , to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have resi@@ sted .
the sudden change of the Wednesday is the youngest legal return for the P@@ ru@@ ten regular Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appeal decided that the EPA fin@@ ing authority has exceeded its authority , as he attempted to delay the implementation of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reducing me@@ than@@ es , to delay .
in a report published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt car@@ ded that his return tide of ozone standards can simply intensi@@ fy the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the countries through the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former administration , the EPA frequently asked the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then maintained by activists , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation through jurisdiction , and we &apos;ll take time .
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA announced that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually made his &quot; refuge for delay and all other tradem@@ arks acknowledged to make sure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress in Congress is focusing on a comprehensive new version of the ozone rules .
a legislative design will be delayed by at least eight years in the last month of approval .
the measure was not implemented in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who had pro@@ claim the EPA in this week , said the Group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of the EPA - according to our sounds - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New York and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York placed in this case in California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penns@@ ville , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refined , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the standing smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems with sensitive respir@@ atory problems , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on sp@@ urs out sur@@ round the course of the course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is trou@@ bl@@ esome , how much pressure it needs to be bre@@ athe in order for the protection of the air that we in@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight against the ide@@ ological battle of the Tr@@ ump Government to fight against environmental contamination and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it &apos;s a unique cre@@ dible sm@@ all@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Chapel was mentioned for the first time in the Württemberg &apos;s reference book : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the all @-@ known parish church , Eber@@ hard from Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , standing on the Tum@@ linger Berg in addition to the former parish church there was a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church or patron , and not vice vers@@ a .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ eral Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third one of the ancient settlements of the village .
old cards from the time around the year 1600 are the historic monuments .
the cartridge law came out of the early medieval building of residence .
one Lord , who built a church , and occupied himself with a priest , remained loy@@ alist of this church , and could also be inher@@ ited this owner .
this was linked to the priest &apos;s priest or to propose a new priest &apos;s priest .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater detail of the two pieces on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was then bought in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the windows were covered and the bell was stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops arrived near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as a fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 1809 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead of Hör@@ schwe@@ iler .
in 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us church was demolished .
only the church tower was left .
during the new year of the year 1834 , a storm that tower collap@@ sed and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished .
only the tower @-@ existing tower remained true today as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Det@@ em of the &quot; Schaff@@ ner retired &quot; as his successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility .
as organizer invite friends and conveyor tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16th , to sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .

association wants to verify approval of Win@@ dr@@ yers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not have a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and is therefore adapted to the land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has been promp@@ ted by the Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to re@@ vo@@ ke his appro@@ vals for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette .
it was un@@ lawful .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could be approved , as at the time in quarter only there exists a wind force concentration camp near Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this centr@@ ation zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are possible , at the same time , the centr@@ ation zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many zones are to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had approved a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette as a few days ago - but the Düsseldorf District government has not approved , because of a form@@ ulate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of regulatory authority , the approval of approval according to as illegal and is thus decre@@ asing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council again decided in front of the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette . a approval by the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the request of approval for the construction of wind turbines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan@@ etary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the re@@ jection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has received a speaker since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle will take it to the occasion to check the matter again .
but they are not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
with a look at the ongoing proceedings in the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to be in@@ ject to the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; in Germany . &quot;
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ eimer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind turbines .
the company had already been involved in the city of four @-@ homes in the past year , le@@ ases with the owner of about 65 hectares of land .
the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered with construction of the four wind turbines - this represents around one @-@ fifth of the power requirement of all four households .
NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , four con@@ sens@@ us city council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .

city and dealers plan &quot; hom@@ eland @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
Bad Langen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and municipal administration will use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to attract the inhabitants of shopping expedition to the city centre .
as the chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will show the customer for it , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ products .
planned is a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre to &quot; mit@@ ter@@ med @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; should be loaded .
by doing this , the action is not only on inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
in preparation , advertising spots will be on the radio , a Internet video and printed bag that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
municipal administration and industrial Association co@@ operate with the Chamber of commerce and industry .
this enables to go to the commercial club and the city into another stage of the project &quot; attractive city centre . &quot;
there are also new offers like the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; for well @-@ selling Sunday , discussions with all commercial tra@@ ders and hosts to move it for active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the zi@@ cht on parking fees in this day are part of the concept .
customer claims to be re @-@ opened or re@@ signed again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many loc@@ als have lost the city centre when they come from a glance .
at the end , all of them will help to revi@@ ve the city center - to rent the city , placing the whole city and clubs .
it sailed to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had been spread wider in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , Head of the I@@ HK Centers in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , decided to take part in the nationwide &quot; hom@@ eland @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time five of the Thuring@@ ian cities .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ sa this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ m@@ mer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should recru@@ it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreci@@ ation of the local trade and its significance for the collective of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Yahweh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the lead of the I@@ HK and with many partners continue to make clear that every citizen could also be able to alter his concern itself with its buyer &apos;s behavior .

Tr@@ ump put in for@@ ged tran@@ scripts from telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on the 27th of January Tr@@ ump entered in a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly , that he would not pay for a scheduled border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President ruled it because he had publicly att@@ ested the wall publicly . according to report , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware to leave Mexico for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m g@@ utter were also published and un@@ dis@@ closed issues .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said to assume a trade for the US refugees trying to take over &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , who by the government Obama would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turn@@ Pro , &quot; that is the most famous call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ mass@@ acres : activists take rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury went through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ed to the Ford bridge from Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the Mo@@ bs - a man @-@ middle age in a dot strike - took a long train at his cig@@ ar , looking at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cried out for the silence , when a young black man was cr@@ ushed out of the passenger seat .
fortunately , this aw@@ ful scene was played , which was played on 22 July , only a follow @-@ up .
but when a pl@@ uck is thrown over the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them in the audience hit very genuine sig@@ h .
since 2005 , Citi@@ zenship joined the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Doro@@ thy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - started from the K@@ u Kl@@ ux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ imagin@@ able that in all these years no only person was arrested , although we know them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Brook@@ s that helps in the organization of re@@ location .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history but it is a burden of our souls . &quot;
Brook@@ s is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old member of the State of Georgia and a civil society .
for him , the estate is used as a dramatic call for action and represents a yearly reminder of the Monroe community that never has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to prosecution , we want the termination , we want to be healed , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can not get to healing and reconciliation , until we obtain justice . &quot;
a mur@@ derer on the Lei@@ che of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ am on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files that were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none was ever indicted .
although the susp@@ ects left for decades on free foot , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court ruled the black citizens in Georgia to vote their voice in the summer for the first time .
in about the same time , as the election st@@ resses according to the FB@@ I of the Black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ col@@ m , a white basic owner , Bar@@ cute H@@ ester , settled in a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .
Brook@@ s said that it was rum@@ oured in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Doro@@ thy and that the baby had her , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Doro@@ thy and her cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
but when it was removed from the prison , Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge saw the car surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consists of a FB@@ I Report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosec@@ utor , which was not only involved in the mor@@ als , pro@@ ofs the evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brook@@ s formulated it even more excellent .
&quot; it was a election campaign , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost one decade , Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene led the annual follow @-@ up of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their picture is descrip@@ tive , aw@@ ning and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , that many believed that he does not exist in America .
it is difficult to look , and even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we have con@@ fron@@ ted with its he@@ aders in all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - in a space and listen , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played survey of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ t@@ co @-@ director .
he played the role of the boss cluster member since years but he said that the role does never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story by life because we would not want to return to that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , play Roger Mal@@ col@@ m and Bar@@ cute H@@ ester .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester an@@ cri@@ es and pressed him , watching that he slept with his wife Doro@@ thy .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , w@@ ander out of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona Again the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laugh@@ ter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the end .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; she asked shaving .
he is al@@ armed and conf@@ used .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still d@@ yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that white people then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; swe@@ at is one of the other black per@@ formers .
&quot; you just need to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and just as it moves the energy in the room , a feeling of the camera &apos;s bow was replaced .
everyone is busy that this is correct but not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no laugh@@ s .
this repet@@ ition is non@@ violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a wedding dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads Billi@@ on holidays of mour@@ ning &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; .
their voice breaks out for every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers were swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is split almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many of coming down the street .
they all have seen all almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as inhibit@@ ing humidity , if Brook@@ s she runs on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ se have stayed a ne@@ c@@ n@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels pen@@ stically .
when the final score of the songs invites Gre@@ ene the amount to come closer and inspec@@ ting the dead bodies .
children till their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per to one another .
&quot; they are not dead , &quot; mur@@ der@@ ings a little boy , when he would like to remember it .
after a couple of minutes the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take away the Lyn@@ x arrow and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit which the cl@@ an@@ an has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona ab@@ h@@ ates two of his fellow players and breaks down in their arms , while the emotional last of the performance breaks down with him .
&quot; it is okay . &quot; whis@@ per one of the women .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience turns up with the actors for dinner together .
at one table , a white pair of Atlanta stim@@ ulated about the follow @-@ up of a black pair , which they had just learned .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people coming like yourself and those that do , because they look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really is doing with me can believe that the Lyn@@ n is still going on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Brook@@ s Hof stops his table , he e@@ ats and commemor@@ ates the rights of civil rights .
he said he began planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; the position is inspir@@ ing in a certain way , because it describes the terror of what we have done , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it &apos;s so , if we learn nothing out of it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , he who doesn &apos;t know his own history is do@@ omed to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ äm@@ merung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental plant , director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a bun@@ e @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e Ins@@ ulation in front of gigantic , six @-@ story scenes .
the turn@@ b@@ ühne ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) is an optional street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York stock exchange .
prior to this , an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , used as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or an alternative , or an alternative to Is@@ etta .
the st@@ acked oil waters remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mot@@ iv - money , power and gre@@ ed - that draws up through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhine Valley - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; .
k@@ ess brought her Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , a cas@@ cade in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give a cas@@ ks in the boot space and give the Kra@@ wal@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing s@@ ings the great fi@@ del@@ ity Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight @-@ box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he be@@ es Siegfried .
later it has to believe in Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) .
the audience represents the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my , F@@ ost@@ er , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who has formed hum@@ ble and bowed his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there are big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the great heat back in Leg@@ erer leisure clothing .
the gig was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team &apos;s team at the time of tension .
in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to leave the flute concert over himself , five years later , there were big Ju@@ bel in which the promised &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; ru@@ fe went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have pleased about this .
&quot; it shows that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said to be the performance of d@@ pa shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its visibility .
I go a positive res@@ ume .
max quantity is working as a volunte@@ er
they work in her volunte@@ er year at several locations .
where to everywhere ?
amount : usually in Schwein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open day at school .
how are your experiences thus ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with adolescents , with refugees , with young adults .

how does it come ?
quantity : I did my secondary school .
and then a Civil Engineering , let &apos;s say , successful .
I recognized for myself that it is for me the wrong and I want to make something different with people work .
and then I asked me what do you do .
make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , since you can see how it is on @-@ site , in the focal point maybe even , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in the youth agency Her@@ ne is a social worker training and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not un@@ common to have several different locations throughout the volunte@@ er ?

quantity : I am not the guy .
there is a range that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there is also negative moments , but this is that life .

EPA returns to the delay of Smo@@ g @-@ Rule to Kl@@ agen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation by the government of Obama , repe@@ ating that the states are obliged to ins@@ ane the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency .
the EPA announced late at wed@@ n@@ esday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Regulations 2015 &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to co@@ operate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt was announced in June the intention of the EPA , the ozone regulations - in which some of the country pollutants are to be measured in order to establish where cuts are to be delayed - to delayed a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , was filed on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tries to raise a wide range of environmental guidelines , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed on economic growth as part of a wider agenda that will spur growth in its economic growth .
the efforts , however , triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and reserves , to worry about the impact of greater emissions to public health .
the EP@@ O &apos;s website says that the in@@ hale of air that contains ozone &quot; reduces the lung function and strengthen the respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; as for example as@@ thma .
community plans Meeting
at the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ point , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ners appro@@ ves the establishment of a joint room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still lack of land was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although , until now , until the church community , there is an area of community property until now , there is no plans for a private investor to support a private investor .
there is a discussion about a joint space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters and a adjacent terrace with a total price of 70 square meters .
the administration and the majority of the council , such a common space is not considered to be meeting point for the residents of the righteous place , but open to the municipality .
for example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the round .
the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has been decided in the last autumn by means of funding .
construction is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a joint area would be reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 per cent of 30 percent eligible .
the decision for the investor wants to sign@@ alize that in this respect , there is no bil@@ let between the legs , the conclusion that both the surrounding area should be le@@ aned - as well as a cult roof - which makes the Tr@@ ace height and the construction of economical - is possible .
un@@ necessary , so don &apos;t just remember Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanimously he happens the body .
it is not as simple as the common room .
Daniela Call to the many of their own buildings , with whom you are not so well advanced , therefore you rest now at the common room from the window , says she : &quot; I do so difficult to say . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ iger is definitely talking to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it , a covered payout of cash , or even Foreign Invest@@ ors .
that is not even so , because with the acquisition of an area one does not give an allowance , but also get a real , in a doubt market value , the counter@@ f@@ ails .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application , adopted decision to be taken accordingly , will find three advoc@@ ate .
so , with two counter@@ vote in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller is thus summar@@ ised : &quot; when we summar@@ ise the resolution , we make a huge step , a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

hiking in the resin of star to Stern
the first &quot; star@@ ters &quot; nationwide is to be created in the Harz mountains .
the club Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this plant .
there is a plan@@ etary defence in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ dom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming towards the information needs of many har@@ z@@ ers who was called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement , and sporty performance .
the members want to set along the planned route panels and inform them about stars and star@@ ters .
during the first phase till 2018 the association is planning &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
in@@ quiries Far@@ ms St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ eiß Ri@@ vers , and Sie@@ ber .
information on the tablets are to be completed by the internet .
therefore there is a role in the location selection of a good mobile network reception .
also Acc@@ essi@@ bility is a crit@@ erion .
later the star path was to be extended by train .
&quot; on the stell@@ ar path , the viewer experience a much worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; said the club .
in addition , they learned why stars were different colors or why a star is stronger than any other , although it is considerably removed .
also , in which constellation will find a rather selected star and when he is best to see .
the club has been operating the highest located star in northern Germany since 2014 in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Government in the middle of the Harz National Park , the Federal Office for Nature Conservation is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible from the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt has existed since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium in Göttingen , something similar to the planned star of the planet .
beginning prior to prayer hotel in the Goethe alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the plan@@ etary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Municipality of Gl@@ eichen ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the pitch with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf planet Pl@@ u@@ to at the end point - are exactly in the distance and scale from one to two billion .
the earth sh@@ run@@ k like a ball of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the sun measures exactly 75 meters away , the sun measures 70 centimeters .
the entire distance to the planet is good four kilometers .
while the light from sun up to the plot is about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to kno@@ ck with Pl@@ u@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than light in the world .
the march to the next fixed star would take another half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o meet for the first time , discuss@@ ing a possible show down

&quot; I am a former co@@ incidence , &quot; remin@@ ded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I went up to Br@@ oner &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on light weight .
and he must move on track weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then fight .
they are the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enk@@ o felt right .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked after him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and op@@ pressed later to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .

Fort@@ un@@ cture Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hop@@ ing for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er against Braunschweig , making the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
in the first race of the year Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , would not have been the two opponents to the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the triple chain is to be further optimized .
and one gate after a Free Kick will also don &apos;t want to capture even more .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better in preparation with the bearing chain better than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know as we are in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his cause certainly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just mounted on the half chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Cast@@ ing el@@ mann players who can build up well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condition is , but that we are even more harmon@@ ize , so that we could not aff@@ ord a lot of ab@@ dic@@ ate errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann is also driving to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you can &apos;t talk about a mis@@ guided tour , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the achievement could definitely be okay . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are able to focus on Sunday with four points and we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about that his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; the start into the season Be@@ am I only did after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off because of an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season like a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the player from Au@@ e may perhaps be somewhat fresh , since they have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a asc@@ ension into the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 % where they are currently standing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the De@@ fen@@ ders of Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests are coming from the Rhineland become light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us go away , only because we are the right to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must hit from the out@@ set , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ ami .
&quot; such a statement would be ar@@ ro@@ gant and adul@@ ter@@ ous . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish As@@ ylum System Review Publ@@ ished
the youngest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( hard drives ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
they are to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish immig@@ ration authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ et ) critic@@ ised some refugees who were involved in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees .
up to date , mig@@ rat@@ e@@ et has sent 6.@@ 880 to test@@ i@@ ent cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31st July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ordered that the person &quot; could be &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no great difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years means not necessarily means that the asylum seek@@ ers has bent over his age .
in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it would give 4@@ 42 cases , the &quot; propose that the patient had to be 18 years or older . &quot;
when the sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bl@@ a@@ det published the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases it had said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age condem@@ nation , in the cor@@ onation of wisdom teach@@ ings and MRI images of con@@ ical joints , which then are analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a sc@@ ep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institut , which includes the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans in order to see if they were earlier or later as usually by the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age to assess this way is very un@@ certain .
if we cannot say it , we should not do so as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , def@@ ended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of an adult is inf@@ erior to an adult .
the greatest risk of this is , if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
work on the three bridges of highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come out well .
on Wednesday a seven ton heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ manager at the Department of Road Transport and Transport in the Mayor of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work started to work on all three renovated needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule will be adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete that is clothed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the centre of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge folder .
this is a bound@@ ary , which is also used as operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2.@@ 20 metres should be inserted .
then the pedestrian path should be gone .
the particular thing is that it is a patent for finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented ball arms .
the special finger feel has the laying of leads through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre optic cable which has been connected to many companies .
the institutions were informed about the project in preparation of the project .
and at first we had to cut fish and canc@@ ers .
for the bridges between the building farm and the collective , towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is governed by a traffic light .
for the construction of the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; are closed .
the cost of the three fires amounts to 700 000 Euro .
it is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest at German potato salad
it &apos;s not so frequently asked that parties go on a string , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( depreciation ) , comes along what else is hard to bring to a hat .
the parties representing in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcan@@ ic stone parties ( CDU , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Lin@@ ke ) belong to a wide Alliance , that indicates that day peac@@ efully flag , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to a poster emphas@@ ized by a poster .
and well @-@ known name on the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , will become the top duo for the Bundestag &apos;s election on September 24 , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
but those who are already before the event before the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ anas , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now there is now on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and therefore just before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that gives itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum A world and one of the principal organizers , really happy : &quot; great , how many people are come together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; German potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ anas , &quot; says the woman who brought him .
the police occupied many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , and shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel reported that he compl@@ ain about such an event and get a supplement .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ ers@@ dorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us , not enough parking is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ an area he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ ra@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair Uwe Young .
in the au@@ ditorium there are approximately 200 people who are waiting to keep the top @-@ leading candidates for the Bundestag &apos;s election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
however the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials were a quiet night .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , guests on the fore@@ ground have a longer breath , but there is also shortly after 21 o &apos;clock in the event .
the police for@@ g@@ aps - no special incid@@ ents .

&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love to love , whom I am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or believe you about , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten told that they were bis@@ exual : &quot; I have lived on du@@ alism and had been very seriously .
so it has never conf@@ used or hin@@ dered me .
I liked it just never to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them they suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang show bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time they prefer to dress like a b@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that has really hurt me .
when I was 11 , the children said to me , I would look like a book .
I really felt that fri@@ gh@@ tened and damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to love her love : &quot; people expect to be relatively low in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some could mark me some und@@ ou@@ tri@@ bar , but I don &apos;t like to just@@ ify myself in front of the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with president of Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have turned from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and many refle@@ ctions ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ onal governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; said Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice also not endor@@ sed the Democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which according to Forbes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes stipul@@ ates that he has stu@@ ff@@ ed cab@@ ines in five states , and inher@@ ited carbon life from his father .
he is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening announced a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party change of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather be able to make us better than to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vy and the control of the least laws in history , the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice , only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from top to bottom , and not able to find a positive , successful embassy , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair@@ s R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement of the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E commen@@ ds &quot; hon@@ our@@ able &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al
the global leader of the athlet@@ ics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ s on Thursday what he described as an open exc@@ use from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ al , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country again to be included in the sports .
Russia &apos;s athlet@@ ics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the eve of the World Athlet@@ ics World Championships that the ban of his country was correct out of the sport and that he was determined to combat the d@@ oping .
he told him for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off at competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban that was adopted in November 2015 after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) advis@@ es to state @-@ sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very hon@@ our@@ able presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress were happy that Russian Federation has experienced themselves to itself , that they will have some pretty hot times and everything will do so to ensure that the Federation will be redesigned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E said that Russia is also &quot; pleased that Russia accept@@ ing the criteria for his re@@ launch .
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ ti@@ ci@@ ous day , and I think it was progress , but the congress supported the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; we must do everything in the next months to norm@@ alize this situation .
the principle of principle was always to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start in the Athlet@@ ics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London after the strict IA@@ AF criteria .
the leaders of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for re@@ setting .
drug tests are still indisp@@ ens@@ able and forbidden trainer are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture given at the IA@@ AF Council .

doub@@ ts at the UN mission in Mali was not shown by the Ley@@ sin : the mission is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he was also of great importance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , of which we are separated from two states &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife after his death .
this gave the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish kingdom in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de is buried .
the sculptor Bj@@ ø@@ r@@ n N@@ ø@@ r@@ ga@@ ard made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen may agree with the decision of her husband , and it was written in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik may be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he didn &apos;t int@@ end to be buried in his French home country .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a command that he was not happy with his title .
he would like to be king in 1972 following the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
he retired from retirement in 2016 and also puts the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ ahl &quot; title .
since Hen@@ rik won &apos;t receive the title and the function which he wanted to see himself compared to his wife , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife , declared L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chef @-@ speaking of the Danish kingdom house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be finally un@@ clear .
but he has not kept the intention of being buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble line@@ age , had learned in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his future wife , Prince Hen@@ rik , in his almost 50 @-@ year old rule , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious state of his 50 @-@ year rule .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did .
my Danish was we@@ al@@ able , I preferred the wine instead of beer , silk t@@ aps instead of kn@@ it so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l , which I smo@@ ked in instead of Virginia tobacco and to be able to be a reputation to be the brand &apos;s owner of critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope in view .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
they were just two mist@@ akes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants r@@ ash re @-@ selection
CDU and F@@ DP in front of the possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ know@@ ingly Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) resi@@ des after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ selection of the country &apos;s day , but he does not want to withdraw .
because he spoke out on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprise withdrawal of a Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s from their Parliament re@@ fraction in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their close one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ed its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
CDU faction leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ick@@ ler would recommend to join the Group to record them .
thus , CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the reverse was vice vers@@ a .
the new Parliament will be elected on 14th January next year .
Th@@ et@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could rule no majority in this situation .
however , Stephan Weil , however , holds that the country &apos;s day rapidly resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further procedure .
the Constitution can also see the possibility of withdraw@@ als from the Prime Ministers by the Prime Minister &apos;s trust and a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legal properly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ reads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is rest in peace with all questions , when they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ um@@ ler named T@@ western &apos;s Step &quot; but a little bit cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politicians have stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not eng@@ age . &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she describes herself as a successor of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ hor@@ n@@ ly de@@ pu@@ ties to the return of their country &apos;s government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are of course , of course , that she has received its Land@@ tag@@ onal trade , which she returns to the green national list , with immediate effect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the presi@@ ding Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parliamentary president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regre@@ t the decision of El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
they deliber@@ ately decided to lead no warning in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the background that there were no content differences , we can &apos;t follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Social Democratic candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survi@@ vor@@ s of the Lower Saxony @-@ Represent@@ atives El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU as betra@@ y@@ al .
&quot; the behavior of the former Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ y@@ al to the elec@@ tors and elec@@ tors , but also betra@@ y@@ on Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the B@@ und@@ esch@@ ef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .
he under@@ support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , who can quickly select the country &apos;s day .
the outlet for T@@ western ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
in her last erup@@ tion and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests was the good of the country , &quot; critic@@ ized SPD @-@ Secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ and@@ al that sets the CDU in Lower Saxony of this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ play and tries to beat the political capital . &quot;
Nieder@@ know@@ ingly CDU faction leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ udi@@ ler wants to take his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU .
the Group Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ets , with a personal career give the outcome of the Parliament election in 2013 .
the CDU was the strongest power at that time in the SPD and the SPD in the Parliament , however , had a small majority vote in a vote .
the Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect against us from tox@@ ins , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses on poll@@ uted eggs .
how did the sc@@ and@@ al happen ?
how can the consumer protect themselves .
Federal Minister for Agriculture ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against po@@ is@@ ins ?
I can only encourage all consumer ances and consumer , to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
the Länder conver@@ ged the latest information on the affected eggs on the site of www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de for the federal states .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even though , according to all that we know , a health companion is impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of re@@ conn@@ aissance not truly perceived by the German Federal Minister ?
the food monitoring is the role of the states .
nevertheless , my House is immediately connected immediately and has since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s data in tight inter@@ change with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same as the manufacturer to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health harm@@ less .
if with eggs the rear @-@ level of 0.000@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies school .
are production companies and consumers in the same boot ?
according to such a label , there is no immediate gu@@ ilt in the production facilities .
rather , they must reck@@ on with severe illegal practices by services companies with economic damage .
as always there are few t@@ att@@ ing in the harvest .
is it missing only on the staff or also to the slim jurisdiction ?
it &apos;s just the official controls that we have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is , however , that food products and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 per cent .
this is why a consistent ess@@ ay of such events and hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor in the cases , in which criminal off@@ ences can be pre@@ defined , of decisive importance .
I have already done several times that I expect a we@@ ather@@ less explanation of the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm extre@@ mis@@ m in food scales really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and market@@ able food .
if a non @-@ registered insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are right .
by the pan@@ ic means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
generally , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de Fi@@ pron@@ il in the post@@ ure living animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately .
it must always be rig@@ or@@ ously printed on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect of all the competent authorities that the atomic fact will be rapidly dissolved .
how to negoti@@ ate the finance rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that insi@@ sted on preventing the issues of the European football , N@@ ey@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not inter@@ f@@ ere .
any consequences will be coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , because the leading organisation , which monitored the European game , has power , teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules , which was launched by the UEFA in 2011 means that PS@@ G must im@@ itate sometime , that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to make the Brazilian one out of his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which is valued at several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make security loose with security , thus ne@@ ym@@ ar signs and bring it into a galax@@ y of other Stars , because of the financing of the teams through the energy @-@ rich Gl@@ asses family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend much money for the acquisition of players , but must be with legitim@@ ate obj@@ ections , which enable them to allow the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini as a UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that someone who had enormous debt in their asp@@ ir@@ ation to success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to recru@@ it themselves , when banks or owners had returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P increased from the concentration to the losses of their losses on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , Roman demol@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally bought in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested in order to improve the team and to build a global brand - to a har@@ der matter .
while the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros .
and though Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ z@@ in continues to leave out of over@@ looked spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules of the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , against The Associated Press in the past week .
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount of invoice about the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption price for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G , together with Abu Dhabi , is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G has a fine of 60 million euro ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to € 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 will be restricted to 21 players .
the UEFA Cup is looking for clubs that could try to render their financial view , by selling her revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company is sponsor PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not leave it as a legitim@@ ate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of the PSA by the Qatar Tourism Authority was made .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar about payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 question@@ ed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be Ambassador and could be simply discover such a der@@ ive maneu@@ ver for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA can still be atten@@ tive to note any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no pre @-@ preparation convers@@ ations with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associated Press , since it was not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the recent reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year will still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive upon arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ Deals , merch@@ an@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ c@@ ot@@ ting purchases .
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 per cent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly ir@@ m@@ ashed , one of the best football players go to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ s , claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear fall of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ar &apos;s last owner on PS@@ G .
ar@@ senal Manager Ar@@ s@@ ene W@@ enger , whose association is owned by American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , spl@@ its the reservations of La League against a state to finance an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it &apos;s very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or other interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

as many applic@@ ants will be able to tender in the new press , the Swiss will not be betrayed .
but in question , only Swiss manufacturers are coming .

blow to drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning were held in the Black Forest , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konst@@ anz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , and searched out numerous objects as the Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Konst@@ anz on Friday .
thereby 15 were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years ago and arrest warran@@ ts issued in arrest warran@@ ts .
in addition , the officials issued major amounts of mar@@ i@@ juana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same raid , two persons were arrested .
a German arrest warran@@ ts issued against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore expected to be shipped to Germany .
the action was Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
over 300 polic@@ emen have been in use .
the members of the m@@ af@@ ia organized drug criminal off@@ ences , severe violent crimes , temp@@ ter murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and bur@@ ial .
since the summer of 2016 , the Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Konst@@ anz has been determined against the organised drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in the South German room .
between senior executive ships in Constance and Palermo existed an exchange and investig@@ ator of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the large insert on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the vis@@ or of investigations , especially Italian nationals combined with a reference to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
on May 27 , in the morning , several shots were fired at a restaurant , in which early in the morning , several shots were fired at a restaurant .
fashion compl@@ ain great g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens who do not arise &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ igner register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany .
the lead to partly engraved with regard to asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management in the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has taken attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country &apos;s country register .
defic@@ ien@@ cies in an analysis published in the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; might result in an analysis on asylum procedures and lay@@ outs . &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people are attributable to foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million of non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because data is not suffici@@ ently cared for , the data quality has not been well maintained in parts .
in individual cases , data from 1921 found , &quot; by people who have long been long ago , or of citizens who have become a German citizen , and in the register no longer should appear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ correct data input can significantly slow@@ down significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to further slow@@ down the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of many @-@ out people , the EU citizens are ac@@ claimed that they would not have to travel at all .
but such false assign@@ ments led , &quot; but to a distor@@ ting debate on dealing with immig@@ ration , &quot; is therefore in the analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 years of children after Italy when they travelled from there .
this emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New Osn@@ ab@@ in@@ ers Zeitung reports . &quot;
according to paper , this means that B@@ AM@@ F will lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except for infants and small children - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , virtually no longer possible , the newspaper was under reference to the difficult situation .
after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees in the EU state to reach them first .
when a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it to the country .
the office has now write : &quot; in the meantime the recording capacity for families with minor children has been considerably increased in Italy . &quot;
Italy has submitted for the admission and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these additions for sufficient .
there were also other EU states to return to the Dublin Agreement as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children above the lack of defic@@ ien@@ cies in the Italian As@@ ylum System and a threat to the child . &quot;
second best result achieved
in total , a total of 220 liters of blood produced in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
meanwhile , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has meanwhile distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 don@@ keys .
traditionally , the Municipality in the meeting of the community has multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome , as our body is designed and we will declare the don@@ ors that their blood is available for strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one only blood don@@ ating helps several people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explan@@ atory of the Kreis@@ spar@@ ity of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Cor@@ enb@@ acher , for the c@@ anned food will cut into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time corn enb@@ acher reported by the actions taken in the Spring of Ober@@ ak@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K power supply manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently , changing to the theater company was led to higher participants only a few years ago .

Bank of England will retain the interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations about an increase .
the Bank of England war@@ ned that economic growth will remain &quot; orders &quot; when they held low interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure .
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( MP@@ C ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates on 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month , because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its four@@ teenth annual inflation report the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 on 1.6 % and war@@ ned that pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but they sign@@ posted that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cr@@ ushing the inflation of Bre@@ x@@ it , and they said that the loan costs may increase more than expected to the financial markets .
the members voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business package that was published one year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require a time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks , although it was said that they are expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate the bank said : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the MP@@ C GDP , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the re@@ united households will continue to use the consumption . &quot;
at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent necessary when the markets await .
the markets predicted its first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank forecast down@@ wards moment@@ ous growth forecasts for this and next year compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % increase in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures pay rising expectations on a interest rate and the GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to rise at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the Bank at the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by a rising inflation and a small salary increase , as the dis@@ closure of the worse was worse before they will be better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that the monetary policy cannot stop the income break in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they added that the wages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could recover significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ unds , which is to compens@@ ate a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision made a year following the decrease of interest rates on 0.25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ uri@@ des .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will be fully reaching the prices and economy .
prior to the final judgment of the Bank on the interest rates , the call was increased after a interest rate , while inflation increased to hard @-@ controlled households , while three political decision @-@ makers in July increased an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has decreased in the last month of 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank predicted that this was expected to come back in the next few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank told that its aims at a rate of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ ar Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap bodies , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive more competitive , since the len@@ ders are looking strong to shops and ending the year in positive manner .
the market looks particularly good for those who deal with the existing deal and will close the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to disp@@ ate the disp@@ uted HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September following a fight against financing the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevention . &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one preceding the intercourse recorded pre@@ position rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) which can reduce the risk of infection with high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , and is now supplied by health services over a first three year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he prepared to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court last year , after that the N@@ HS had decided to pay attention to the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
on Thursday announced it was announced by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be to the first to be established by people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to England in April 2018 .
pre@@ fabri@@ cated rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a sequence of HIV medicine that are taken before sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that the HIV transmission is significantly reduced with inf@@ ectious diseases .
Pr@@ EP prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medic@@ ations are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come into question for the treatment , schw@@ ule or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners , which were not successfully treated successfully .
in the clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a medical doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will acquire £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the medicine in this week after an international competitive proc@@ urement .
the study is to evaluate the entire potential of pr@@ EP by bringing clinical evidence , as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should increase and increasingly successful efforts to the prevention of HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress with regard to one of the largest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to needy and end@@ angered people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the possibility to change the English HIV epidem@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to become people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled and does not perform with a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many lives .
we welcome all this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be advised that the study is rapidly carried out throughout the country and nobody who has a risk for HIV .
now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test Medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Sharon Hod@@ g@@ son , Sh@@ adows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the P@@ EP process is due to monthly delay and hes@@ itation through the government to welcome and over@@ due .
the evidence show how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it is to contribute to a step closer to the termination of HIV in society .
live the big life : mezzanine and cle@@ ver Designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home .
Jo@@ anne L@@ eig@@ h , a former bank woman with a passion for real estate , reduced by a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne wasn &apos;t packed with bags and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex @-@ bridge in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something similar to my prize .
I was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first round , the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezzanine to use the total ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
this was my request , &quot; says she .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms sur@@ pris@@ ingly , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
it had to be creative thinking about resolve the announcement .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they had st@@ acked on each other , without that we had to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just to build a single platform , but rather t@@ ackl@@ ing the steel for the function above or below the correct height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement gave it possible to place two rooms in full height - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper window of the ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us watch over the gl@@ am@@ ous living area .
silver acc@@ ents , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to allow him to work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance we have mir@@ ro@@ ded units space for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a smooth space , the beauty of the living room can exclu@@ de the kitchen , if it is not used .
foldable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little effort of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proclaimed Er@@ fan of the Steel reinforced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that if you p@@ ushing the door , very easy to lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the cle@@ ver of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an enhanced layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and perform a calculation on the ground @-@ size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they made it to enlarge the floor space and use high @-@ quality materials that pro@@ cure the room by its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create a emotional link in a home &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square meter of something standard into something very amaz@@ ingly .
indeed , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to rely on this .
brothers strug@@ gled for a 500 million US dollar property empire
two brothers are four decades after her Italian family founded the d@@ ynast@@ y in a meditation on one of the biggest real estate agents Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and Develop@@ ers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business can be split .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp encounter over the separation occurs in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties in worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co family founded the company West@@ in Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the Stad@@ tz@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father , Colin - was described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third .
a judicial survey says that Colin property has a value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved himself for Paul as a pro@@ ud@@ point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Colin proposed survey we left him with the left which I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hear@@ ings of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday last Friday .
the brothers now are strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - from Colin , as Paul claims to do him .
Colin argu@@ ed , that is not true , but th@@ rows Paul before , to administ@@ er some poss@@ essions .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Colin , he says he will lay the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance write that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with monkey items , emails and reports from companies , including del@@ o@@ itte , pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of law firms .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immig@@ rants , who run dairy bars and delic@@ acy shops in the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Li@@ egen@@ schafts@@ betrieb in Colin , opened the first jewe@@ l of the family in Colin .
Colin says that he started West@@ in when he was &quot; high school in my last years when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi told me often that he would never have to land the brothers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De L@@ uta &apos;s group , Colin claimed that Mark had paid $ 10 million at the release of the company , and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the terms of its financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin made a lot back in Colin , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax media took in touch with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really cannot say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to compl@@ ain with our family names , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother &apos;s presence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not desire that Paul and I would like to be in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is still looking for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future , &quot; wrote Colin .
Tr@@ um@@ ps appointed new Chief of Staff to restri@@ ct the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
polit@@ ico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the News media - in hope to hold the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with leading employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House which he would rep@@ ented : poor information that come into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow information on paper - whether on paper or mail@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions , if he would obtain good information . &quot;
wa@@ iter &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to im@@ perfor@@ ate paths by super@@ v@@ ise his media device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps Relationship To TV reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; when the c@@ ump was denied due to un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; said the former elections team Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to polit@@ ico .
the Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the keys , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it is under control , according to six former elec@@ toral campaign leaders , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; was under control , is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaigns became something that we don &apos;t know other - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets could not contain more combust@@ ible products without their inter@@ ventions .
we will probably see something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump is not sent .
if his staff had already made him a couple of times , trouble from him , then their efforts were worth the effort .
but no one has consistently al@@ ert it that Tr@@ ump Con@@ tro@@ verses comes out .
a part of the problem exists in the fact that people in a White House is composed of controversi@@ al parties , trying to present their own agenda using Tr@@ ump Material , that may be promoting their views from the world .
polit@@ ico - deals with this story - in May about the pre@@ ference of consultants , pre@@ ference for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ government say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press parts , especially those with damaged Lec@@ ks , and that he should get out to figure out from whence they come .
this happened at the end of February when som@@ eb@@ ody issued a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ v@@ ok@@ at@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused his deputy chief staff in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a cluster at his close to Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past , and has contra@@ dic@@ ted them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to inqu@@ ire over Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same one for three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager in Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still working on influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make cell@@ ars mission very difficult .

in order to support our collection , it is very important that as many people , as possible , must notify anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by using 101 .
this is said to create a picture of the situation where the court must check out when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .
that &apos;s good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the then ambi@@ ence of the company mbH about the 13th of April 2014 included approximately 30 000 nights per year , and also proceeds through the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building , the hotel building , and as a collective accommodation , was offered in the district of refugees , emerging as a collective accommodation .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the setting of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not cont@@ ested at that time in the Commune .
however , in particular Freu@@ den@@ stadt , Julian Oss@@ wald def@@ ended the hotel location and spoke already by serious interest to the house at that time .
he was to keep right .
the Group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a volunte@@ er auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
you will be called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof have already been standing a construction container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renovation work had to be carried out .
the floors were torn out , blank@@ ets down to part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
all is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance area will be converted , new window will be installed .
everything should be very close as &quot; beautiful , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed himself .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
position can not be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but in the high @-@ scale city level , st@@ ems sh@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms spread wide will further explain any further .
both individual tourists , groups or business people should feel well in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Oss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so sh@@ erer .
the performances of the city are covering with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the investments of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to set out exactly .
just under a million euros , he counts .
the external air conditioning systems are also brought to fore@@ man , that is already clearly visible .
there is a large terrace that will be open to the public in a courtyard that will be accessible .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Representative uses Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s aff@@ air by US president Donald Tr@@ ump , he is said to have put a special Grand Jury named after a report .
on the last weeks the board have recorded work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under his calling with the issue .
the newspaper stated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller widened its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services accused the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have system@@ atically mixed himself in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were elections between tr@@ um@@ ps election team and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to be involved in the election campaign as an advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special advis@@ er Tr@@ ump personally cast into the centre and seek out whether the President may not ob@@ struc@@ ted the justice in the course of the aff@@ air .
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys , this evidence is to examine and decide whether it is to be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called indic@@ t@@ ments .
mostly they are switched on when it concerns bigger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always closed behind doors .
the board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to the hearing of E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N transmitter , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were issued to turn the En@@ counter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to a statement , was called it in the report .
Moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps became advis@@ er and in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ sel@@ ess president Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with the discussion .
legal experts comments on Thursday evening on Thursday evening in US television that the idea that Mu@@ eller should not restri@@ ct his work , and that he should be necessary to do quickly .
it was not necessary to force that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an acc@@ us@@ ation .
nevertheless , the implementation of the committee in the beginning of a new phase in investigations , and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the middle of the new revelation the president on Thursday night used an address in West Virginia to present the Russia @-@ aff@@ air as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good to feel good because they can &apos;t have anything else about which they can talk . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a position he caught nothing from the suspension of a Grand Jury .
however , these work usually also usually in secret , stressed he .
the White House advoc@@ ates all activities that accelerated the work of the special statement on &quot; fair &quot; ways .
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not be determined against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was the name of that explanation .
however Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
for this regime , the alleg@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became loud , he had to hin@@ der the justice .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the President is due to the investigation under large pressure .
according to representation of US media , the White House gathered a special tool against the special account and his employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
differently , as an independent special report of the congress as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate @-@ aff@@ air around the later rec@@ en President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller appointed a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired from the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent this step forward .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic trans@@ formers were issued on Thursday , after which the special permission could not be released so easy .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice @-@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has reg@@ ained about 7 times the Berlin@@ s from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this was the Zar@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Oce@@ an@@ ic Research on Wednesday .
the weight of over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large Kol@@ oss t@@ act now to the north and become probably two , three years until it be melted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice giant , researchers have registered in the past three decades .
a danger for people is not going out from him .
to what extent of climate change has played a role in demol@@ ition of the ice , is un@@ clear according to research .
however , there have been a series of unusual co@@ aches of iron pipes in the region around 30 years , the U.S. research centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact ground .
according to many researchers , this could be put together with global warming .
so far , the col@@ oss@@ al colony was so far from the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is s@@ wimm@@ ers on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
therefore , it is growing steadily to the sea and falls regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
in the north of this scarf , the balance of qu@@ ake and breaks were interrupted some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is divided in there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some reasons for the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present .
in addition , the ice sla@@ b stand below voltage and could be broken down if a piece of a key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ s@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the sk@@ el@@ age causes that gl@@ ac@@ iers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low dimensions , the British research project is responsible for observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres .
there it crash@@ es regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though there is no direct connection to climate change , the Eis@@ schild takes now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most broad@@ est retreat since the start of Records , &quot; he confirmed .
among scientists whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will again grow again or back in the long term and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if these researchers have not lead the break down of this gigantic ice @-@ iron , so many ice @-@ pet@@ el@@ ves of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have broken down in the past decades .
this long di@@ ces of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
in the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have war@@ med around three degrees and count towards the areas where the temperature is rapidly growing .
CDU wants pet cost during the staff
because it is still difficult to occupy more comfortable places , the CDU , coming from the employ@@ ers enter to get more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag has cut 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants are working for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have stood behind their first working day .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 applications were expected to be recorded during this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lack staff to handle the increased requirements and tasks .
currently , there are no vac@@ anci@@ es at the District of M@@ ett@@ mann as before 50 .
we are looking for example doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration .
the CDU wants to take part in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative to attack the initiative and head of the specialists in administration .
in accordance with the desire of the parties &quot; management , the management is to recru@@ it a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term substr@@ ates at specialist forces , but are future oriented towards the application of the application .
the overall concept should be focused on the inside and exter@@ n@@ ally , concrete measures for trans@@ verse forces and include a training offensive , require CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this list@@ ens to a good approach .
for the circuit it has to do with personnel problems , which was not known earlier than that .
other towns promote well officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is by a real contest competition of public employer . &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age due to the service .
so the highest time for hand@@ shake , so that even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , president of Staff of the CDU , goes beyond the party to his party .
he had long ago as long as he had long surprise at the Kre@@ ist@@ ag to a f@@ ist surprise when he presented the personnel cost , and the other parties f@@ ading .
nations &apos;d like to check all the possibilities you have to enter a withdrawal from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not in short term for a satisfactory solution , the county council with the unions - maybe even in cooperation with the circular cities - may also raise a pet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CDU , employees and civil servants are trying to pay better than the tariff for Public Service .
the sal@@ aries are currently being written in@@ advert@@ ised , increases or more money , if one changes in a higher level , who are oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have a little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO @-@ migran@@ t li@@ fe@@ eds
in Italy , NGOs want to use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , war@@ ned that they are not allowed to continue to follow these rules on their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ ie , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Minn@@ ie warning was a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a ship of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their team had worked together with tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ ism in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immig@@ ration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself as a detailed alleg@@ ations of Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we can not operate in the search and rescue area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can assess all debts that are currently collected and we can evaluate all the information and disc@@ ern the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the Italian authorities the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , had been monitored since October .
it is assumed that his crew will ship infl@@ atable migrants from tra@@ ff@@ lers who can drive them directly from human tra@@ ff@@ lers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can drive them back , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supp@@ os@@ edly found only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Ak@@ te des prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected to susp@@ end on the authority of Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons , and not from any other moti@@ ves .
under the code of conduct , boats as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a mainly have to board an Italian police officer , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessary but acceptable , since they would not have any significant changes or han@@ dicap &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who do not hesitate to sign the Nobel Prize @-@ winner doctors without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ ie said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy for the emergency measures , in the last few weeks have been severely rec@@ alled that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with the local bourgeoisie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who left those countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ ker , the &quot; Foreign posts &quot; and two guest drivers , met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nor@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of the Tri@@ als and At@@ trac@@ tions .
there were three easy guides available .
the apartment in the Wach@@ enh@@ eimer valley pointed out as a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was an welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
the view@@ points followed , partly on towers , of which one could walk far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the pre @-@ yellow planes .
in between there was a longer sailing p@@ ege , for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Market in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim on the second day .
once again a look@@ out spot was connected to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate intake .

after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best site - sporty and cultural - learned .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga for e @-@ sport
sit the Sport @-@ Stars in the future of computer consoles , instead of dri@@ pping the wind and weather on the stadium to fight ?
fact : E @-@ Sport has long become a serious business to become an lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great Stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high grass .
this also recognized the first federal property , which increasingly are increasingly engaged in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg won the beginning of 2015 by V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to in@@ spire a completely new target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Management of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the coming weekend , the FIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; interactive Club World Cup &quot; among which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the E @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real soccer must in particular place with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people go into the stadium even in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the temp@@ ting tried to conquer all possible markets , mainly the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets , than once a year the Federal Property entry into Asia only once per year .
how are it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the E @-@ Sports computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation FIFA World Cup can be challenged at competitive level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ gen was established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and by the Asian games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a right sport ?
for many , the performance is safe to need .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ y has also been dealt with the question .
E @-@ Sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports@@ - in Cologne , because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions show , which one can also find in classic sport , for example , elevated heart rate , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
it also need cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and attention to nutrition .
&quot; the smart player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ rob@@ y looks like problems : &quot; d@@ oping is getting more a topic . &quot;
controls were heavy with online games , and in the scene lack@@ ed the structures of classical Sports .
the scientists raise the high integ@@ rative effect of the e @-@ Sports .
players are international along the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no intercultural shirt .
a study by the consulting firm Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) announces fast growth in the E @-@ sport .
in 2016 there were 50 million euros in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , revenue is expected to be 130 million .
with nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is a little bit .
however the E @-@ sport isn &apos;t far away from the well established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte @-@ Consult@@ ant .
International are many countries already .
great markets are Asia and the United States where the explosion @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US Team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher invests in the e@@ Sports @-@ Race partner Uni@@ kr@@ n .
in Europe there is quite a lot .
in an Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ y , says F@@ rob@@ otic .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer team of the soccer league , according to D@@ utt , has been obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ f@@ B @-@ board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ al@@ gia to exp@@ ire , and the old times to clari@@ fy today is not enough anymore .
it is therefore to preserve the tradition of the association , but it will be the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ me too . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 13 July 2014 , Carter was sentenced to life because of the negli@@ gible killing of Conrad Roy , which took place on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is not east .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter could stay free up to the calling .
it was con@@ fron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both them had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter van@@ ished with tears in the eyes , folded up and folded down , as they were condemned .
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the Prosecutor &apos;s State .
&quot; they finished his life to do their own better .
she has not taken over responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no pity . &quot;
but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said that it was a &quot; awesome sound &quot; which they do totally regre@@ t . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not found that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spiritual disease have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said it &quot; no day when I don &apos;t listen to the loss of my beloved Son .
I wish that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to wear for eternity despite all my sor@@ rows that we will be for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that they would be trac@@ ed by the knowledge , &quot; that she will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or an ante for his children .
&quot; no more to have this only person who was together with me since my birth , is a pain , which I will always be with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to request another , committed suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide po@@ is@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters had revealed text messages that she encour@@ ages him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she arose , spring of a building , cook yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is to switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy , and ordered that they should benefit from any press .
the case divided the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter def@@ ended , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 because of its British co @-@ resident in Italy before being acquitted on two years ago .
Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a commentary in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserv@@ es compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain , is no co@@ incidence .
the FC Bayern takes a great season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a great season - there is no extra motivation .
anything else was there in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional piece of garments was very small , very small .
but as far as wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there was no Philipp Lah@@ ain@@ a and not a Manuel New York , he made the sign of Bin@@ d to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner was back , after its first use as Bavaria @-@ Kapitän . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the in@@ lay could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but it was possible to sign up the coach with the coach too .
not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was not chosen by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just chosen from the holiday of the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he was chosen .
sugar spread to those who want to make a lot of neutral who wants to keep in the mood .
so who was going to assume the legacy of Lah@@ m , can only take small extra motivation for only good use .
K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old served as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
on the right , this is his position , the white Bin@@ d on the arm .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this start@@ up as the one who can take the ru@@ der to hand in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had the g@@ lowing for all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal so that his lack of fitness to play ( foldable hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus hit the achievements of the Asia trip to link to the achievements of Asia trip ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le may not continue to stum@@ ble in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ let .
the thing folded quite good .
Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the def@@ ences , both ag@@ ulated sou@@ ther@@ ly .
the nam@@ eless Nap@@ oli @-@ storm had quite hard , it was also a few times successful in the game construction .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave that the result &quot; was not the way , as we hop@@ ing for that . &quot;
but he showed a ordinary performance at the Debut .
game changes , speed changes : &quot; for this style I was brought to it . &quot;
as unusual , this Bayern world still lived for the new length , one looked forward to the game .
Rud@@ y for example was in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but definitely six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting movement : &quot; what happens here I have already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he must not teach the new one more .
Al@@ aba Motiv@@ ated Ö@@ FB @-@ Women
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ FB ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ steps were reported just before the game on Twitter and the Ö@@ FB &apos;s all the best wishes .
the Bayern @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is virtually Kl@@ ub@@ b@@ mate of Ö@@ FB @-@ captains in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fi@@ e@@ bert with our Lad@@ ys .
the Austrian football team of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .
perhaps our ladies may well need the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el .
company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ Pot@@ ato Minister : economy lo@@ aders W@@ iss@@ ings Tempo
it was often in@@ compreh@@ en@@ sible , the relationship between the country and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Grün@@ e ) , was a Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and need@@ les at the same time the old Minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Know the desires of the economy to which Lem@@ on has blocked all Lem@@ on . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around here is Nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the bridge of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry will wait for the planning process until 2021 the building &apos;s right is to be completed .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ Sur@@ ge@@ al Trier , which is in the fore@@ ur@@ gent demand of the federal state plan .
the objective is to take operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Ministers , Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but international competing companies to support regional , but international competing companies .
at the moment , the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is aimed at the wine of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase the sales market in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish its own company , commen@@ ds the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier sees an additional incenti@@ ve for young apprentices , says the managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the compound Master testing and 2500 Euro , when graduates are self @-@ employed in ten years after the master &apos;s training .
the hom@@ e@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , it would be quickly to create facts , both in the same time without the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , principal leader of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , the Wis@@ sing wants to set mobility in the regional operation , so far 29 vac@@ anci@@ es are busy .
the I@@ HK calls for orders to operate more than external offices .
CDU faction Bas@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the Au@@ d@@ itors &apos; calculation , the country in 2017 , and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of regional roads as suggested .
Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country as it wants to solve the specialist in the region .
further expansion of the former broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the score 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ds Internet connections and abor@@ tions .
in contrast , the former Foreign Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind turbines Pro Wind .
the Green @-@ Group left Lem@@ on to April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she returned for four months because of in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi will change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - auto @-@ manufacturers con@@ fron@@ ted with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ Chair@@ woman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent options available as a driving restrictions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore went to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to restri@@ c@@ ater or to restri@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday , that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the company described companies as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
however , nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of the autom@@ akers , plants for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles sold out exhaust gases , also take what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the mighty Auto@@ companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the company try to avoid the fault of Volkswagen that could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called re@@ boot devices that could regul@@ ate emissions if a car was tested , but at normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused Audi , a system installed in order to circum@@ vent the emission regulations in Europe , and an inquiry which focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could well ass@@ ump@@ ed Volkswagen very fast : the luxury car manufacturer is wearing very disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately to profit from Volkswagen .

the city wants to protect Is@@ ar .
in order to join the Is@@ ar visitors , a raft of raft took place at the mor@@ nings of Munich , which has a special message .
who doesn &apos;t go on Saturday to Is@@ ar , there will be a big flo@@ at between Fl@@ au@@ cher and the Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ bridge .
and that &apos;s not a common flo@@ at , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building refer@@ at wants to solve .

it shows a gar@@ bage .
the pre@@ lu@@ de for a public campaign in order to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love is ... &quot; to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as protective mass flow .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ants and the laugh@@ ter against the g@@ rief
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most published Cart@@ oon strings , the cre@@ v@@ ases of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ean one still works and works on a film .
his message : laugh@@ ter , &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he ign@@ ited himself as a sign for happiness postcards by what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris the end of the &apos; 60s became breakthrough : with the release of his Cart@@ o@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
Mor@@ dil@@ lo took place in China in China .
and again , the artist was inspired by cities .
large , round Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he s@@ itt@@ eth his own data , even today at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favorites and watches to find a lot spread worldwide .
since six years he also worked on a animation and a TV series with its figures .
the major person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ less any test@@ es in its drawings that has a thousands of feet as counter@@ acting .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie that is scheduled to appear on the chin .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script will not be written by him .
therefore , he is preferred to set up the TV series , which is how its original drawings , which will be produced .
lav@@ ender from the Provence of climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in Southern France but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the Lav@@ en@@ del is rec@@ alled due to the conditions that are rec@@ eded against d@@ rought and diseases of the insec@@ ts , which are trying to find solutions that are trying to find solutions , large head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ en@@ del in Provence is effectively end@@ angered because plant in the past years was exposed to effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more .
this has impact on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a mic@@ rob@@ al bacteria , the d@@ warf sh@@ ades , and in very dry weather there is very many of it . &quot;
and it is a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil sp@@ its not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant patients with a large number of flowers we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ EN@@ TW@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are drawn into account include a better water distribution and slow@@ down the evap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .

the assassination of an journalists under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce will usually meet her plans for the coverage of the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through which organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ stopp@@ able drugs .
but in this day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what saf@@ er feel : you should take their children with the office , who were the purpose of ag@@ gression with Gran@@ aten in 2009 , or leave it at home .
safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ ale , ally .
they ask for repor@@ ter , names for each column - no evidence is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdom@@ inal inv@@ ents .
there is drug ad@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the sal@@ aries of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest break from violence , and during all the country , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto has left his office in December 2012 , and there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter , you can find the editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in the context of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deep felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , that shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; and hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ building . two repor@@ ter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ Shirts , which show its sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared issues , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
in 2010 , a special appeal was constructed in order to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated .
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are related to drug tra@@ ff@@ icking and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ derer &apos;s mur@@ der@@ ers are only rarely found in court .
with Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not good , although the terrain is yet more toler@@ ated .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , meeting a discussion about the discussion of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to turn my time in this workshop , &quot; says he .
&quot; as long as we know not the why we aw@@ akes all of you . &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the newspaper of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . it was forced out of his car and was shot down for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; 12th Flow . &quot;
the sc@@ orer went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing worth silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested in the United States last year and the ex@@ tradition in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a to become one of the bloody battles fields in the country , since riv@@ alis@@ ing fr@@ actions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it makes nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone can be shot or several people on the road , or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ een for drug may , which are larger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the d@@ angers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
in February , there was a publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the Rival fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have off@@ ended the sons , the gang@@ members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper ki@@ os@@ k .
the second fault was in that Val@@ dez does not force it , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , who had published the same story to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived such a long time to his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
in 2003 he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ folk , when he joined together with five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ sia and sold 50 US dollars to celebrate .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
at the time , the newspaper minist@@ ered a reputation to the cour@@ age@@ ous and hon@@ our@@ able coverage , and sales and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard tre@@ ble investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by one publication , in which they could read stories , who couldn &apos;t handle anything else .
eight years after the formation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Preis &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; for the Protection of Journ@@ alists on the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where ever they led them .
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug tra@@ ff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done about how many dead ... why did you not say what went on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team is missing Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse the friend , which was gener@@ ously with h@@ ugs and proposals , a teacher that knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there are always sitting at the same table .
now they wonder : was his love towards the routine ?
his death has also been forced to question her own statements about it in question as they do their work on the best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to move with their women , their children , their fore@@ most shops , their native line and landing run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ scen@@ ic and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells false , stay away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be mo@@ cked ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ ce met for security training , there were suddenly no cell phone allowed . days before , y@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside the heat , two polic@@ emen sought refuge from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were contrac@@ ted by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in sh@@ ear , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who were the governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the repor@@ ter went into the mountain landscape where the drug con@@ founded the fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three principal stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a ex@@ pos@@ é to state spending , which concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the State bar , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about it , who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it was done , so be careful when everyone in the city was white : that the restaurant is a favorite locally run by drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy which ruled the reg@@ aining Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost all the century all political levels .
recently , several pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter , about predic@@ ting incid@@ ents in this location , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military fall .
only a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best pro@@ found source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , we did know what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its slim body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez Office was dedicated to storage space for signs and st@@ ic@@ kers that prot@@ ested against the moral of journalists , because the employees had become something that they never had ever expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez lam@@ ented himself a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration of another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador No@@ ame disappeared for three days after Val@@ dez has been killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and told , based on DNA tests that it is its own .
in all the country , journalists became stronger , as they have written in organized protests , &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on streets and buildings .
at this day the Director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the fall of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with Govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez def@@ ended the authorities to ex@@ pressing journalists and to bring them to the truth , because they said the truth .
she has asked since then to be divided by the government , because she wor@@ ried that her rage has viol@@ ated its obj@@ ec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organiz@@ ational crimes , involved in the government officials and a general society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; wrote that repor@@ ter not only been killed by drug candidates , but also on the order of politicians and security forces involved with the organized crimes under a blank@@ et .
&quot; &quot; &quot; over the past year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die , because they would like that you hold the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
apparently , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one has forgotten the death of the blog@@ ger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
their body was found together with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Ch@@ etas map : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones were next to their ab@@ separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua to the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others do on how it did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z was publicly addressed to the drug cart@@ els with a guide on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for d@@ angers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased , as evi@@ d@@ ently the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue back and continue work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , gives that the drug tra@@ ff@@ icking him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and therefore I was repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on Friday last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce were sitting in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ ming at once .
a series of shooting plants with band@@ en@@ ri@@ vals and security forces near the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as promised by a number of cardboard messages in the region .
from the borders of the borders , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens hot in the vicinity - a further shooting gallery in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
among the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose pro@@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can only think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was murdered on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practition@@ er asked me to send it to the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten its enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , even though a fri@@ gh@@ tening .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been doing so well that experts have described as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that his shooting skin was of red@@ dish Braun - and they said they would have had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; awarded him as &quot; the imm@@ ort@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur , who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier that lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly good preserved condition has researchers that it as &quot; really worth &quot; describe , neg@@ lec@@ ted
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the Geor@@ gian plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn radio when he died on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
he met on something that appeared from the ambient rock of the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more detail .
the F@@ ossil used by it was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal in the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) to cover heavy earth .
after all this hard work the ready result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tw@@ ist just a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it wasn &apos;t sleeping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main aut@@ or Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is going to go to the science history as one of the most beautiful and best din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a walk @-@ in shell , probably threatened by the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the powerful Din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage in order to hide themselves before smo@@ kers , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is known as counter@@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have been allowed to mix well into its surroundings and to sof@@ ten their enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature in the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has been head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studies the wild animal , and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ er ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sheds and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the cont@@ empl@@ ation , a widespread defense method in the Tier@@ reich , meaning that the tip of the creature was dark as its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ady sh@@ ady is usual , the results are sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ pris@@ ingly , since the size of Bo@@ real@@ iz@@ ta in far the size of the today living animals exceeds .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by the car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , the evolution of the con@@ front@@ ation of the con@@ front@@ ation was favorable as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals who use the con@@ sh@@ ady - do you think of to@@ e , Zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and viol@@ ated as a prey , what is sign@@ alized that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong big @-@ tier behaviour on a massive , strong shar@@ pen@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs showing how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs cra@@ b animals of the chal@@ k time have to have been &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins reveals that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ers was red .
scientists will continue to examine the animal on critics above his life , including its preserved corne@@ a in order to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died out into a river and pushed into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland as they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it has completely covered with preserved skin , but also in three dimensions , and the original form of the animal is keeping , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks today almost as in the early ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
you don &apos;t need to use your imagination to re@@ construct it . if you are just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal di@@ odes , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur , which stood on two legs , the Earth went through .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ iz@@ ta , the din@@ osau@@ rs din@@ osau@@ rs was ch@@ ased by some of his fur@@ y ancest@@ ry .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta after the death in the sea broke and ratified in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he died on 21 March 2011 in Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine at Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the ro@@ asted din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ ament , and is fully from the mu@@ zzle until hip .
the creatures was on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips which rag@@ ged from his shoul@@ ders .
the researchers believe that the botan@@ ical plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was sh@@ in@@ ted by the western Canada , until a floo@@ ded river was floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater landing of the din@@ os@@ ri@@ ers keep his arm@@ ament into this item detail .
the stone remains of this special specimen are so good enough that the skin tre@@ ats still cover hol@@ ge plates along the din@@ osau@@ ri@@ ers .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko for National Ge@@ ographic has written such a level of the conservation as &apos; sel@@ dom as a profit in lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more it is ad@@ owing .
hide remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ ocaust of the skin , which bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers are divided into top .
I can count the sheds on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a joint @-@ chain coll@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ er@@ long St@@ aus and aff@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , at the end of the morning , about 20 people were injured during the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , at 17.00 hrs between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , during a we@@ ather@@ less than 30 vehicles , including trucks , are floo@@ ded .
beyond the exact number of injured there were no dis@@ closures .
it m@@ asks for easy to moderate injury , said one pol@@ ze@@ able pre@@ cher .
a large bid on rescue vehicles was at the accident of accident .
the A8 was completely closed in direction to Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a distance of approximately ten kilometres was back .
like a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter , there was also on the back @-@ road to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade refers to the markings of the vehicle , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive penalty .
a second accident on the A8 occurred shortly after 18 : 45 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a coll@@ ision between an auto transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone had experienced once again : nothing that sits on the train and sleeps .
or man &apos;s deeper into his work and has just a great idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
cometh the Schaff@@ ner and we@@ aves an uns@@ an@@ ft or strike the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the sam@@ pler ticket control .
one is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you need to score his seat and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a trial runs on two routes .
&quot; does the offer , we increase it out .
it is then expected to be available for many other remote trains in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said a subway station .
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train of the ticket profit without Schaff@@ ner .
however , in order to be able to use , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to booked an online ticket - what you can do in most passengers .
it is also necessary to have bought the DB Explorer app , which is why the most convenient way of ticket sales is anyway .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : you rises in the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Ticket . &quot;
a button on electronic alignment then appears out of the test customers .
the train cable runs on their mobile devices a message that the g@@ ast X is located in the train and the booked seat is Y .
comes the train conductor for the ticket control in position Y , he knows that a passenger with already valuable online ticket is seated .
you can continue to sleep , further silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the clients , one for the train - what is to use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without a ticket control by our train accompanying personnel , the DB navig@@ ates just itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows the passengers to design your travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Fern@@ s .
second plus : &quot; our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
those often travels , knows that next to del@@ ays and missed the ticket control will belong to the greatest doctors .
for often , in any case one of the members do not have all the documents necessary to use online tickets for the recovery of online tickets .
either lack of credit card or identity card or otherwise a document must be given .
the result are endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the evenings or large space and del@@ ays in the control of your own tickets and sei@@ ze the workers at the end of the time to concern other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also available for the connection of the ICE 915 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further towing numbers on the same route are not enabled .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose P@@ et ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any was sh@@ atter@@ ed by Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l until her core .
only one day after they arrived in New York City , the St. Louis bones sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police is killed just a 18 year old child , and it still stands on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was named there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when no one had posted information on her feed the information , Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed at its tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the field of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he thought for himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was for them and their fellowship is nothing new .
she got her mobile phone to get back to Twe@@ ets on the night to twe@@ ets over humans on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
there were photos of police band and people , cried , and out of a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they observed a live feed that a police station was faced with demonstr@@ ating dog before a group of demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another police station is his sh@@ ot@@ gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you all of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is not common , &quot; remin@@ ded in their statement .
&quot; this is not the kind of murder to which we are acc@@ ust@@ omed to us and which we can call . &quot;
in that moment I felt d@@ tel@@ frost .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return flight and went to the next day at home .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she repeated her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two next morning would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary movie , &quot; Wh@@ ose stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and the protest , the love and power loss , the strength and resistance , which consists of the point of human beings , who live in the community and filled the streets to claim answers .
as a he@@ ast with her daughter , wearing a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remembered not how I taught you when black people have to fight for that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened to today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and pulled it up .
it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have lucky to give you an experience , in which she has experienced no ek@@ lat@@ in rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authorities that was invited to a camp as the activ@@ ist on the possible non @-@ acc@@ us@@ ation of the Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined to a local business owner who made lunch .
they made ready bags and hal@@ lowed them to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to accept a new type of acti@@ vis@@ m for fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was as a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ail@@ ment Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organis@@ ing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l arrived at the Sab@@ a@@ ah @-@ Fol@@ ay@@ an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ film directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar did not want to document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question occurred Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to document or try to find a story which you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
as fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not cent@@ ered and we wanted to make it different . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ ge@@ al occup@@ ants .
his involvement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l the project , along with six other nati@@ ves followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose P@@ et ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s experience - to show that it is &quot; not a Messiah @-@ leader , but around a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved the most obvious list of participants in the film .
as a result , the documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose P@@ et ? &quot; sur@@ pris@@ ingly personal aspects of fer@@ ut life as she loves and mar@@ ries her husband .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain physical aff@@ inity at this work and of human people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moreover , Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black sw@@ ing@@ ed women in the wider Black Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three fo@@ unders of the movement , which led to the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identi@@ fying the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identi@@ fying herself as Sw@@ ul .
&quot; black , pregnant women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are strug@@ gling with different fron@@ ts .
black , pregnant women must wear the main load of all . &quot;
fol@@ klore voted to note that &quot; movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not the active type of action , &quot; in the distance from the distance to their identity , as the heart of the film .
&quot; it was the person who recorded this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it is no co@@ incidence , although she was in front of the front , because in a life of these cruci@@ fix@@ tures as a black , schw@@ ule woman stands as much on the game .
you can feel the energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared , but the r@@ ass@@ y links between the community and the police continue to stand .
fermentation is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she still cl@@ ed to a singing and she feels his memory ever since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love one another and assist .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers will discuss about Bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built long .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population in Be@@ atri@@ cally and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
the topic hardly cannot be cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; on Facebook page .
while they say one to the Bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) or &quot; Das would be real @-@ class &quot; ( Nicole Six ) , comes from the other side : &quot; need no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ume ) or quite simple : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars fire@@ wood ) .
while the fears re@@ building that a gallery offers more customers to the city , including those other shops , the opponents were afraid that the pedestrian shopping per@@ ished .
Moreover , the gallery is planned on the plot in which the farmers market hall is where 13 directors are sold .
it will be concluded with the start of construction .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - in fact , on the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying a weekly in the farm market for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the country are getting very happy .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to know that during and above all after the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also the same .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting &quot; .
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ eted in a Mark@@ thalle in the gallery appears on the height of rent .
the project is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva Kil@@ ic : &quot; what is the shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
whether Clo@@ thing , boots , dro@@ pl@@ omas or Super@@ markets : I find the super@@ flu@@ ous .
of which , there are enough in our city .
one sees how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is so important that at least the market hall remains at least .
because after all the goods offered are fresh@@ ly offered , mostly directly from the producer , and is low priced .
as you see , shop transactions in a shopping mall will be rented only from larger firms , because the rentals are often not able to be a retail@@ er .
pity , special shops are almost no longer and what remains of it , then will probably van@@ ish . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmers market during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA the solution - even on duration , if the bit Gallery is actually coming .
or make it the gh@@ ost bit gallery already , all shops from Bit@@ burg to drive out ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s simply not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market hall , it is because of the mad@@ ly many - how I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg does not have space more .
when the pe@@ asant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a proper simil@@ arity : artist creates the portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the fri@@ day of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost endless for cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ lights and hair@@ dressing , which were sent to all of Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the c@@ utt@@ ings from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ tics tried a 35 @-@ year sentence when she made a secret diplomatic report on the Wik@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called a Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A proper simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into their specialized competence in technology , computer science and art , whose convic@@ tion was converted by Barack Obama , having only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , like anyone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could not only look at the formation of DNA data - the many ways you can interpre@@ t and the har@@ der Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations , but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , which was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but since her doll had openly spoken about the identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the Sp@@ ion@@ ag@@ es@@ etz , computer was and theft .
due to the prison , its image was supp@@ ressed , so very that there was only one single photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which man@@ ring is clearly on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde bead is associated with which it was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos;@@ Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
in it the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic Ar@@ te@@ facts like cigarette dum@@ mel and chew@@ ing g@@ um , producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how this people might look like .
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; you led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany these articles , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and could not be photograph@@ ed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to do a DNA portrait .
the artist and her pris@@ oned M@@ use have been sentenced to un@@ adul@@ tery over two years , which led several letters over the course of two years .
they even made a copy of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lies Images , &quot; which had a future to predi@@ ct the exhibition , and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also the opening of the exhibition a little depth and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to allow the rigid per@@ missions that he should actually solve , further fl@@ aming .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in a copy of the gallery written by the gall@@ ing called Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in its family name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automated cerem@@ onies , whose foundation is gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) show how amazing , at least in biological respec@@ ts , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people are hop@@ efully to take care of what we are , and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous memories , also is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a own room is one page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a hands @-@ free speech in the hands of the United States &apos; discipline as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they have ch@@ ill your words , then they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; never leave the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ view , though I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition - as it predic@@ tive in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the m@@ asks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation , which are united with hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
this was also targeted at that time , as all in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic tro@@ users were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them to the wall , but I wanted to feel it as a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea , like movement that also stick behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide human hunting is in the G@@ ange for a professor at North@@ western University and a staff of the University of Oxford who had been sought to susp@@ ect a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with dead@@ ly injuries .
on Monday the arrest warrant were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts due to alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ á H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as shown by James Cook &apos;s Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ ls .
a detailed warning system was reported by the Chicago police authorities that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27th .
civil servants received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and took the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was yet declared dead at the place of events for dead , and investig@@ ating the handles as a murder while the police actively campa@@ ig@@ ning after the susp@@ ects , civil servants .
L@@ ath@@ em is an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation , that L@@ ath@@ em is now being ro@@ asted and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal case provided by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ person at the University and the Som@@ erville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; we are willing to contact the police in Great Britain and willing to help US Invest@@ ors on any conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able way . &quot;
the statement pronounced that war@@ n colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to make himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said that he would ask the susp@@ ect to susp@@ end the authorities .
&quot; the police has an idea of its position , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities can help susp@@ ect the susp@@ ects .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the buildings of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building , which had just received a av@@ enge tip that had just happened in apartment 1008 .
the police ra@@ ves the scene as a fierce lion .
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that it was not clear whether the incident occurred on the 27th of July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the sacrifice had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza released a explanation on the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice and resear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic pre @-@ house . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the rus@@ sian vic@@ tori@@ ous Mut@@ ko
Russian vic@@ tori@@ ous Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) was to be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a given stage of fil@@ ming of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA chassis was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the WA@@ DA in compliance with the code which describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ ation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain any thing that could give an opportunity for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list of criteria , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have to approved the investigation of the WA@@ DA license by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in publicly sponsored d@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we execute the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has launched an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not ad@@ mit anything , which does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales outlet R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v announced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but then added : &quot; we have said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
nobody said to accept this report un@@ conditi@@ onally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the D@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA of the execution of D@@ oping control in Russia .
it was not allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) supervision .
after a visit to the main quarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves to the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di sells no eggs for the first time
this distributed the corporate groups .
it handles a pure precau@@ tion that could not be assumed to no health to health , it was said in the notification .
from now on , only eggs are to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to be negative at fi@@ pron@@ oun@@ ding anti @-@ lung radi@@ ators .
Al@@ di would therefore produce clarity and transparency at his customers .
the start@@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or worse - fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent .
even if it promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not mourn .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ec@@ tivity , &quot; he said that the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed operates .
it is called people from the outside .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of measurement of staff commitment , it enables businesses to conduct surveys , speci@@ alities of an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite exec@@ u@@ tives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools used by companies to measure employees .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and in the three years has won with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and poll@@ s of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company pointing to a glance which units have most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives will have low influ@@ x results - so you can follow .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been published in sc@@ and@@ al , since then a former assistant has been published a blog post , which have been speaking with the people who have spoken .
for start@@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a rec@@ ti@@ ative business possibility .

and if the principal leader is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the judgment of public opinion has recorded the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his employees are po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ical , it can experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , worker @-@ flu@@ ence and sounds , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent has been used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or send it a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ar@@ sen@@ ing and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S general Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to track the dis@@ comfort of employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ ters sets up problems , those who have sat in offices in cities or states that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ ep@@ id inter@@ lu@@ cent faster and addressed .
&quot; I can be closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano who heads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment relationships . &quot;
company started to supp@@ ress Eth@@ ics , Values and Employ@@ ees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen , due to eth@@ ical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ and@@ al , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent her dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology for monitoring the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; said he .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ ters offer your software as service , and ma@@ sts the companies with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval by Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with the total capital raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and earned his total funding to $ 60 million .
this investment will hardly be sur@@ pris@@ ingly , in view of connected nature by companies , culture and Venture Capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff are expected to expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sil@@ icon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are glad , feel good to be in a company , and that the work that you will do is worth making it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and En@@ qu@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Conver@@ ters and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors are reaching R@@ end@@ ings when their portfolio companies run well . businesses are good when employees are w@@ ai@@ ded and engaged .
when the analy@@ tics @-@ Tools are third talking about commitment and the use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data concerning the employee engagement is important in the field of workplace culture .
but the data are us@@ eless if the manager of an enterprise does not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that change in the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees do not use .
&quot; if you ask 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; President of Consulting has seen the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow these employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and if you don &apos;t worry , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed that is now consistent with monthly surveys was able to initi@@ ate measures of the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so res@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize and organize a communication training in the company through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to add several teams in the company to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new in@@ sights on the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you will lose your customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA remov@@ es two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers ranked on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ c@@ els and show the back full of silence from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ certain minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are written in the summer cur@@ ses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return to the Water Centre at 6 : 30 am on the next morning .
&quot; this is the next three days a genuine T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CAA elim@@ in@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the players already fully packed times .
the compromise between the two days is more than one day , where the Bru@@ ins started post@@ pon@@ ed almost one week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ support the change in N@@ CAA , even if they will add another point of player to the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them for three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they just pressed them , they pl@@ u@@ cked away , they are great people .
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time will it really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will termin@@ ate their practices once the camp is finished , which has been subjected to the clear visibility of its fields by a adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the highlighted class , which will be a protective net behind a door post , no easy task to be .
Bru@@ ins are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a has dre@@ amed to give it a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far enough to think that people can rent out there and then to draw up a practice there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video wall of one exercise , it is a fairly good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best , with what we have .
so I &apos;m not wor@@ ried about too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties , and their results are shown below the original entry , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to recogn@@ ise possible detection messages , and they may be able to display possible findings from the original item .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the leading points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , of which many of them believe that they have also affected the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were over floo@@ ded in May with false stories , and Germany supported a plan to eliminate social media networks if they do not succeed , h@@ ass@@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of new facts is started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides knowledge , which stories of fact examine the third parties , people want to meet more context that they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah Su , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook is still working on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to his news feed to decrease false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
create a Com@@ ic novel : a Schloss in the History of England
in his younger past , the tiny Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a hat@@ ch for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher between 1970 and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of tur@@ bul@@ ent history of his comfortable seat in the wat@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ ver@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript from someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says so tired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to observe this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &quot; surrounded the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that was based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected .
&quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ party in the 1700 &apos;s , he says to the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; he says .
&quot; that is his Dau@@ men@@ ab@@ druck !
and he still smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kindled because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , it would be even better .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for som@@ eb@@ ody who struck with old par@@ rot , it is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England , and living almost four months in a ch@@ at@@ eau ( &quot; To be hon@@ est : I have given my Welcome to a little excess &quot; ) it seems to be beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; Castle , to study the archives and to study the many treasures and cur@@ ios@@ ities of the castle , just like the mon@@ ks paid tribute to walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the tr@@ ench .
he walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape people , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night , he drank , &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 when the last expedition , Elizabeth Ch@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des had arrived a decade later , the employees began to worry about the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , &quot; said it to the loft . &quot;
Tag@@ eb@@ ooks , Letters from the Time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , which would say , &quot; You could mean that Land@@ ing bor@@ ing bor@@ ing &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
boys , let all leave his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to place on a wider basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ots that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famil@@ ies of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pe@@ asant uprising began in this area and I thought that a insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are connected together ? &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; which the history of the Jesu@@ it Patent is telling the family of Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers &apos; , shown in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century is portra@@ yed his own fun@@ er@@ als , having filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was only dug then years later ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls came to be Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &apos; the gent@@ l@@ emen seem to be for debts , always leave debts and spend money for things they could not aff@@ ord .
other generations from Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ Men do their debt cr@@ ises by being rich @-@ old women - I present them as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking boys , with a talent in order to advertise . &quot;
after the end of its approach in the castle , Rho@@ des on the search for other unique write experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish game for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ äm@@ mer@@ m@@ ä@@ ki &apos;s territory , the territory of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , that has since then been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney did for him a special place .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Lady chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ental Valley in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team might want to keep the logo and the slogan in home .
at the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign a festival on the Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; to be beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; if the makers of the action have been on the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel since yesterday .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) do not really , write them on their yesterday &apos;s website .
&quot; but we use this measure to win your attention .

military re@@ forms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
each year in the beginning of August , the Supreme Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on retirement age and transported to officers .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the General Staff Building , as previously mentioned , but in the office of prime ministers .
under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five world vice @-@ president and the Minister of Defence , the Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
that were civilians in the Y@@ as in the over@@ number .
the government attrac@@ ts the trains at the military .
General Staff of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the Commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been removed .
since the failed coup , head of head Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and ad@@ miral were fired .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the Ex@@ ile @-@ Pre@@ dig@@ ers Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which sees the pe@@ og@@ an as a wire attraction .
for 486 people who would have been involved directly at the coup attempt , this week is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup had called Erd@@ og@@ an the overthrow of &quot; Wor@@ ry , &quot; since he would give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but did Erd@@ og@@ an the army really in the handle ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ certainty in the Military headquarters . &quot;
in the general Staff there are concern about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army that mani@@ f@@ ests himself among others in the abol@@ ition of the head @-@ ban regulations for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the Grand Cle@@ ans at the Army and the security forces is going to go on .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an added a further 73@@ 95 national service agents including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 female soldiers .
it seemed , when I t@@ opped the military at the military .
gener@@ als earlier than the actual lor@@ ds of the country .
three times they embar@@ ked on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world state regulations .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an ur@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say , Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s prec@@ urs@@ ing an Islam@@ isation of armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; was not so @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt on persecution from persecution against persecution , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if that &apos;s what NATO could not get cold , this could not get cold .
even in this alliance comes up in the alliance following the pur@@ ge of doubt the Turkish army .
leadership and operational capabilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; says Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changed the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. migration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he fore@@ sees to lower the legal immig@@ rants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for the cancellation of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is scheduled to be discussed in the two Cham@@ bers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will decrease poverty , increase wages and will save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will change this by the US , as well as citizens from other countries of green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
Ministry wants to re@@ construct road shuttle shuttle
again , during the past months , the past months has been cont@@ ested over the future of the service sector - now it should be very fast .
at the end of the year it is said to be built on the travel route , which leaves the tourist office .
in order to secure the long @-@ term service of the bicycle , according to the information of the Ministry of Transport , the project will be able to start construction work on this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order to order the route of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is especially important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ tor@@ ats@@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of maintenance of the route was reduced to approximately 2.5 million Euros .
from that sum , the country will take 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently defin@@ iti@@ vely matched , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the south @-@ ür@@ k railway as the operators are already involved in the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ti@@ met@@ able to have the used vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a duration of eleven years .
that should be ordered by the racing sti@@ ff shuttle on December 2017 .
the racing sti@@ ff shuttle is especially popular among tourists popular railway stations between the railway stations of Ilmenau and the race .
in the past months was tested in the course of a pilot operating system , whether the distance has been widely used by many people to order it again in the future .
the route is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the climb of sex robots is real , and we should worry about wor@@ ries
just as you thought it could not be more crazy about 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report about developing sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor of rob@@ ot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start to take up their ascent .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ ag@@ el .
&quot; people are fun with it , but the company supply every lot of it , and we will still be much more likely to see , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ ing said in the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed by their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone oil that feels warm - with deliber@@ ate human reactions to be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can custom@@ ize his robots according to its belie@@ fs &quot; and choose everything , from the eye color of the robot about the form of chest pain to the type or the color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will still be in@@ qui@@ eter , as many robots have the &quot; personal@@ ities &quot; who would look at a step@@ ford woman progressive .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to Ro@@ bots with a silicone oil .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to custom@@ ize their robot to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appe@@ aling as rel@@ ent@@ ment .
and then there is still the True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot with pre@@ programmed personal@@ ities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ ed the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ment and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality who has been adapted to your personality is as good as possible , &quot; heating the site of True Compan@@ ion .
so you like that you like , and it doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has its tuning , just like real people !
it can be we@@ ary , fixed in conversation , or she can be &quot; in M@@ ood ! &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects with this promotion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships , but the sub@@ inten@@ tional character properties that goes on rape , if one go to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : un@@ disp@@ uted ) Far@@ mers , be@@ ati@@ fied one most .
on his website the True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fat or just a different sex@@ ist .
her birth and its growing refin@@ ement demonstrate to a little dar@@ ker and deep@@ ening it in our culture , to an withdrawal from the ideal of equality between the gen@@ ders to a desire after having sex with under@@ going as an optional addition .
most men will naturally hold no sex robots , and while FR@@ R indicated its growing popularity , however , they remain unchanged at the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak out of the border zones can be le@@ ak@@ age in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or bel@@ ge , until them the free market gives the permission .
there is however , certain over@@ cutting that these highly developed sex robots in a period of time occur in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there has been a president in the White House , who led to have attacked women &apos;s sexually att@@ acking .
the most severe aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos;s &apos; ) are not the graphic images that counter@@ parts the body and the out eyes , but like realistic this vision .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it feels like a big jump .
the goal behind those sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) .
their genetic disorders would like to feel human being , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , at the point , when it comes to their personal@@ ities , the robot no real women constitute .
they cannot be split or simply away from their companion .
you don &apos;t have a medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing , which indicates in@@ depen@@ dency or anything that could inter@@ rupt the imagination total inf@@ ant .
differently , you are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the speech by 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to understand the word of healthy human mind
it is become one of the revolution era of the Tr@@ ump era that the political sp@@ ans who have the US voters split up also families in small format .
around the Christmas and harvest@@ ed festival there were newspapers in the USA with suggestions about how to have to circum@@ vent the hor@@ ror of the tr@@ ump .
we ex@@ iting us all to supp@@ os@@ edly on our filter bub@@ bles .
less notice was the power of tr@@ um@@ ps , families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ directional dip that lives in Chicago since a long time with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that the unity could have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side .
in order to find the dining table this is certainly a good cause , but it falls to me in another context that this also provides considerable risk .
the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the excell@@ ency effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; normal@@ ization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ acious possibility of getting us no longer a day .
there is , however , a more fri@@ ght@@ ful long @-@ term scenario in which the Republi@@ can rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing are normal@@ ized , &quot; which at once compared to its standards suddenly appeared as in@@ tox@@ icity of failure .
today I found myself of an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney ur@@ ic version of the re@@ trac@@ ts - the dog on the car , which looked at least 14 % income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax returns ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild criminal off@@ ences occur .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify for themselves as an un@@ meas@@ ur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel at Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ab@@ ells of the New York parking department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not use caffeine .
the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ushed and the animals turn to look back through their own shoul@@ ders - extremely dark and growing music convey@@ s this on a notable way .
as many Kl@@ isch@@ ees disappointed a city : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are familiar to provide a great exc@@ itement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
five and thirty years later , and I am still not yet left over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the North London .
the Central Park @-@ Car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since there are two two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and all have a great time .
when I had to rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately , nobody else has asked .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store in this week , my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars , before I was able to pass my credit card .
at the corner of my road it is the same thing , plus the option to balance an average of 15 % tip - this to purchase something about the cargo .
this doesn &apos;t result in a slow@@ down of what actually a neutral exchange should be , but ex@@ erts pressure on the server to enter Personal@@ ity into a situation which is not necessary .
the poor woman at the department store stood exc@@ ru@@ sting , while I tired the experience gained my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain in the hospital moved
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital .
in the past year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of inc@@ itten , to the hospital , which he suffered in prison , according to a fall in his cell .
pist@@ ol was sentenced to death against a first death sentence against murder of prosec@@ uting attor@@ neys .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s early morning in 2013 by sending them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on them .
Pist@@ ori@@ us maintained that he hid his gir@@ l@@ friend for a night int@@ ru@@ der who hid themselves in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to state this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell which they say they would be too dense .
the National Prosec@@ ution authority said that it would be lifted up against the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is running danger that his penalty will be increased to 15 years , if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer was an aston@@ ish egg
as the last of the flower schools , the quad@@ r@@ asp@@ ir@@ rig@@ ation of H@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into school holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the discharge students go to the Gymnasium , four at the secondary school .
instructor Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen during the day evening .
as a symbol of the school branch , the 29 pupils of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der grows a young e@@ ag@@ les that grows in chick@@ ens , but nevertheless however , put away into freedom .
in addition , the M@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; The e@@ ag@@ les in the chick@@ pe@@ erhof . &quot;
farmer Arnold took a strange egg , and let it brood from his chick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken breast , a small eagle came out .
yet the hope that came out of him a chicken , spread the e@@ ag@@ les on a high mountain of its wings and sw@@ elled .
thereafter the classes were three and four in the training of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens d@@ ances with the young Go@@ ck@@ les who bore cylinders to bet .
the eagle stand for integration , said senior manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
indeed , the young would be different than the other young k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but this will be .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wish every four @-@ kl@@ äss@@ ler to feel himself in his new school .
it was followed by grat@@ itude to the colleagues , the earlier school conductor Michael Müller , who again jumps on teaching courses , and the par@@ ental in@@ corporate .
the cu@@ cum@@ b is now over , declared class@@ teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons are only very inv@@ alid , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the quad@@ r@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler .
for completion , all students took a Song from summer time and holiday season .
thereby , there was great joy with the children .
eight first ranks for the new school year have already registered .

software update for diesel vehicles : what does the data subject need to know
how accurate is the software update ?
need diesel drivers to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers .
for a total of around 5.3 million cars , the BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emission behavior of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europa are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negoti@@ ated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates have only been valid for vehicles that have signed Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced an in@@ correct implementation in the next months , but not an exact date .
Daimler has informed to write every person concerned .
when anyway be a inspection , this will be done in its frame .
how long does the switch@@ gear shift into a total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; said S@@ met@@ anin .
the connections on the engagement of the manufacturers , as well as from the political print .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , will@@ ingly did not act on the environment at the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will it take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours during the workshop .
timing always could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , do not drive the car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE to wait for waiting .
probably , foreign producers would have to follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE does not fear this .
but to the regions where driving force are threatened .
in rural area there is no impair@@ ment losses for older diesel .
the ACE will have to wait with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center awards
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glorious events in the Washington .
the first prize ceremony of President Tr@@ ump promises to be polit@@ ically .
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first Rap@@ per to be one of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution on Thursday , there were also singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ograph@@ ical Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and TV @-@ producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) .
the awards will be delivered to the beginning of December .
traditionally , US president Donald Tr@@ ump will stage a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the award ceremony .
the L@@ ear award winners announced with a progressive TV series announced that it would have been to participate in the gala &apos;s gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post @-@ presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lec@@ ting the arts and human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , they will use the interview with Tr@@ ump to clear their visibility .
according to the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former premier@@ es are the Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ hab@@ ad City Buil@@ der , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the place is already extinct - suitable applic@@ ants are r@@ ar .
for 31 years she has been a wood@@ chi@@ pper .
and the work gives him great fun as he convey@@ s in the Press Conference .
it reports from varied but challenging tasks to wait for his successor .
at the same time , no application satis@@ fies the profile profile .
the city looks for the nearest point of time a architect or building engineer .
thus - under the cont@@ emp@@ t of the regular period of notice - still enough time for an el@@ aboration .
since Has@@ lach joined the administrative authority as a sub @-@ building authority must pres@@ elected the applic@@ ants .
for this function will keep the city on any case .
if they cannot be filled out , they would have to leave their citizens up to Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity of the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker that reports from a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens .
more than 30 years ago , some important projects have been collected on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it safe to the building site and his employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ ary parking lot .
the se@@ venti@@ es between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still on the topic .
the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; estimates W@@ acker .
&quot; everything in all are great tasks on my successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design theore@@ tically be present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ aker large games room .
with ha@@ zel@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener , he could be re@@ flexi@@ bly re@@ acted to multi@@ ples .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of green systems become often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to have it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , st@@ resses the separ@@ ator .
drilled in the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything goes on my table &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many long @-@ time employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been around for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) has been for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the more design of the city .
if Roland W@@ acker wants to inherit Roland W@@ acker , should have completed his studies as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with special knowledge of architecture , and have good skills in the areas of construction and building planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ Office under@@ stands high and deep construction , building guide , mir@@ under@@ ing issues , administration of urban property , municipal court with building yard and city gar@@ dener and Lower construction rights including monument protection .
bike on pipes are thrown : south @-@ ground
according to the police , the blue bike had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway station over the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so bad@@ ly damaged , that the her@@ aul@@ ting goods must be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpet@@ rators , and look for the night hours after them .
close to the facts , by witnesses , a ros@@ ar@@ oter driver and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ying crisis , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators themselves have brought themselves in great danger and end@@ angered train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , the delay time and the charge for rail traffic could also come to the perpet@@ rators of the rail service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic could be led without disabilities .
there were almost ten personnel ho@@ ists fallen out in the morning , two of which were concerned with correspondence .
they didn &apos;t count that they had late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced around 200 metres of upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help , IB@@ D ( infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel diseases might be left .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the US , causes mag@@ nets and blu@@ epr@@ ints , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those interested party usually come to avoid meat and milk products , researchers found at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an of proteins work to develop immune cells which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells were pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the body , not into the body .
cells that are able to remove inflamm@@ ation , are balanced of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive t@@ issues .
when equilibrium is dissolved in the direction of inflamm@@ ation , it may cause a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , a type of tolerance sub@@ mitting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their in@@ wards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ias - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
it proposed that the combination of L. slow@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an rich nutrition is toler@@ ant , less anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ ther@@ us if the same system also promotes people with people .
the post @-@ doctoral prizes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an is looking for a kind of immune cell that had been found that a group of study en@@ closures had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but they had not been accommodated .
they suspected that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gast@@ ro @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
the hardness of mice became DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacter@@ ias found in mice and immune cells , but without them were missing in mice .
mice were taken up in a ster@@ ile environment so that a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ om was missing and they did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria break the immune system into the immune system and then caused small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed among the toler@@ ant convey@@ s cells .
as the active component of the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be known as a by @-@ product of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an met@@ abolic ism that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of cells were hal@@ ved by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an declared that people have toler@@ ant powers of toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect it from our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an products from L. slow@@ ter@@ i found the cells in people like in mice but defects in g@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells are inflamm@@ ation on the inner surface of the Dar@@ ms .
potentially , high tr@@ ypt@@ oph@@ an@@ ism in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to a expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; Genius &quot; to Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
in Manchester United , Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho is signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pound Sign@@ ature from Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and im@@ pressing in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation of the blues tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho had to leave the Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he th@@ inks - he th@@ inks ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him , previously ready to be ready . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u at Avi@@ va stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho is his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent Un@@ veil@@ ed in this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho would still wish three new comm@@ it@@ ments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of its four mandatory new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three from four , thanks to the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the pilot flo@@ ats of Seattle in the US state in Washington , but drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , that are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar paras@@ ols , the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a cardio test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .

new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turned out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was the SPD boss , the Prime Minister of Ministers met , always with a certain concern in Berlin .
only no distur@@ b@@ ance from the party center , merely no contra@@ sting of the federal government - this is the most important desire of elec@@ toral body .
Martin Schulz has changed the party since Martin Schulz .
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus and increasing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with consideration .
there were deep stro@@ kes .
and one after another .
the Federal CDU sees under the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply feel reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the CDU @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber editor network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising freight operator of a Green @-@ M@@ EP@@ s has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party , Michael Kell@@ ner , has called the ab@@ hor@@ n@@ ful Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ li@@ fe@@ jack@@ ed , called its mandate .
the Over@@ comes of the CDU means a clear anti @-@ f@@ ake of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and Election Poster of the Green Party to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not be even true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ ted a SPD election campaign , when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message first met the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the survi@@ ving of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU without own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small cr@@ ises in the SPD @-@ Land feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the missions began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland Parliament in March .
a blue eye , no more , the com@@ rades was cal@@ med .
according to the State elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
so that was - even though it was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the role of the SPD , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite lead the party smooth .
again , the com@@ rades re@@ joined in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had exhau@@ sted the courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him there was the next blow .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD country , lost its Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie during his weekend , while his city burned .
and because he did in the crisis communication so quite everything wrong , what can be done wrong .
since then , fire@@ wood is strug@@ gling for political survival .
now also Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ emissions aff@@ air and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister had already been in criticism for some time since a long time .
Mi@@ ese outline values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe even in the past few weeks , Weil tried to set acc@@ ents with acc@@ ents .
the goal of the former civil master of Hanover , to expand its power in Berlin , was also not hidden in the field of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him , since they spoke of because a stabil@@ ization of the party .
now , the exact opposite may occur .
because of the part@@ ake of the part@@ ake , the Sax@@ on green is no gu@@ ilt in the region .
and Schulz don &apos;t even know .
in this case , the com@@ rades have to be closed , keeping its own rows closed .
your anger is governed by the green , and here especially on the tr@@ apped par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and dem@@ ocrac@@ ies , like Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets her own career opportunities over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of part@@ n@@ ines in the SPD commission , the editor Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected as direct de@@ file , but on the state list of the Sax@@ on Green Party , so the Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties further .
the logical consequence is that it returns to its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliament , compl@@ ained an &quot; dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ onal man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate was clear four years ago : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people have done Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says E@@ ND at the Lower Saxony for the general election of the German Bundestag . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the personal career of the future of the CDU in the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded to solve the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there is more or more going on the CDU of Lower Saxony has been given .
funding of the town centre III
those who want to relax in the years can get away from the country soon .
furthermore , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ste@@ ady city development on Wednesday were in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler had a look back to the events so far .
since 1991 , there was a s@@ iting regions .
then , in the San@@ hed@@ rin , I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II between 2005 and 2016 , the grant was even 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the current renov@@ ations are an &quot; success project &quot; - it was finally important to promote the interior development , and not only complete new building areas .
on April 4 we received information from the Mayor of Karlsruhe to obtain information that there will be a san@@ itation zone III .
the sum will be charged 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which you would need 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the municipality .
how do you create a san@@ itation zone ?
you will continue to examine the Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area at all level of interest , to re@@ ate .
if necessary , the area limits may also shift once again .
the Ste@@ g Schools on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations will then be conducted .
core of the program are the revol@@ ving of inner capit@@ als , the improvement of the residential and working conditions and the expansion and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be property , i.e. , per land , is carried out .
the san@@ itation zone would eventually be established as a statute .
the approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the inventory of the investigation began to fill a questionnaire in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation region .
as of November or December , the set of movement is scheduled to begin with the renov@@ ations coming next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commune must perform the encour@@ aging pre @-@ investigations .
it &apos;s a thing to evaluate the city of urban areas and decide when is san@@ itation and in what extent is .
it will be registered in the land register for the respective land .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would come again after a sensation , and make a picture of the situation , promised them .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project would be the holding of the involved .
therefore there will be questionn@@ aires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and bound@@ ary bow , &quot; where it is among others about construc@@ ting the building and the rehabilitation .
in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; forms , data , spl@@ itting and inhabitants of a residential space can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only sufficient if the building business premises are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel showed that , Got@@ zel showed that a filled questionnaire will not be an application for funding .
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler has stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; wind @-@ principle &quot; - who first comes first , m@@ ah@@ lt first .
you could not book &quot; reservation for later &quot; at a time . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Local II &quot; were shown to make the ab@@ sent a refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office and even start his office with a hand@@ ful movement .

the cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers to thousands of thousands
the decision of the White House , a Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter to fly to the South La@@ wn , will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers after the data of the military , which were issued to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on 17th July in the White House with American building programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 States .
beside a yacht made in Connecticut , a fire@@ brig@@ ade from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi was exhibited in Connecticut .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in an frag@@ ment@@ ary order or FRA@@ GO , hardly 36 hours before helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , unit , responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I only wanted to be aware of that , because there is such an ordinary event with high visibility , &quot; the Commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event on the eve of the event , the representative of the Nav@@ al Pre@@ sidents of Aviation .
the news shows that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos; clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn at 15 : 00 a.m. , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
note : note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight .
during the event , the original air@@ crew was at the helicopter , while security personnel remained at the ground during the time .
from the TI@@ ME provided records , it wasn &apos;t clear that ultimately , a second flight crew was necessary .
the Hatch Act prohib@@ its federal property to use government property for political purposes .
data records show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked if the event could not viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts , and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political tor@@ ch .
at the event , the President gave a violation of reform of health reform , which was in the Senate in the G@@ ange , and he propag@@ ated efforts to help protect the government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from polit@@ ically important purposes .
Pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but your use only requires for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February by the presidential plane before the background of his first campaign against r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presi@@ dential Train through its predecessor .
the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states will be made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Chairman of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 Occup@@ ation frequently perform training trips in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn through to depos@@ e the US president in the White House with precise alignment .
as Tr@@ ump in July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 resulted in the White House 58 exercise consultations .
the flight for &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted among the training needs of the airline &apos;s crew for the month , said an official .
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential supporters . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were no longer pro@@ ps on the event , which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in this helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have a budget drawings for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ff of the US Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D Group for the V@@ H @-@ 3D was , however , 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the plane recorded flight time by plane from the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers at the basis of the estim@@ ations made by hanging points is highly ir@@ re@@ leader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates contain staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from the year 2015 , the charges apply to Do@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract statements .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , S@@ ean Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week of things that are made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ reless work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is reasonable to raise it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t clear that Tr@@ ump was inter@@ act with helicopter when he entered his tour via the South La@@ wn in the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire brig@@ ade .
at the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and Ash@@ er with the media over his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

team manager Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay at least respect before the enemy .
&quot; it is a compact team that is still playing in quite similar formation .
just on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV . especially the imports from the far north .
&quot; whose Dan@@ es and Fin@@ als can even refer to applications in the Davis Cup .

&quot; this will be tough for us . &quot;
there you need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high North is practically standing .

how America should harm the OMV
truly happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he had signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for the deep@@ ening of the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his haste , the law en@@ acted a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even in Brussels was bad@@ ly damaged against the U.S. balance .
after all , the draft stipul@@ ates to approach European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
accordingly , since then Invest@@ ors of the local OMV , co @-@ funded with other European firms , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic line North Stream 2 .
the threat@@ ening is mighty .
nevertheless , it would be too early for an estim@@ ation of consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump must raise the sanctions by an executive order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been viewed what the Group could play and which could really do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back to the city : 46 kitchen environment
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch bench again .
with firm contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban kinder@@ garten .
on September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld will be taking over the municipal care facilities in the municipal day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head in the Department of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we all pleased all of us . &quot;
the bo@@ iled is still bo@@ iled out of the house : a Cat@@ erer assumes that task and delivers fresh bo@@ iled cooled .
the city operates in the field of area 46 kinder@@ garten , in 44 the children are getting a warm meal .
in the last year , 2800 children were at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; in the meantime there are not only children who are attended by 45 lessons , at K@@ ita in K@@ ita , &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children are up to 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Par@@ liam@@ ents have served daily from the 1st of September , offering the dishes prepared , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individual , washing the food , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two group@@ ings as well as seventh troop facilities - decides on the ti@@ met@@ able circumference .
&quot; the kitchen shell is now qualified for the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is also said : healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; children should help to prepare food . &quot;
direct access to the kitchen @-@ power &apos;s team is meaning@@ ful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have known a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not to inter@@ change people . &quot;
continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far the job of the kitchen forces - is now done by special cleaning agents in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm which they made up in the cost comparison between own reg@@ ression and foreign assets for the city as the most economic government , called it from the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ tim@@ ers are new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational area not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ laid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really prestigious and cre@@ dible if women are not restricted and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections take place on April 5th .
the Taliban have published thre@@ ats against a election process that co@@ inci@@ de with the transition from international mar@@ tial arts to an ad@@ visory role .

G@@ MB proc@@ ession on investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union who would like to make a union with managers of the bis@@ cu@@ it producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie about the long term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company weighs only about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , besides other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea K@@ ek@@ se .
in recent years , Mc@@ V@@ oting Ow@@ ner said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he explained that employees and trade union representatives &quot; would be experienced as the first , if their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s demanded &quot; concerns expressed concern that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be presented . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clari@@ fication on the needs of business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , aff@@ ecting our members .
generations of families have been working here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Glasgow , an important pillar for de@@ cent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and pro@@ sper@@ ity , and from the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the increasing life costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow ur@@ gently need a floral production value at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross took only yesterday a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , because we appreciated continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB experts at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all the companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e economic climate , our business cycle , and that applies to all our business domains and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the Heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross &apos;s production site and quite an end . should our business processes change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona war@@ ned three years ago in front of Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the page of La League may regre@@ t your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not leave persecution in their persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar for a quote of £ 189 million , but they have been war@@ ned of three years ago in front of the world record ?
the spectacular approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double of the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba went back to Manchester United in the last season .
after the completion Ne@@ ym@@ ar is the most expensive player in the world and the highest professionals in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way without constra@@ ined , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sted that the club has always given its best to take care of him from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but the football world was war@@ ned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before that view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi was a strict warning for each association to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not concerned , knowing that if they touch one of our players , we will contact them in opposition to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Al K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players in their sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish Club in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G medium field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G did not make it clear that they could not allow it to travel to the International from Italy , while Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by playing one of their prize packages for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report dra@@ fted by the Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report about the loss of the abuse of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report of the abuse sc@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continued on discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ person of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced its publication against the German press agency , he earned the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Not@@ ary Pope Benedict XVI .
it would be very serving to the appearance of the Catholic Church when Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express its deepest regre@@ t using their own sub@@ missions , or at that time in@@ correct evaluation of the operations .
on the other hand , the Vatican company &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that the coverage of violence in the dom@@ ination of &quot; two hundred measures &quot; was measured .
regarding the over@@ terms in Regensburg no one nobody believes that it would have to be &quot; dirty and damage &quot; in future , but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ i@@ ia , the author and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the acc@@ ust@@ omed to design@@ ate the Catholic church as a source of all evil experience is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion about that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here also Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go on the church , and this is a bound F@@ Y . &quot;
in addition , they pointed out that in their adolesc@@ ence , it had been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical agent , &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one was ready to be done . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to use today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world have changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse , also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared .
entirely to wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who was written with R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says E@@ zek@@ iel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report written by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg at the re@@ conn@@ aissance team Ulrich Weber has presented himself ?
in a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high pl@@ aid &quot; victims of over@@ took , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ ans sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; together , we hold that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
even with high e@@ motiv@@ onal@@ ity , the punishment for the pupils could even be even more severe .
nonetheless , in contrast to many other people , however , many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. R. , and therefore in numerous cases linked to him even positive memories . &quot;
in the interview E@@ emann , why the final report of the abuse sc@@ and@@ al at the Reg@@ ens@@ ke Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger closes his mind on his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the incid@@ ents of violence against protection agents at the Reg@@ ens@@ ke Dom@@ spar@@ rows , &quot; there is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for an raise many students his &quot; humanity &quot; .
for the others it appears as Chol@@ eri@@ as and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was designed by the Ö@@ f@@ teren . if a domain kit was musi@@ cally superior to top performance .
how do you use the Bio@@ graph this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must ask oneself more , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is coming to it at all .
once eight sides are dedicated , and it is clear of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ation or co @-@ dying from the terrible suffering of sexual abuse .
the violence ex@@ cess@@ es at the Pre@@ school took place outside of its re@@ sphere .
you may fall before him in the case of having experienced , or first quot@@ ations have not taken seriously enough .
the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ ist gram@@ mar school , on which he worked , was taken from practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
in this way , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger makes a very excellent record , &quot; a very popular &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; under@@ stand@@ ful teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes , cookies and swe@@ ets , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high motiv@@ onal@@ ity that led to wi@@ ping out even times .
that he didn &apos;t only threw the chairs and the key and the key on the floor , but also ear@@ nest moved and too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys to the hair or ears , he himself has deeply sad@@ dened and exc@@ uses .
however , at its hon@@ or@@ tion it must be said that such correc@@ ting methods in the frag@@ ment period , the 1960s and 1970s , were common to parents as with teachers .
do you still know such ch@@ att@@ ing methods ?
of course , I think of all of us who was born before 1968 .
I also saw this in a world@@ ly school , a state gram@@ mar school .
compared to what actually is about this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violent taking on the pre@@ school , the fre@@ il@@ ich Bag@@ at@@ ellen were .
there you &apos;re asking if it was not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ iness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media over@@ threw him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e , there are many who never understood him , still in fri@@ g .
but the truth is : the report dra@@ fted Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about mis@@ use of abuse among the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen took place in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be put into consideration either sexual abuse on sexual abuse during the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never seemed to speak to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me everything very embar@@ r@@ assing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , but is that most victims of shame .
if they were not familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then definitely not a ch@@ oral leader , he would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do I rate the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ably disciple formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he would have had been kept confi@@ denti@@ ally and would have occurred to the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really ab@@ sur@@ d , assume that something is ur@@ gent or clearly open , as compared to their parents , Inter@@ nat@@ s@@ led , Confi@@ dence instruc@@ tors , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance , the interested students and / or their surrounding areas could not be confirmed as part of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as regards sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free from everyone .
thus it cannot be t@@ ossed to him , unable to prevent him or have brought it to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to bring his good name in conjunction with these contra@@ sting crimes , as it was done in some cases .
in the media , there was a lot of &quot; Viol@@ ex@@ z@@ esses &quot; at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ atzen atzen station .
the earlier cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be presented in the &quot; Weg@@ ener . &quot;
must he live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem that in the coverage of everything was missing and men@@ hi@@ des to a giant mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent sei@@ ze and somewhere in the middle of the country , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what mis@@ use of the report .
there is then clean : between the primary school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other charges .
Moreover , the report deals with the events of the period since 1945 , also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ orus of the dom@@ ination of dom@@ ination .
the whole horri@@ fic test education , the cases , in which child of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were sh@@ atter@@ ned and were horri@@ fied , all of that occurred on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sk@@ ill@@ ful states have to have occurred .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got her only her face when they were already at the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ ist gram@@ mar school .
in which , as the very most witnesses came , the theme of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ a@@ ean &quot; states .
what else was at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ist gram@@ mar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but there was no sa@@ dist@@ ic power .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , at which the report comes to conclu@@ de that &quot; many victims were estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in numerous cases linked to him even more positive memories . &quot;
so no more the repro@@ aches to have been removed .
but despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by states in the pre@@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just began to establish and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he didn &apos;t work and responsible ( so the witness ) would not hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
can Georg R@@ atz@@ inger wear the ears along the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ist ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
in this way , he indicates that in the pre@@ school , he will continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot;
prior to the risk of neg@@ ativity , it will already be ur@@ gent in@@ sist@@ ence .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was only banned in Bavaria .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , just as everyone knows of us .
it was difficult to estimate the fact that the affected might have been ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic and where really the allowed limit was exceeded .
you can &apos;t say anything , he would have gone ast@@ ron@@ ed .
that is not true .
only in 1980 , the study was finally abolished in Bavaria .
Fürst@@ in Gloria of Th@@ urn and Taxis is said to use it un@@ fair , today to address ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &apos; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , which is present to today &apos;s moral dimensional chain .
the prin@@ cess has quite right .
but this is not true of course for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ ov@@ able to all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s sins , that goes far beyond that .
this is all very fear@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it is finally processed .
but at the same time , I have to use Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him .
his funds to discipline and ra@@ vening , thus ear@@ ring and shoul@@ ders and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment is then prohibited , it has also kept stri@@ pped away from it .
what picture of his ra@@ iny days has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &apos; ?
came the subject of testing even to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only one side role .
yet , I didn &apos;t let any means that he led a str@@ ay shelf there .
but it has to be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without requiring un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly possible to form a institution of world tran@@ splant@@ ations , true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition , which went directly to the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
at bis@@ cu@@ its and Bon@@ ets alone one of the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys only makes no big singer and before any success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ winding .
what kind of man , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really learned to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and always come back as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , gr@@ acious and heart of good people , of whom you can not imagine that he could not do something like a fly .
I &apos;m getting regular , just as many former domain names still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and they will treat him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him today , that he once was strictly speaking to them , thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are today than@@ k@@ ful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teachers - a str@@ ingent father , eat that may be - but also a love respec@@ t@@ ful Resp@@ ect to which she still has today and honour them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again : all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all things you have made him , are educ@@ ated methods that were at the time of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can be glad that we have overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because it is promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin .
there is the evil int@@ ent that stands behind it is only obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it on him .
now the call areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps even Germany would probably have to know the Reg@@ ens@@ ity of Lausanne , finally in peace .
