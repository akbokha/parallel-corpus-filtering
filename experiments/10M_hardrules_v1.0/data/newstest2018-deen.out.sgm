<seg id="6">It nerves when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to be offended up because the car-Navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the new Bayern Atlantique, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the State government, are all other than current - but is therefore very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online card.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how the cities and communities in the area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a Flicketed carpet, one recognizes as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The great postcard map were collected for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called urgence sheets.</seg>
<seg id="13">This originated according to the Bavarian Ministry of Measurement between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French troop occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wish an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even when French troops were finally removed from the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: the idea of today's neighbours, who created the idea of a widespread Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian settlement management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The origin for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">In comparison Spring / Today the state capital is most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is an sendling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the establishment of the map, i.e. 1877, capital of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today subsendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses subscriptions are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plingerstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian farmer against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can't see anything as fields - at first glance: in the illustrated map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called 'Ural, "which was derived from the property tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no more farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of sub-sendling.</seg>

<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59, the Munich club-Irrenanstalt "was produced" At the Auer fan. "</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden initiated the institution - that psychiatrist, who had been killed in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>

<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colour has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to the state after dissenting politics and racial attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which will take effect until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, because a number of fragment losses incurred in the entire state and notice that it is stated in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently revised law of Missouri, which makes people serious, discriminate discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, disproportionate the group, disproportionately release the group, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the rights to pass through people.</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such an incidence that we haven't heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist violation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at the beginning of the year, after that during the voyage through the state no more fuel had, and by the police of Missouri was accused of being accused of being accused.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also shows a recent report by the office of the Prosecutor's office, which is shown that black motorists will be more likely in the state 75 per cent more common than the White.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>

<seg id="64">The itinerary is also a response to a new Missouri law which would be more difficult to complain a company for residence or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberet Union (ACLU) had issued travel agreements for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration authorities to commit people to forgive men because of immigration agreements, which will contribute to the view of ACLU for further reinforcement.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel agreements are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but at the last time, stakeholders have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fencing project is Elementar</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman's electric fence project is a success project and is continuing in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestagsled Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the case of the excavation of the family of Schwenkann met representatives of the CDU Area association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwenkann offers insights into operation in which he managed to cultivate 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as many young kittens and houses in five homes Ferienges.</seg>
<seg id="72">The Black Forest milk "is an alternative to the alternative to the milk of its cows, so swivelled in the milk of his cows.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferihegy, only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the "Elemental Project as" Elementar. "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit margin on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green land care for a lot of work, much to be machined by the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the terms and the topography," stressed Valdemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elterous operation and transferred this without chemical plant protection and fertilization, even if it doesn't lead a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the community has recognized the importance of the electric fence and is happy about the leader funding."</seg>
<seg id="80">With costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare the farmers should have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">One hope that it could be pulled out for a while still a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they continue their operation," stressed the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often found in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in the year 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure of the area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of the commune of Fischerbach was funded by the total costs of 71 500 million.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently the farmers had to invest €12 million, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained angling.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and landscapes."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter White stand for Peter White: "here the best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state funding of fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of the presence of the LPR signed by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the untough area must not be inflamperated (slope of 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the collection.</seg>
<seg id="95">A total of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 km of fence at the beginning of the year 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The retention area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans will appreciate the same as every other - therefore the fatal fall of Saddam Hussein's place at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key Ideologist of the Trump-regimes, knew what he did when he had a symbolic e in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the suggestions of the president to drastic immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller took not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A Horde of Boafers and Liberty-Imitators had sought him when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their significance, and in particular the meaning that all of you had been attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his basis was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta recorded a complete thing about history, I don't want to enter a complete thing over history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to, which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct but how he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the raging words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your wedances, your poor, and your poor crowds to breathe yourself, and to breathe out free on your coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which" "" "apostasy" "" "was better to see our screens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly revealed that these people in Trumps are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who were willing to use their words to their death in the base - knew very good that they had finished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and american republics by giving it in a abused classic depiction depicting the female embodiment of the freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this significance: in her poem is the female figure no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And in itself there is a very different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the US native vism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people wanted to change from the right wing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010, that the Statue of Liberty was pointed, but rather a early neo-conservative, the American flame goes into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes out.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not to enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, limbergh left here to a bit.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus has existed in it to see how they had seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often horrible travels to the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense that the world from perspective of people to see the refuge and improve their chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective with Miller and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine forth the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power is ignited.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black loaders Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two scots belonged to the team of Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the Field Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member contingent of the world championship "becomes a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, starting on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "Scotland becomes something special" in Scotland, "and the athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue until we find out," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I say with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of the circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m trail while Eilidh Doyle was elected team-Captain by the team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is fairly modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their capitals "speech was incredible," says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh was completely innaturally, was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of Silver medal for the fifth World Championships on the 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">The best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle crosswise Muir leads on this path and in the last year five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It is going to be at the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m of runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, one after a great season, who was looking for victory in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships, when the only two bassoons in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Manners capitals says that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their countrymen did not only belong to the team, but in some cases also the medals and the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "the special thing to his team's surrender, is that they voted by the other members of the team, but to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me to make it something very special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all those that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes born to Podien.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is subject to chapters?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was good.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are again at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it's just like to be a great atmosphere there outside. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blockers from critics on Facebook: don't get a public ministry if you do not bear the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from the domestic policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He schimated in the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb we will be led like the sheep for battles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan who wants to work out more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil War Union was accused him therefore in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governor won the lawsuit as frivolutions, and the online commentary was full of a counterreaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when there is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in a stunning democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary measure.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primitive means to connect to his voters and decompose his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that will be officially designated and of employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argued that the reviews of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too simple to use the image of trolls or spears or hassaulted people running online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the actual people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And that only real people speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no role.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all told that their comments are respectful, proven and not professional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney at Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hassfully met, but she asked to hate Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented at polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction on Hasselt and another current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the news "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't think this idea too, if a number of people on the same topic, then they will be affected by some more than a so-called collective labor and not as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the governors as "concentrated spam attack," would others call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by removing a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you have done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect newspapers, and to burn newspapers, or remove demonstrators or to make it sweating.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's just what has just happened.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants that criticises that he has implied on Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County promised the First Amenment, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she was named a voters of its Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Before (R) received a visit from ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplier between 1776 and 1800, and an anonymous letter driver beat on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even at that time, Washington had an anonymous role.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people, the pseudonyms, such as "lawyer," Valerius, "" Belisarius, "and" Portius "wrote all letters of newspapers that made aware of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticised its position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the UK industry criticized his office, according to the historical documents, which were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps appointed new Chief of Staff to restrict the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the News media - in hope to hold the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, at his first working day with leading employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he would repented: poor information that come into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow information on paper - whether on paper or mailings - because the president would make better decisions, if he would obtain good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waiter's diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to imperforate paths by supervise his media device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps Relationship To TV reaches decades - and now where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when the cump was denied due to unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he had received a fair coverage of jobs," said the former elections team Sam Nunberg in February to politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the keys, Trumps Twitter habit is under control, according to six former electoral campaign leaders, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "was under control, is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaigns became something that we don't know other - that Trumps Tweets could not contain more combustible products without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably see something about the tweets that Trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had already made him a couple of times, trouble from him, then their efforts were worth the effort.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently alert it that Trump Controverses comes out.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem exists in the fact that people in a White House is composed of controversial parties, trying to present their own agenda using Trump Material, that may be promoting their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - deals with this story - in May about the preference of consultants, preference for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-government say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press parts, especially those with damaged Lecks, and that he should get out to figure out from whence they come.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This happened at the end of February when somebody issued a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused his deputy chief staff in Katie Walsh, "the source behind a cluster at his close to Lecks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he expressed false allegations in the past, and has contradicted them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to inquire over Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same one for three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager in Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still working on influence.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In Russia's affair by US president Donald Trump, he is said to have put a special Grand Jury named after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">On the last weeks the board have recorded work, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under his calling with the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper stated the step as a sign that Mueller widened its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN transmitter reported that there are already first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services accused the Kremlin to have systematically mixed himself in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were elections between trumps election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of investigations, several men are supposed to be involved in the election campaign as an advisor to the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special adviser Trump personally cast into the centre and seek out whether the President may not obstructed the justice in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys, this evidence is to examine and decide whether it is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictments.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when it concerns bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to the hearing of Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN transmitter, pre-invitations were issued to turn the Encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to a statement, was called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Moreover, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumps became adviser and in-law Jared Kushner and his damseless president Paul Manafort with the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts comments on Thursday evening on Thursday evening in US television that the idea that Mueller should not restrict his work, and that he should be necessary to do quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">It was not necessary to force that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the committee in the beginning of a new phase in investigations, and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the middle of the new revelation the president on Thursday night used an address in West Virginia to present the Russia-affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," said Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The topic give the Democrats a way to feel good to feel good because they can't have anything else about which they can talk. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a position he caught nothing from the suspension of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">However, these work usually also usually in secret, stressed he.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all activities that accelerated the work of the special statement on "fair" ways.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not be determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was the name of that explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">However Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">For this regime, the allegations against Trump became loud, he had to hinder the justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President is due to the investigation under large pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to representation of US media, the White House gathered a special tool against the special account and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Differently, as an independent special report of the congress as in the Watergate-affair around the later recen President Richard Nixon, Mueller appointed a position in which he theoretically could be fired from the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the Westantarctic, a gigantic iceberg has regained about 7 times the Berlins from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was the Zarhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Oceanic Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The weight of over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres large Koloss tact now to the north and become probably two, three years until it be melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice giant, researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people is not going out from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent of climate change has played a role in demolition of the ice, is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual coaches of iron pipes in the region around 30 years, the U.S. research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact ground.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be put together with global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">So far, the colossal colony was so far from the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swimmers on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Therefore, it is growing steadily to the sea and falls regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the north of this scarf, the balance of quake and breaks were interrupted some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis is divided in there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some reasons for the Larsen-C-Schelfeis in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice slab stand below voltage and could be broken down if a piece of a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelsis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the skelage causes that glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a low dimensions, the British research project is responsible for observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI-C-Schelfeis, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfeis of Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, on the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it crashes regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "even though there is no direct connection to climate change, the Eisschild takes now in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most broadest retreat since the start of Records," he confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will again grow again or back in the long term and possibly together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers have not lead the break down of this gigantic ice-iron, so many ice-petelves of Antarctic Peninsula have broken down in the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long dices of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British program British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of Antarctic Peninsula have declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula have warmed around three degrees and count towards the areas where the temperature is rapidly growing.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavendel in Provence is effectively endangered because plant in the past years was exposed to effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodosice will usually meet her plans for the coverage of the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through which organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unstoppable drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But in this day, in the shadow of her own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what safer feel: you should take their children with the office, who were the purpose of aggression with Granaten in 2009, or leave it at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrale, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask for reporter, names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal invents.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There is drug adugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the salaries of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest break from violence, and during all the country, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has left his office in December 2012, and there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, you can find the editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in the context of drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deep felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that shows his middle finger with the word "Justice" and hangs on the facade of the Riodoce-building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-Shirts, which show its smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, its nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">In 2010, a special appeal was constructed in order to process the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, who are related to drug trafficking and organisational crimes, the murderer's murderers are only rarely found in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">With Riodosice, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not good, although the terrain is yet more tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, meeting a discussion about the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to turn my time in this workshop," says he.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the why we awakes all of you."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the newspaper of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. it was forced out of his car and was shot down for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "12th Flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The scorer went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing worth silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans was arrested in the United States last year and the extradition in the United States in January was Sinaloa to become one of the bloody battles fields in the country, since rivalising fractions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It makes nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone can be shot or several people on the road, or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-story Mausoleen for drug may, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February, there was a publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the Rival factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have offended the sons, the gangmembers bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper kiosk.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in that Valdez does not force it, after the confiscation of another newspaper, who had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived such a long time to his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003 he worked as an experienced reporter for Norfolk, when he joined together with five colleagues in the founding of Riodosia and sold 50 US dollars to celebrate.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism," said Bojorquez, "said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the newspaper ministered a reputation to the courageous and honourable coverage, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard treble investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by one publication, in which they could read stories, who couldn't handle anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the formation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' for the Protection of Journalists on the Protection of Journalists in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where ever they led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"they must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done about how many dead... why did you not say what went on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team is missing Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curse the friend, which was generously with hugs and proposals, a teacher that knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there are always sitting at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they wonder: was his love towards the routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also been forced to question her own statements about it in question as they do their work on the best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to move with their women, their children, their foremost shops, their native line and landing runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-scenic and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be mocked... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodosice met for security training, there were suddenly no cell phone allowed. days before, yware that is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside the heat, two policemen sought refuge from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were contracted by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in shear, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who were the governor itself as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter went into the mountain landscape where the drug confounded the facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three principal stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a exposé to state spending, which concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the State bar, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about it, who was abducted or as it was done, so be careful when everyone in the city was white: that the restaurant is a favorite locally run by drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy which ruled the regaining Institutional Revolution Party (pri), which ruled almost all the century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several pri governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter, about predicting incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman went to a military fall.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers of Valdez had considered the best profound source about the abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "previously, we did know what happened," "" "Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El FLACO" "" "due to its slim body weight." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez Office was dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers that protested against the moral of journalists, because the employees had become something that they never had ever expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez lamented himself a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration of another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Noame disappeared for three days after Valdez has been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and told, based on DNA tests that it is its own.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In all the country, journalists became stronger, as they have written in organized protests, "SOS Press" on streets and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">At this day the Director Bojorquez was gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the fall of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez defended the authorities to expressing journalists and to bring them to the truth, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has asked since then to be divided by the government, because she worried that her rage has violated its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organizational crimes, involved in the government officials and a general society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism" wrote that reporter not only been killed by drug candidates, but also on the order of politicians and security forces involved with the organized crimes under a blanket.</seg>

<seg id="1898">Apparently, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1900">Their body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Chetas map: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and earphones were next to their abseparate head.</seg>

<seg id="1903">Others do on how it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartels with a guide on the front page with the heading "What do you want of us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the Georgian plant carnivores is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn radio when he died on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine at Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met on something that appeared from the ambient rock of the Platze, and decided to see more detail.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil used by it was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to cover the wild animal in the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) to cover heavy earth.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the ready result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you twist just a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it wasn't sleeping" "" "said the main autor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to go to the science history as one of the most beautiful and best dinosaurs dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this plant carnivores, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a walk-in shell, probably threatened by the carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The powerful Dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide themselves before smokers, and used a shielding technology that is known as countershading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have been allowed to mix well into its surroundings and to soften their enemies, say experts, which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature in the Nodosaurier family has been headlines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studies the wild animal, and it is called Borealopelta marker chelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible by Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of sheds and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the contemplation, a widespread defense method in the Tierreich, meaning that the tip of the creature was dark as its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shady shady is usual, the results are surprisingly surprisingly, since the size of Borealizta in far the size of the today living animals exceeds.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by the carnivorous dinosaurs, the evolution of the confrontation of the confrontation was favorable as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals who use the conshady - do you think of toe, Zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and violated as a prey, what is signalized that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong big-tier behaviour on a massive, strong sharpened dinosaurs showing how dangerous the dinosaurs crab animals of the chalk time have to have been" said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins reveals that the skin of the dinosauriers was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists will continue to examine the animal on critics above his life, including its preserved cornea in order to figure out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died out into a river and pushed into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland as they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it has completely covered with preserved skin, but also in three dimensions, and the original form of the animal is keeping," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal looks today almost as in the early retaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use your imagination to reconstruct it. if you are just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is in sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge thermal diodes, carnivorous dinosaur, which stood on two legs, the Earth went through.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealizta, the dinosaurs dinosaurs was chased by some of his fury ancestry.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta after the death in the sea broke and ratified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he died on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millenium Mine at Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the roasted dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armament, and is fully from the muzzle until hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures was on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips which ragged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the botanical plant carnivores was shinted by the western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater landing of the dinosriers keep his armament into this item detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The stone remains of this special specimen are so good enough that the skin treats still cover holge plates along the dinosauriers.</seg>

<seg id="2003">The "comfort Check-in" works as follows: you rises in the train, calls his ticket to "My Ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button on electronic alignment then appears out of the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train cable runs on their mobile devices a message that the gast X is located in the train and the booked seat is Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor for the ticket control in position Y, he knows that a passenger with already valuable online ticket is seated.</seg>
<seg id="2007">You can continue to sleep, further silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the clients, one for the train - what is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "if you want to travel without a ticket control by our train accompanying personnel, the DB navigates just itself." ""</seg>

<seg id="2011">Second plus: "our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those often travels, knows that next to delays and missed the ticket control will belong to the greatest doctors.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case one of the members do not have all the documents necessary to use online tickets for the recovery of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either lack of credit card or identity card or otherwise a document must be given.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the evenings or large space and delays in the control of your own tickets and seize the workers at the end of the time to concern other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Pet?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany was shattered by Brittany Ferrell until her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after they arrived in New York City, the St. Louis bones sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment, which they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed at its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the field of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18 year old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body that was stretched out on the road and stay there four hours.</seg>

<seg id="2031">There were photos of police band and people, cried, and out of a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>

<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt dtelfrost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return flight and went to the next day at home.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she repeated her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two next morning would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary movie, "Whose streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and the protest, the love and power loss, the strength and resistance, which consists of the point of human beings, who live in the community and filled the streets to claim answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As a heast with her daughter, wearing a flower-dress and a matching crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation, that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remembered not how I taught you when black people have to fight for that?" "" "they remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2046">"what happened to today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and pulled it up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have lucky to give you an experience, in which she has experienced no eklatin racism, it is not unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling I would have a bad service to keep it far away." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authorities that was invited to a camp as the activist on the possible non-accusation of the Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined to a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They made ready bags and hallowed them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new type of activism for ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nailment Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell arrived at the Sabaah-Folayan evening demonstration, one of the co-film directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar did not want to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question occurred Ferrell in the sense:" "" "you want to document or try to find a story which you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">These skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As folayan recently explained in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices were not centered and we wanted to make it different."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field that is known for his activism around Togeal occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought Ferrell the project, along with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Pet?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us. we speak," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented, so I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is "not a Messiah-leader, but around a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved the most obvious list of participants in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, the documents of "Whose Pet?" surprisingly personal aspects of ferut life as she loves and marries her husband.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain physical affinity at this work and of human people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">Moreover, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black swinged women in the wider Black Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which led to the film "BlacklivesMatter" in 2012, identifying the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identifying herself as Swul.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, pregnant women in managerial positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling with different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, pregnant women must wear the main load of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folklore voted to note that "movement really is held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not the active type of action," in the distance from the distance to their identity, as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"it was the person who recorded this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although she was in front of the front, because in a life of these crucifixtures as a black, schwule woman stands as much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel the energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared, but the rassy links between the community and the police continue to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Fermentation is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she still cled to a singing and she feels his memory ever since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love one another and assist.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalahn": TV readers will discuss about Bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built long.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian area splits the population in Beatrically and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly cannot be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" on Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While they say one to the Bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Nicole Becker) or "Das would be real-class" (Nicole Six), comes from the other side: "need no human being" (Siggi Bume) or quite simple: "size wahn!" (Lars firewood).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the fears rebuilding that a gallery offers more customers to the city, including those other shops, the opponents were afraid that the pedestrian shopping perished.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Moreover, the gallery is planned on the plot in which the farmers market hall is where 13 directors are sold.</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will be concluded with the start of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - in fact, on the Beda-Platz with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying a weekly in the farm market for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the country are getting very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to know that during and above all after the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there is also the same.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting ".</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketed in a Markthalle in the gallery appears on the height of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The project is likely to be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether Clothing, boots, droplomas or Supermarkets: I find the superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of which, there are enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is so important that at least the market hall remains at least.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all the goods offered are freshly offered, mostly directly from the producer, and is low priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop transactions in a shopping mall will be rented only from larger firms, because the rentals are often not able to be a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Pity, special shops are almost no longer and what remains of it, then will probably vanish. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where should the farmers market during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA the solution - even on duration, if the bit Gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or make it the ghost bit gallery already, all shops from Bitburg to drive out? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer market hall, it is because of the madly many - how I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg does not have space more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A proper similarity: artist creates the portraits of Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the friday of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost endless for cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuplights and hairdressing, which were sent to all of Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the cuttings from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analytics tried a 35-year sentence when she made a secret diplomatic report on the WikLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called a Becoming Resemblance (A proper similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into their specialized competence in technology, computer science and art, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama, having only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, like anyone with these genomic data could not only look at the formation of DNA data - the many ways you can interpret and the harder Determinism of these interpretations, but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, which was born as Bradley Edward, but since her doll had openly spoken about the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the Spionagesetz, computer was and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Due to the prison, its image was suppressed, so very that there was only one single photo - a grained, black-white Selfie, in which manring is clearly on a driver seat and a platinblonde bead is associated with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project'Stranger Visions. "</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it the artist portraits of strangers from forensic Artefacts like cigarette dummel and chewing gum, producing the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how this people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"you led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany these articles," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to do a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her prisoned Muse have been sentenced to unadultery over two years, which led several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even made a copy of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Supplies Images," which had a future to predict the exhibition, and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also the opening of the exhibition a little depth and Starkes, since Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths to allow the rigid permissions that he should actually solve, further flaming.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a copy of the gallery written by the galling called Manning with its oversized signature (the "i" in its family name is equipped with a heart) an end of the "automated ceremonies, whose foundation is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist) show how amazing, at least in biological respects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people are hopefully to take care of what we are, and how open genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are" "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious memories, also is to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a own room is one page from the above mentioned Comic-novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-free speech in the hands of the United States' discipline as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it predictive in the comic book - but if it should do it, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of the masks, from their own genomic simulation, which are united with hordes of Protestants.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted at that time, as all in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic trousers were written with a pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A spokesperson at the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail explanation that "we are willing to contact the police in Great Britain and willing to help US Investors on any conceivable way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement pronounced that warn colleagues were shocked and want to make himself.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he would ask the suspect to suspend the authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that was based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected.</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be more crazy about 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report about developing sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start to take up their ascent.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are fun with it, but the company supply every lot of it, and we will still be much more likely to see," said Mr. Sharing said in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed by their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone oil that feels warm - with deliberate human reactions to be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can customize his robots according to its beliefs "and choose everything, from the eye color of the robot about the form of chest pain to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will still be inquieter, as many robots have the "personalities" who would look at a stepford woman progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to Robots with a silicone oil.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example to customize their robot to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing as relentment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex robot with preprogrammed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which conveyed the impression of relentment and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality who has been adapted to your personality is as good as possible," heating the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you like that you like, and it doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has its tuning, just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be weary, fixed in conversation, or she can be "in Mood!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects with this promotion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships, but the subintentional character properties that goes on rape, if one go to Frigid (here: undisputed) Farmers, beatified one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website the True Companion Roxxxy is a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men have any Roxxxy?" it is called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fat or just a different sexist.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her birth and its growing refinement demonstrate to a little darker and deepening it in our culture, to an withdrawal from the ideal of equality between the genders to a desire after having sex with undergoing as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally hold no sex robots, and while FRR indicated its growing popularity, however, they remain unchanged at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leak out of the border zones can be leakage in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or belge, until them the free market gives the permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however, certain overcutting that these highly developed sex robots in a period of time occur in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there has been a president in the White House, who led to have attacked women's sexually attacking.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most severe aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid's') are not the graphic images that counterparts the body and the out eyes, but like realistic this vision.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it feels like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind those sex robot is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their genetic disorders would like to feel human being, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, at the point, when it comes to their personalities, the robot no real women constitute.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to understand the word of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It is become one of the revolution era of the Trump era that the political spans who have the US voters split up also families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around the Christmas and harvested festival there were newspapers in the USA with suggestions about how to have to circumvent the horror of the trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We exiting us all to supposedly on our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notice was the power of trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-directional dip that lives in Chicago since a long time with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity could have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone knows, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and very strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to find the dining table this is certainly a good cause, but it falls to me in another context that this also provides considerable risk.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the excellency effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the gracious possibility of getting us no longer a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a more frightful long-term scenario in which the Republican republicans of the right wing are normalized, "which at once compared to its standards suddenly appeared as intoxicity of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I found myself of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney uric version of the retracts - the dog on the car, which looked at least 14% income tax (but at least did we know how his tax returns) - both in comparison to trump in fact a very mild criminal offences occur.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify for themselves as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to the carousel at Central Park, the biggest of the carabells of the New York parking department, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not use caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass design on the central cylinder - all clowns are crushed and the animals turn to look back through their own shoulders - extremely dark and growing music conveys this on a notable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">As many Klischees disappointed a city: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are familiar to provide a great excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five and thirty years later, and I am still not yet left over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - the theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the North London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Carousel is still a strange magical experience, since there are two two-year old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">When I had to rate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately, nobody else has asked.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store in this week, my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars, before I was able to pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the corner of my road it is the same thing, plus the option to balance an average of 15% tip - this to purchase something about the cargo.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This doesn't result in a slowdown of what actually a neutral exchange should be, but exerts pressure on the server to enter Personality into a situation which is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman at the department store stood excrusting, while I tired the experience gained my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain in the hospital moved</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the past year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of incitten, to the hospital, which he suffered in prison, according to a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistol was sentenced to death against a first death sentence against murder of prosecuting attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's early morning in 2013 by sending them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on them.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius maintained that he hid his girlfriend for a night intruder who hid themselves in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to state this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell which they say they would be too dense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecution authority said that it would be lifted up against the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is running danger that his penalty will be increased to 15 years, if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases might be left.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the US, causes magnets and blueprints, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those interested party usually come to avoid meat and milk products, researchers found at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins work to develop immune cells which promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells were patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the body, not into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to remove inflammation, are balanced of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When equilibrium is dissolved in the direction of inflammation, it may cause a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, a type of tolerance submitting immune cell in mice occurs that carry a certain bacterium in their inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterias - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It proposed that the combination of L. slowteri and a tryptophan rich nutrition is tolerant, less anti-inflammatory botherus if the same system also promotes people with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral prizes in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan is looking for a kind of immune cell that had been found that a group of study enclosures had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but they had not been accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The hardness of mice became DNA sequenced and there were six bacterias found in mice and immune cells, but without them were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that a intestinal microbiom was missing and they did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria break the immune system into the immune system and then caused small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed among the tolerant conveys cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid was cleaned, it proved to be known as a by-product of tryptophan metabolic ism that is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells were halved by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have tolerant powers of tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect it from our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan products from L. slowteri found the cells in people like in mice but defects in gyptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the Darms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially, high tryptophanism in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to a expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report about the loss of the abuse of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report of the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continued on discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissener, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church," announced its publication against the German press agency, he earned the 93-year-old brother Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Notary Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very serving to the appearance of the Catholic Church when Mueller and Ratzinger would like to express its deepest regret using their own submissions, or at that time incorrect evaluation of the operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">On the other hand, the Vatican company "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that the coverage of violence in the domination of "two hundred measures" was measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the overterms in Regensburg no one nobody believes that it would have to be "dirty and damage" in future, but the author Lucetta Scariia, the author and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the accustomed to designate the Catholic church as a source of all evil experience is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion about that" "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Here also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go on the church, and this is a bound FY."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, they pointed out that in their adolescence, it had been a normal pedagogical agent, "to be done with naughty children, as I was one was ready to be done."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to use today's standards for earlier decades, because the world have changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse, also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Entirely to wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who was written with Ratzinger, wrote the "My brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Ezekiel," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report written by the diocese Regensburg at the reconnaissance team Ulrich Weber has presented himself?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In a total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows, between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plaid" victims of overtook, 67 Domspans sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "together, we hold that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with high emotivonality, the punishment for the pupils could even be even more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nonetheless, in contrast to many other people, however, many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. R., and therefore in numerous cases linked to him even positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Eemann, why the final report of the abuse scandal at the Regenske Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger closes his mind on his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report about the incidents of violence against protection agents at the Regenske Domsparrows, "there is a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For an raise many students his "humanity".</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the others it appears as Cholerias and perfectionist, which was designed by the Öfteren. if a domain kit was musically superior to top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use the Biograph this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must ask oneself more, why the name Georg Ratzinger is coming to it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Once eight sides are dedicated, and it is clear of every suspicion of the mediation or co-dying from the terrible suffering of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence excesses at the Preschool took place outside of its resphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may fall before him in the case of having experienced, or first quotations have not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domenatzist grammar school, on which he worked, was taken from practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">In this way, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger makes a very excellent record, "a very popular", "competent," and "understandful teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes, cookies and sweets, and" always surrounded by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is about its perfectionism and its high motivonality that led to wiping out even times.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he didn't only threw the chairs and the key and the key on the floor, but also earnest moved and too naughty guys to the hair or ears, he himself has deeply saddened and excuses.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, at its honortion it must be said that such correcting methods in the fragment period, the 1960s and 1970s, were common to parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such chatting methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of all of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also saw this in a worldly school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually is about this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violent taking on the preschool, the freilich Bagatellen were.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There you're asking if it was not more to do with his acquaintiness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media overthrew him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope, there are many who never understood him, still in frig.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report drafted Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a lot about misuse of abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen took place in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will be put into consideration either sexual abuse on sexual abuse during the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the cathedral-kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never seemed to speak to speak with my father or my mother," "" "he said," "" "I told me everything very embarrassing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was, but is that most victims of shame.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not familiar with parents and siblings, then definitely not a choral leader, he would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do I rate the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionably disciple formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he would have had been kept confidentially and would have occurred to the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, assume that something is urgent or clearly open, as compared to their parents, Internatsled, Confidence instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance, the interested students and / or their surrounding areas could not be confirmed as part of the examination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free from everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be tossed to him, unable to prevent him or have brought it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to bring his good name in conjunction with these contrasting crimes, as it was done in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, there was a lot of "Violexzesses" at the Regensburger Domatzen atzen station.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The earlier cathedral-kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be presented in the "Wegener."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the great problem that in the coverage of everything was missing and menhides to a giant melange of sexual abuse and violent seize and somewhere in the middle of the country, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is then clean: between the primary school and the Gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other charges.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report deals with the events of the period since 1945, also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the domination of domination.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrific test education, the cases, in which child of sadistic teachers were shatterned and were horrified, all of that occurred on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skillful states have to have occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got her only her face when they were already at the Domenatzist grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In which, as the very most witnesses came, the theme of "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paraean" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was at the Domspatzist grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but there was no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, at which the report comes to conclude that "many victims were estimating the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in numerous cases linked to him even more positive memories."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So no more the reproaches to have been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by states in the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he just began to establish and from the predecessors at a school where he didn't work and responsible (so the witness) would not hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Can Georg Ratzinger wear the ears along the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzist ymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this way, he indicates that in the preschool, he will continue to be practiced. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">Prior to the risk of negativity, it will already be urgent insistence.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was only banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey zone, just as everyone knows of us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate the fact that the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatic and where really the allowed limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">You can't say anything, he would have gone astroned.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the study was finally abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis is said to use it unfair, today to address pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the 'Fallstrick of Anachronism, "thus the danger, which is present to today's moral dimensional chain.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this is not true of course for sexual abuse, who was abovable to all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's sins, that goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very fearful and I'm glad that it is finally processed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to use Georg Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds to discipline and ravening, thus earring and shoulders and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment is then prohibited, it has also kept stripped away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his rainy days has Georg Ratzinger, for the talks with you for the book "My brother of Pope '?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of testing even to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as the Domsparrows played only one side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Yet, I didn't let any means that he led a stray shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But it has to be said once again: without these perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly possible to form a institution of world transplantations, true cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition, which went directly to the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">At biscuits and Bonets alone one of the rebellious boys only makes no big singer and before any success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-winding.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really learned to know Georg Ratzinger and always come back as a wonderful, humorous, gracious and heart of good people, of whom you can not imagine that he could not do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm getting regular, just as many former domain names still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and they will treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him today, that he once was strictly speaking to them, thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are today thankful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, väterous teachers - a stringent father, eat that may be - but also a love respectful Respect to which she still has today and honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">"" "and please, once again: all" "" "all things you have made him, are educated methods that were at the time of the agenda." ""</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because it is prominently and a more prominent brother to make a medial sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it is only obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves it on him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the call areas, a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps even Germany would probably have to know the Regensity of Lausanne, finally in peace.</seg>
