J@@ enni@@ fer An@@ ist@@ on : I &apos;m always attached in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
that did the Hollywood star in an interview un@@ am@@ big@@ uous .
&quot; I &apos;m always attached inside drawers or can get stuck from the outside label which have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the wish to be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ est@@ ly , these things are rather un@@ man@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it is explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
at the best way the act@@ ress brings up her time at home , front TV with gl@@ ucose and Mexican food , meaning it in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white wine , they bring the question after the request of children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not married or have children to be entirely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ ides
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er searched with some colleagues a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
after a few minutes , the horses remembered her ceremony , they pursued the rapid gal@@ lop of the feed home in the fast gal@@ lop .
a kilometer during the pace , I have dre@@ amed .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er .
and with that the riding career ends then again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left his family over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t touch them a photo .
it was the first time in Aachen , with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance presented the man from An@@ hausen in a small gala in the context of a small gala in the context of a small gala .
there won &apos;t be able to win the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Cross Society , Silver Square lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already sh@@ aded him .
a long winner is the 18th winner of the pyramid of pyr@@ am@@ ides .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades long he encour@@ ages the offspring .
and so he also won the prize money of 25.000 Euro .
with 15 other leading sports@@ men , the two @-@ fold U.S. Masters winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
for the featured athletes the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schm@@ itt , who Turner in Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , who owned by Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Lud@@ ov@@ ites Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously at hand @-@ held Erhard mar@@ lich .
many of these sports were taken on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part , the lively society emigrated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize ran .
Bernhard Lang@@ er kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ t and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in comparison : IT &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement T@@ TP - that &apos;s to both Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidate , however , are among the tax and energy policies as well as in a basic query .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental difference of more philosoph@@ ical difference .
the importance of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns , as the state of the economy harm - with taxes and taxes .
Clinton to put his death to death and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
but by contrast , he was very different , said tr@@ ump .
he will rep@@ aid ra@@ fts massi@@ vely , and he will take care of far tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to open , he has dis@@ advant@@ age@@ ous opportunities to open and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the we@@ al@@ thy would rise , says she .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
to invest in the le@@ ash , Tr@@ ump and Clinton &apos;s almost wor@@ t@@ ful .
the democratic applic@@ ants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes into the infrastructure include classical democratic politics and become rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ y wings of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
the internal discussions could be added to Tr@@ ump .
more significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and drive the coal extraction in the USA again .
oil extraction has also been possible to cancel the protected areas in the Paris@@ ian climate agreement .
Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies against their investment program and calls : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create million jobs . &quot;
&quot; it is probably either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only for infrastructure - even with international trade agreements the two competitors are not far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the G@@ azi@@ de trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign both .
at the same time , both w@@ anders would not is@@ olate the international trade , but only American jobs are better .
they then are supposed to be paid better , calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be down , then he says he shall not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably develop rather to develop the control policies of both camp .
on one side is Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him , so the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton wants to demand at least of the we@@ al@@ om that they would pay more taxes , and their critics saying : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee to almost everyday life .
when they come in Germany , they often are trau@@ matic .
a house provides refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ essed with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ red on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until it speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is part of the Con@@ dro@@ bs division , a carrier for social aid supplies in Bavaria , and among others , with the topic of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ ated accommodations for all wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment along with Pro Sagrada Familia and Munich &apos;s Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
un@@ long it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has done on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are polit@@ ically persecuted because torture or death thre@@ aten , or because their families didn &apos;t send them as a hope to everywhere in Europe , &quot; says she .
there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal secretly for the flight : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way . &quot;
in her hom@@ eland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a bottle of water is required for a bottle of water , is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end once they arrived in Germany , say B@@ ahr .
too , all women in refugee camps were often deemed to be considered under@@ min@@ ating and worse than mis@@ used .
this leads to the fact that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the Munich area are trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates .
&quot; some of the children were certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot;
many women were so familiar to say that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t look , open to speak of the earth , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often did not help to help , there will be more accommodations for them , requ@@ est@@ ing B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District judges are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich , in their authority area , answer some with no .
in the Upper Palat@@ inate and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in the governments of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben alone there are not only separated women , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle fran@@ ken is available in some common floors or private houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two key accommodations solely for women .
the European Parliament &apos;s rights and gender equality has also calls for women to be separated from men in the European Parliament .
in a study published by the Committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women can be separated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or women are accommodated together , it can lead to - persistent - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all the shower room should be separated and accessible for women , is in the study .
as much the women of this protection must be felt , one can read on the qu@@ ence that there is on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been talking about that we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could easily make a second house easy .
assist@@ ants strike : requirements after new working hours
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called upon their trade union to appro@@ ve new working measures in their dispute regarding a new treaty .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire council , starting September early September more working measures .
the J@@ DC said that it would have been given to the wor@@ ries to worry about the Treaty .
assistant and medical students have agreed on the agreement of a contract in July , agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained calm to problems , which resulted in the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In those of whom the J@@ DC board voted to complete the proposed new treaty and demands the official new negotiations for all your fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has set a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of cal@@ ming working measures that starts at the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes led out that Assist@@ enz@@ ym@@ es introduced this year six times , the first total out@@ comes in the history of N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A assist@@ ants Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the agreed contractual conditions stipulated by the BM@@ A .
he shared information for@@ warded by BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be instit@@ uted .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and claim an official end of the eight months of lasting war in the words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ acting in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot for@@ bid me that Ankara wants to reconc@@ ile these reconciliation .
there was a blow , yes .
but Put@@ ting the sm@@ iles worked nar@@ rower and radi@@ ated warmth , even for his return to the circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an , however , said repeatedly to his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to crisis , but can even improve themselves .
the next day a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an would have occurred as it would never happen something worse .
my enthusiasm appeared to me rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant and sustainable cooling demonstrated that the Russian government had forgotten nothing .
rather , the reason of the crisis was the first , what he mentioned in his execution : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ ron@@ eous .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen back in the back .
the move was even bigger as it was committed by a good friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es re@@ build again will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media held a violent , un@@ restricted attack against Ankara .
at once it seemed to bear all the gu@@ ilt for everything .
on the most difficult , the alleg@@ ations of senior officials conducted that Erd@@ og@@ an had benef@@ ited own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , who will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he was disp@@ uted of this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message said that it was time to look forward to the front .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President of Erd@@ og@@ an to the debt that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of an arm@@ ist@@ ice are clear at hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs all friends who can get started after spending last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his ministry .
terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economical designs .
Russian sanctions have taken their importance - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has dropped by nearly 90 % .
in Russia , travel agents and Charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights will be resum@@ ed .
they count on a late summer ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week forecast the State television inexpensive fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are imported again .
a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i formulated it like this : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is aston@@ ishing in the West , since there was a reaction to the question of power to put in a weak response .
to do this , the continued gro@@ roll through the snow @-@ stamp of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ p@@ pi@@ ke to pull out the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West .
Russian State government won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara with security that he asked for the attempted coup d &apos;@@ etat in favour of the chosen organs .
that is well @-@ known for Moscow a self @-@ intelli@@ gi@@ bility , which even has to change a deep breath in front of rain .
the summit in this glorious palace of the sea facilit@@ ated Russia and Turkey , a similar way to me as an analysis of analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of outside lateral &quot; states : two countries taking off the west and po@@ or@@ ly to feel bad@@ ly .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the largest difference is in Syria , where Moscow has recently been the role of peace times , but where Russia and Turkey support mutual connections .
it could be characteristic that after almost three hours of ch@@ anc@@ akes , both pre@@ sidents on the press conference said they did not get the topic once again .
the President of Turkey didn &apos;t expect to reply to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to acc@@ entu@@ ate this .
there is no clear con@@ sens@@ us about it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open host@@ ilities and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when the NATO member of Turkey qu@@ oss the Russian combat jet - surely it is certainly better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank of Staff of the Bank , R@@ BS bank is to have only been reduced to a backup office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
in Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan used the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amp@@ itions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself , when she was almost collap@@ sed eight years ago and had to be saved .
brand &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consumer brands in this time .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds for sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to move more national stamps in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock market to Nat@@ . change .
Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used to customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for private clients who will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ WAN was inter@@ viewed during a guided tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be at our investor brand as well as the brand , among which our employees will be employed , as we are now going to be a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank was a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now that we have no global targets , but track all local goals .
each of these stamps is completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working with the customer under these stamps .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be continued to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perc@@ ep@@ ability of various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , as we concentrate at the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been a very c@@ yn@@ ical three years ago , when we said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched this brand .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes .
we can bring these stamps once again , so I think that time has come .

Russian Putin breath@@ es Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin gave unexpected his staff to his staff , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the nar@@ row@@ est confi@@ denti@@ ality of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport issues .
in a statement by the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is said that Putin have ordered his duties for the dis@@ mission of his duties as chair of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ al@@ Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Ivan@@ ov@@ s &apos;s deputy , has been appointed to his successor since 2012 .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tallinn , in the Estonian capital , in Tallinn , he graduated at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin it is ( in Russian ) that he later was a journal manager and Deputy Head of the Government .
on his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support their activities as head of government and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked therefore to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
persu@@ ading the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has been mysteri@@ ously in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time of the nar@@ row@@ est confi@@ denti@@ sts Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
in Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , who had been broadcast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that Chief of Staff returned on his own request .
but despite the lungs for cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
is there thus a consequence of a kind of power ?
this is no one knows .
but the official claim - that a man who once appeared as a potential president to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov &quot; it &apos;s true that I have asked you to do this very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - you could have to mention this very much more than four years .
as it emerged , I have been chairman of the Russian pre@@ sidi@@ al@@ Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin became a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
he called his name to power Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he confi@@ ded in most .
once , Ivan@@ ov was assumed to be the second term of office in Russia , as a third term , putting Putin to the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , near@@ er ally putting Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later .

Que@@ ens@@ er Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land Cross@@ ing with Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - what does the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four verses of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is close to the construction of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete , and 46 slo@@ ped styles .
the project &apos;s £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
the building site K@@ eit@@ h Brown attended the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country to the bridge .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ er Cross@@ ing .
we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly ep@@ ic measurements with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the flow between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck has a hei@@ g@@ able activity which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge covered in their place and the last stretch of Dec@@ ks gets a bed base for the deck , meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted up on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure of the tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ proof and deep @-@ scale construction represents .
after the installation of the last street @-@ cut and its connection with the north @-@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap between the north or the land .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 mm in the south .
this was a massive and very mild activity .
massive , because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , approx . 6.000 tons and a gradient of about 3 % had to be moved up .
the tolerances , as the tolerances , which the team work , were tiny - on each side , it was just a few millimeters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still to be in life &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still to be alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI ambul@@ ance beat on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men were able to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we looked like the boat in their proximity to themselves and introduced us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its range , until we left to water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man got exhau@@ sted at the age of 60 and was found coll@@ ars without a li@@ fe@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the coastal path and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; LORD Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were cast into the water have no chance to be hurt , nor to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine had a stop@@ plug , however , however , dis@@ band@@ ed the boot of the bo@@ oting from the person who contributed the boat .

seriously wounded - a man gir@@ t on his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend
a man has attacked its ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously wounded .
as the police arrested yesterday , the 50 year old had the key to get to the apartment to get his personal information .
instead of the alcoholic k@@ icking , the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
when they came into the apartment , he st@@ ew@@ ed twice to them .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt in the hand and at the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 year @-@ old , the clothes of his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend destroyed his mother .
this al@@ armed acts his sister .
together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she couldn &apos;t move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her companions out of the house .
on the road they met the Ex living environment of the man .
when the two women met again the flat , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the site and took his ex @-@ gir@@ l@@ friend .
who builds Brown &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green my : investors should become much stronger into the duty in future .
how is it re@@ acts on the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD be@@ ats a &quot; hand @-@ concept living &quot; for the next rat@@ ch .
but dispute is programmed .
first line is about the question : who should actually build the favourable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
SPD faction Chairman Christoph Fr@@ mann writes : &quot; we are pleased with the Green Party : who wants to build on urban areas , in future , 20 percent of all flats have to prove more than social dwellings . &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be found in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big dispute in the Town Hall is , however , Fr@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how are you looking for investors to build private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as a social dwellings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing programme that will cost millions of costs and will be financed for incenti@@ ves .
the problem so Fr@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fr@@ actions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as a few rules .
the Lin@@ ke will continue to serve hardness levels for investors .
regardless of this , Fr@@ at@@ mann , ex@@ h@@ ort himself a dis@@ closure of the situation in the housing market .
when the concept concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear if we get the skilled workers .
but the program is not completely overhau@@ led : because the approximately 1260 new homes should be built .
what would you like to compare the loss of further 1300 advant@@ age@@ ous dwellings in the period to come out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the current ties out of the city .
Moreover , in addition , apartments would have to be thought back to the prize money back again .
this is possible in the western city .
to a blow , the problem would solve .
because in the western city , at the end of the year , at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : these are the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social dwellings in the West town again increased dra@@ stically , one remov@@ es itself from the goal of the so @-@ called passage .
there should not be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens should calculate that there is still movement in the discussion .
Group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; a vast majority must have the CDU with the ship . &quot;
indeed , I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that yet a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world has changed .
that teen@@ ager and child will no longer go outside , but rather do you prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens at screens , was in the last decade of many compl@@ ained .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is to get people from the sofa and you can get active at Pok@@ em@@ on Go .
at the beginning the screen was at the beginning on the TV , then on video games and most recently to smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I have helped me of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters , which first were created for video games in the 1990s ( later there were a animation series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenom@@ ena of populations hit the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
in other countries , the market launch in other countries has been moved to the server which over@@ loaded the server .
within few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon uses more users as a Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go with their smartphones outside , looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who are pursued with a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
one generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the track and j@@ ump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that return the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , the 35,000 user followed , the Washington Post ordered that within two days following the market launch of the game , the number of people who followed every day 30 minutes , j@@ ump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for auction .
many public awareness campaigns to take about 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; every day to be active &quot; shooting down in ears , because many public messages are bor@@ ing in health and people come , look like .
nevertheless , the significance of sport can not be assessed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to attack cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to perform them here .
but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people are doing something in the open , making it fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered , movement , fresh air and sun@@ shine as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt for even new friends .
like always there are m@@ ür@@ ric destro@@ yers which always have to compl@@ ain about anything .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it mean ?
it is a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps have already been able to follow our activity earlier than Fit@@ bit , they gave us no reason to play sports such as this game .
the new will lose his appeal and use the use of the time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons , there will be more games that will un@@ ite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunting , more active , em@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ ly creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ian
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ ly is on all this immune system .
dynamic on the trampoline .
effortlessly on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on all the line .
and now Olympic champion now .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to campaign titles and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; Team d@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the rus@@ sian bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans , Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ bul@@ ent on the floating number of women in the art tournament during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ ly is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a campaign prize and overall ranking out the fifth , while she is their reputation to be the best of their generation , or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey took place at that moment .
this success shows the same league as a unique athl@@ ete like Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps , who brought their sports on new heights :
Bil@@ ly dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world masters - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals and precision , that the Olympic champion in 1984 Mary L@@ ou Ret@@ ton said that she has ever seen the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be an last examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ ly and the rest of the athletes , but rather , between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered as a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ ace , after they have won gold and silver at the gymn@@ asts of women at the gymn@@ asts of the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ ly won the first medal at Tuesday , while at the far@@ ewell party of the retirement team &apos;s retirement team , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ ly insi@@ sted on the top during their long way to have the future , the future is not really true .
a part of its ground exercises - that included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music , which would suit at home on the street out of the Olympic arena in Rio .
that is not a co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child , and by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother was discovered during a school trip to the gymn@@ asium in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained .
she has lost no surplus competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak , that will hold as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly through two turns , the picture divi@@ des the picture .
sulph@@ ur@@ bal@@ es and soil particles - in which Bil@@ ly holds the world title - were lau@@ ched .
she was repeated with 15,@@ 433 onto the floating @-@ bar again - and he sat on the ground with 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished her when she anticipated her end of sight - and tears on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue se@@ p@@ ens when the vision they described once in her collecting book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ geance for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ als , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; was a lead .
after her back@@ ward , she threw the audience to the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ ua , being over@@ thrown by a com@@ eback , that appeared sometimes .
what it affects , so the 19 @-@ year @-@ old native of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims shot at the car at the car at the car
according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in the first serious attacks by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a way , the authorities say .
the perpet@@ rators @-@ fired eight bul@@ ls from a hand weapon , while on the front side of the car , and fled with another car , is read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder did not have the result of a smo@@ ker over all , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who owned one of the adult victims .
at Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard MEP , Jonathan Howard told the shooting of the shooting , a closer look to whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks by seven people and two injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , in the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that attacks are associated and committed by the same rob@@ bers .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
lin@@ ers , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which equ@@ ated on an empty Pick@@ up Truck a half hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the series .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ancements and secured a ball out of the seat and ball @-@ in fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ zep@@ pelin : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and natural mother .
but like the least of his aging , Edmund Micro@@ zep@@ ae , the result of a genetic disorders , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during their pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought I did not create it .
I do not create it .
I did not let me go .
what is not true -- of course , one has left it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband has been informed that Edmund cannot recognize them under conditions , and that he may not survive .
some doctors had even been so far that they proposed that they would be institu@@ tional@@ ized him .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still make , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund cannot walk with the help of a walking tour .
Edmund could neither sit nor cro@@ oked until his third year , nor yet he cannot speak .
but he is making slow progress .
it can run by support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the character language that Edmund prepared for &quot; Please sing something &quot; before me . &quot;
&quot; we bring it the character language to &apos; , saying Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is no typical character language -- says she . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Mikro@@ em@@ hal@@ ie has a variety of causes : genetic such as Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it is influence the life of the virus infected with the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a certain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t know yet .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time more after the progn@@ osis , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with native damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it is better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rain emer@@ gen@@ cies , in@@ undation gives an occasion to the b@@ ail@@ ings in Louis@@ iana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
severe ra@@ iny and large floo@@ ding in Louis@@ iana forced the Govern@@ or to call the emergency call on Friday . it will be equivalent to the entire Saturday over with more ra@@ iny days .
numerous rivers in south @-@ east Louis@@ ian@@ as and south of Miss@@ issi@@ pp@@ is floo@@ ded its sho@@ res and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ iny , the National weather service reported .
the Govern@@ or of Louis@@ iana John Bel Edwards told that state officials remain in contact with the local authorities and have already been on the way to the communities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the governor , shared with that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags more multilingual .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts of the south Louis@@ ian@@ as until Saturday .
the weather service leaves that extra 3 to 5 inches might drop to rain in this area .
on Friday , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while mobile continues in the Mobile area .
the River Com@@ es near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite in the vicinity of D@@ enh@@ am Springs , which are both in Louis@@ iana , are likely to reach a record level of occurr@@ ence over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could floo@@ ded many houses in the subur@@ b of the near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream flood was a danger on A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish , because these rivers only be slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river ticket , south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , border line in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest level on Friday at 9@@ am .
rescue dog always wanted people from the flood of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the South@@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Le@@ Roy H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were found among those who were saved close to Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that Water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , which is difficult to rise overnight .
he said that another boots , who lives in the vicinity , had been war@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are w@@ alled , and the water flow@@ ed and flow@@ ed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it got my wa@@ ist .
his wife said H@@ ans@@ ford that she lived in the 48 years where she lived there , never seen such a high rise of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford told that he and his family members had all the disabilities , and it would be the only one that swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated till Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; had slow@@ ed down quickly , &quot; since there were heavy rain emer@@ gen@@ cies , and that the authorities evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer moving close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was significantly un@@ balanced since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainfall and road floo@@ ded the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching failure in five districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary ES@@ L reported that an or@@ derly houses were floo@@ ded in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were floo@@ ded both .
the leader of the commune of Rob@@ by Miller said that authorities were 72 people and seven animals were saved by the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , they were set up emergency shel@@ ters to lodge the evacu@@ ate .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will be back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the village of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa were closed almost two dozens of streets due to the flood , which hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ scape on the town council .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the manager manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count@@ ys reported that it rained on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses should be registered on Thursday than floo@@ ded , but they have no reported on Friday until now .
K@@ eit@@ h Town@@ son , manager in shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still appears . &quot;
Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot into Philadelphia this week , this week is the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown was able to abst@@ ain several occasions , including in the l@@ end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was a hospital at his transport in hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has made a lot and his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he distributed his grand@@ mother Del@@ or Mel@@ en@@ dez to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the condition of the boy was classified as a critical hospital , and it had to under@@ go several operations .
the family of the boys shared the transmitter that he is expected to grow again .
he report@@ edly had the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot at German town in German@@ town .
three males : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable condition .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is found in a critical condition , reported on the transmitter .
the other two victims didn &apos;t find themselves in the car and the police have just been determined if you could find themselves under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators used C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have occurred to a cross between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ eller for assault ri@@ fl@@ es that were trac@@ ed back to several assault ri@@ cks , transferred the crime .
it seems that there clearly can be tra@@ ded by an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk , envelop@@ es were found .
so it seems to have several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; shared police p@@ mann Anthony G@@ in@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were met in the area .
no statements and the police were checked , the surveillance video is checked .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a trans@@ verse sl@@ ack@@ et when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of the West Palm Lane .
they re@@ covers and the police is looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present myself among the women &apos;s trial in the Tower and that out of more than one reason .
first of all , I &apos;ve been in the summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. were never so dominant .
and second : this team has three turbo@@ fans , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ ter@@ ine and Madison Ko@@ cian , which is cath@@ olic , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has the black and His@@ pan@@ ic female presence at the top of this kind of sport .
over the past four years , the number one was named A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans in the last four years .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas became a surprising Olympic champion and the Americas .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion , Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be as she was unexpected , but most amazing gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual surplus event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but so turn@@ around classes did not see in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it to the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympics is only four gymn@@ ast inside the team . Moreover , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but reality sees so that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and Turner first line in private g@@ un@@ ite , which will be maintained by parents , set out for the training , installation , travel goods , competition , and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) .

assist@@ ants want to organize more strikes , after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers submitted the dispute over the changes due to acceptance of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants that descended at an election .
in July , Hunt plans revealed plans to introduce to the contract and said that N@@ HS could be addressed in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and every additional delay for employees and patients were dam@@ aging .
the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend , to improve maintenance to un@@ stable times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance to the last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have decided to heat to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat the current voucher crisis and so@@ aming it to treat all doctors . &quot;
at only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors had to fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by BM@@ A to the solution of disp@@ utes ar@@ ising from discussions with the government on resistance &apos;s sake and sometimes at atmospheric silence .
that was done by a promise that Jeremy was last month in the last month , that his door would always open .
&quot; Jeremy Hunt has to act now to raise the force and wor@@ ries the wor@@ ries of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he doesn &apos;t do this , so the assist@@ ants have clearly done that they are ready to perform further working measures .
the last strike in late April saw a boost of almost 13,000 rout@@ ines and 100,000 appointment before , because diseases in n@@ urses and specialists were included in order to grant physi@@ cians to cover stri@@ kers cover .
the ministers submitted the dispute over the amendments to the re@@ formed contract with the function of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ ning , General Director of N@@ HS , called for the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
Mor@@ ning said : &quot; labour structural measures can achieve nothing but a little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare their families , care and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the past two months , we spoke to me the state @-@ of @-@ the W@@ hist@@ ori@@ cians as well as other ministers with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries .
the employ@@ ers trusted that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training sessions , training courses , mutual recognition , training schedule , training courses , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in compliance with the BM@@ A agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medication can lower the heart of heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 per day medicine , after the authorities recommended to say this more people for a longer period .
the anti @-@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of recur@@ rent heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack which reduces the risk of stroke , or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of which suffer from a heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting gre@@ asy material in the ar@@ tery volumes , the cover@@ ings form .
if the flooring occurs , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that cle@@ ft the blood flow up to the heart and caused a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots trig@@ gers , it can flow through the blood flow and blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Br@@ ili@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the application design of N@@ ICE , which today has been released , recommends a 12 @-@ month @-@ taking of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily dosage of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Psychology , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack , have suffered further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative impacts on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively increases other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options of thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood @-@ risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the approach is advis@@ able to run over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness accepts to bl@@ ossom in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was granted last year on the occasion of a government report for corruption in office
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led , so far more widespread election in Muslim congregations will be igno@@ red as a devastating government report today .
the former office of Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es ri@@ ot the police , elec@@ toral committees and Rath@@ en@@ esses to have igno@@ red evidence of poll@@ utes regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ ic@@ ism , which is now a Ant@@ corrupt name , said that the holes should be permitted by voters from religious moti@@ ves so bad that the police should be permitted , shut @-@ off from out of elec@@ toral cables to protect an@@ gled voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a compensation to prove their identity in the elections .
at present a voters must call only his name and address .
the report suggests to carry out the ink on the finger of a person when they vote for the vote to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , Sir Eric .
it calls for the press to have more access to the documents and decisions of not official agreements or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against election , but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial instruments that eman@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Dow@@ ning Street as a consequence of the Tower Ham@@ lets in the East of London .
last year , a special optional court decided that the reig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man after a Lit@@ an@@ ei of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Tribunal found that Rah@@ man had corrup@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on z@@ yn@@ ical way , &quot; and that he had brought his critics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ op@@ ho@@ en@@ rol@@ la@@ ths to silence .
Rah@@ man &quot; said &quot; his campaign based on the basis that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ ective duty of Muslims to elect him &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either des@@ per@@ ate or the result of a follow @-@ up where one person cho@@ oses a person .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fr@@ aud in the whole country .
in particular , especially al@@ ar@@ ming to the fr@@ au@@ dul@@ ent letter - at the older members of the Muslim community , had made people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the leaders of evidence , to prove the identity
in his report , it is said : &quot; as proof , pressure on protection of some ethnic min@@ orities have been exercised , especially women and young people to vote in particular according to the will of the El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or ban@@ ish background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behavior towards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polit@@ ically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consider@@ ations regarding the eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion had igno@@ red &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition to process political activists , to stop &quot; election harvest . &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May in Er@@ otic , requires even tough@@ er registration inspec@@ tions to prevent the elec@@ toral directory for immig@@ ration and social clubs .
tigh@@ ten options in spl@@ end@@ our , voters before the election after your identification .
not leng@@ able ink on the finger of a person as soon as they left their voice to prevent someone sel@@ ects twice .
systematic consider@@ ations on the nationality of a person concerned to make sure they are entitled .
a three @-@ year limitation on mot@@ ions on an automatic postal code .
ban , political activists make complete correspondence and envelop@@ es on correspondence .
the police give the fug@@ ation , shut @-@ off for voting stations .
a Legislative Decree that facilit@@ ates an indictment due to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( the People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in voting stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ toral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the workout to make sure the employees rule the rule alone to go to the poll@@ s cabin alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there was no pen@@ sions after the Tower Ham@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the election tribunal has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for due to a Lit@@ an@@ ei of corrupt and illegal practices on unt@@ au@@ sible , &quot; he said .
based on a number of reasons for suffici@@ ently - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ checks &quot; of the elec@@ toral departments of the Town H@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the verdict in Tower Ham@@ lets in the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our land bears as the mother of the par@@ liam@@ ents as a proud heir , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and covered the spread of constitu@@ ents and le@@ ug@@ ging of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympi@@ an athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are the week over the French cycling athl@@ ete Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except border and band , which has proven itself as an impressive double @-@ winner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is far not the only one to show gold in the Ath@@ en@@ ians who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you may receive social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , that at present on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympic games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with the Hollywood celeb@@ r@@ ities .
the h@@ unters and the Wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the bicycle race , many people see on the internet as a certain arch@@ ery from the Di@@ d@@ ym@@ us of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ vor@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a tower on Twitter , after showing images on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in secret .
in fact , the arch@@ ery got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave him to hear that he looks like Leo for his childhood .
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , except the visual hair@@ y , &quot; was given Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a str@@ apping guy , so I hate it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will doubt show this year without doubt : the feeling simil@@ arity between the British U@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should go through Est@@ ef@@ an as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gloria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared to the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athlet@@ ic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption &quot;
another lasting comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ el who has much heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian Silver med@@ alli@@ sts in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova found more than just the sun@@ ba@@ ited skin and bl@@ on@@ ous hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ al@@ yn@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian joined fans , a &quot; athlet@@ ic version by Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about that others have dropped the simil@@ ar@@ ities to others
the theory placed in the room : according to this user , there are perhaps a reason to the simil@@ arity of the Pa@@ ares .
a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in declared that &quot; the rest of the internet commemor@@ ates that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter is almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar fac@@ ial and eyes .
other popular Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own wonderful , wide sm@@ iles , which resem@@ bles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ es twe@@ aked , &quot; Has the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 year old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pi@@ g died ? ? ? ?
the I@@ di@@ ot did not forget that it was still on show . &quot;
Ai Y@@ an@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Freestyle par@@ aff@@ in for women : &quot; this small 14 year old China has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cr@@ iti@@ que against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , where he asked him many for the speech
Twitter users stopped not back when they heard how uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter version Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you only work for the C@@ BC and Canada and makes it all look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # requested .
short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC programme , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast@@ ed over a bu@@ oy@@ ancy performance . &quot;
it was a un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , it &apos;s sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC susp@@ end more than 90 times in the people who answered the Not@@ ice on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze Mac@@ Donald in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC cop@@ ates his debt with more than 90 other Twitter users , who had a value of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments on the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network fail@@ ing itself quickly and gave a communication .
we regre@@ t it really that these statements have been made and that it was possible to watch them .
on night , we have def@@ ended yesterday at our audience on the con@@ sign@@ ment and our followers in the social media .
in order to clear one , Byr@@ ons comments on the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron does that which he said , very sorry .
in the morning , Mac@@ Donald &apos;s ap@@ ologi@@ st@@ owed to just@@ ify his statement by saying that it was not his intention , that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the commentary which I made after the woman &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have moved to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to them as a person . &quot;
of course there was no cont@@ emp@@ t , and I &apos;m sorry for me . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ tied over woman who tast@@ ed in the middle of the business
the buyer did not know where they should see when a woman went away their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mar@@ row to try subjects .
to wor@@ ms the situation , they numbered how they looked at it , moved them back and put them back into shelf .
they pursued and tast@@ ed four pairs of underwater in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tested the under@@ p@@ ants before they put back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny David@@ son , who had been at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ ed the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back to and buy the business without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
standing in the middle of the retail space , she recorded a pair of sub @-@ p@@ ants from the delivery , attracted its own stran@@ ds and p@@ ants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t even find a discre@@ et place to do it - she was just as Oskar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red , when she went out again , who did not like it , since she put it again on shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further sub@@ mer@@ cies , before it finally decided that you liked nothing , and went back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they seemed not to mind that they observed one - or concerning the person who would buy the sub@@ jection under conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as to consider that someone would take sub@@ mer@@ ciful to his house , who had an other person who had not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. David@@ son said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to move the garments from the sale after she went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go with a new pair of star@@ ters to go home and find out that another woman had assumed them and went not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9th of August in our branch in Folk@@ stone .
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect with tie Mag@@ a against weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a little saf@@ er for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to hike with armed rob@@ bers on distance .
regardless of whether you turn closer to the front or from the rear , this video will show you how to turn the sp@@ ear for your th@@ iev@@ es .
when you att@@ aching to you from behind , you should see when you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi &quot; from the line .
then take the weapon between your front and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with the kne@@ e to the breasts and turn the weapon from pain together , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run in the face and move back@@ ward while they set the weapon to him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers coming from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ ack@@ ers on the breasts , then turn the weapon from his handle before moving forward and the weapon to him .
sounds easy ?
watch the video to see how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a prey on the saf@@ est thing to ski@@ p your money - if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travelling Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide of his tongue at the dirty locations of Europe
a British journey sub@@ contrac@@ ted his immune system and dig@@ ro@@ oted a serious testing by taking some of the most dirty and tough@@ est locations in Europe .
the pres@@ enter and aut@@ aut@@ or Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will shut up his course on a euro coin , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ushing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before extrac@@ ting every object , he used an L@@ umin@@ ometer to show and show us what he is going to be .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising result in daylight .
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing pot of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely de@@ cent , but in fact there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health .
lu@@ ck@@ ily nothing left what he ab@@ le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intest@@ inal by taking through the world , as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations up to mol@@ ds of toilets , the task exhibited his immune system definitely under one sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ wor@@ ried about what my health was concerned and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and sl@@ ud@@ ge . &quot;
in the film he was devoted to his call .
the only thing that he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ eg@@ ist@@ rations showed a lumin@@ aire number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ance number of fresh@@ ly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refused after its lumin@@ ary number above 4000 units , whereas fresh@@ ly washed hands have a weight of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial counts of several sites like the bathroom
in the film he says : &quot; this is the worst thing that I have called in a toilet , close to . &quot;
there is no dirt than that !
I don &apos;t hear anything here , because it is inside the inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producers of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company offers Mr. Wright with vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system .
validation senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating to look at the same time , explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings through which we were saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intest@@ inal health is to a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how they are associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me lose my respect for Ian , if he would have tast@@ ed some of things I have instructed to him , like the ec@@ lip@@ tic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there was things where it was easier to bring Ian , to make them gro@@ ove , and others where this was quite hard .
I &apos;m glad that we have recorded some of these dirty be@@ ech trees on film . &quot;
in one of the survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all surveyed reb@@ ate bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal bacteria and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that added l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a con@@ ical family left its social apartment according to a del@@ og@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because they had terror@@ ized their neigh@@ bors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cked persons in the housing cooperative had property in a ir@@ reversible state .
the walls of w@@ aff@@ ed holes on , wooden tokens were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti by walls .
the family have been moved and it is believed that she lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she is not afraid that the apartment is no longer repair .
she said , &quot; There was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t need to live in this way .
there are many things to take into account since this property is probably considered to be a nice part of Corn@@ ish .
the family is not@@ ori@@ ous and their reputation is it also .
the pair had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police told that the terror that had added the family , street m@@ ons with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug tra@@ ff@@ icking , drug tra@@ bec@@ ues and flu@@ ence included .
Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was placed on the rental agreement , received an order for ant@@ is@@ o@@ lic@@ es in June .

Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged them and their partners for@@ ci@@ ble this week . after having extended an extended period of 11 weeks , she gave them voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neigh@@ bors who said that her life was made for hell .
one said : &quot; they refused to be ashamed . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not all .
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .

it was a very difficult fall since the behaviour was extremely difficult and to view their deeds for their neigh@@ bors .
I guess about the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community , who have cour@@ age@@ ous to us and have given us the information we have made .
I hope that this development will pose a few neigh@@ bors and gives the message that ant@@ is@@ o@@ economic behavior is not toler@@ ated .

I would say that we really have music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a bit older .
she reminds himself with mid@@ wives with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
fir@@ stly , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then , there would be Mari@@ as personality .
she said in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and White and B@@ right . &quot;
so , she is smart , naturally also n@@ ai@@ v , and passionate .

one sees it in any of his mot@@ ions , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a che@@ er@@ ful approach to life , that &apos;s very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece goes to advantages and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have gone back to New York , the Pu@@ ertor@@ ik@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want to escape .

Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality anticip@@ ates mass of mass
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and commen@@ ds the Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caffeine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Presidency of the Gü@@ len &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialog and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term of Germany , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany anticip@@ ates a tens of thousands of protection from Turkey to Germany .
medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , believes the President of the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard incident of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an after the attempted p@@ utsch , the Kur@@ dish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium term , with some hundred thousand pat@@ rons from Turkey , when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ orities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regime and the democratic opposition continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; World &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had passed over months of Kur@@ dish with pen@@ sions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds are within Turkey on the run .
still se@@ cul@@ ari@@ i and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added after the failed coup .
many are going to rest@@ art in Europe when they continue to op@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be a state that assi@@ sts refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff was accused of demonstr@@ ating Syrian Arab Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ alian cities .
in order to increase pe@@ og@@ an on the left @-@ up pressure on the remaining cur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been cut off or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff demanded that the federal government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunting &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ critic is also held in Germany .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and Opp@@ os@@ ition@@ elle .
the Brand@@ mark@@ er as a Gü@@ len pendant destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and Erd@@ og@@ an , sits on packed caffeine , by the way also the ma@@ ize and se@@ cular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; World &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the paper reported on appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Commerce , the Turks had already recognized the largest group of asylum @-@ related asylum in Germany before the coup d &quot; coup .
as at June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all than that are authorized to have been recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .

Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; gone where to do , &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the nati@@ ves get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the S@@ iner Parliament approved the beginning of the year .
for stup@@ id as far it is not doing so far : summer holidays , heat and land@@ lor@@ ds - that &apos;s not .
the loc@@ als that are convinced by the election fighters are on holiday .
the most beautiful tourists who are in the countryside are on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no loc@@ als , so may not choose the country &apos;s day .
this includes practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that hang up the posters , fl@@ ashing the air@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and count towards the end of the vote , only lab@@ our@@ ing .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again have to vote for just on the people over the day .
the hot stage , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also possible to do some : Prime Minister , Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly wonder@@ ing behind the CDU .
exciting as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign .
he travels across the country , spread Ros@@ en and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , as it had already been his legendary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff &apos;s legendary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , soul f@@ ake got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the bl@@ ame at the bl@@ ossom of the Af@@ D .
their refugee policy , her &quot; We are able to raise the rise of the sp@@ ic@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him now the beautiful office .
the CDU with her head office , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced , as it is , if you f@@ ights at the right place in the right place .
she has invited twice German Chancellor Angela Merkel to grand@@ parents ; Merkel &apos;s federal state is located in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not exist , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR , recently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also ade anyone to hear anyone from other corners of Germany , Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU agree on market conditions on market conditions and shopping centers with paras@@ ols and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
this , so co@@ co@@ ke , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also has noticed that , on the country the basis has led the base , that it must be very exhau@@ st@@ ately to find a wire to the people .
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the wake of the country hardly available .
however , the Council of the CDU election cont@@ actor on his fel@@ ong is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go where to do , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
because lots of game is , Sell@@ ering its SPD has now called for a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in poll@@ s the S &amp; D post@@ ings were at 22 percent behind Partner CDU ( 25 ) and just just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 the SPD was yet again won with 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small party with seven per cent in the surveys , could make the jump into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e out of the holiday emergency , and spread their sel@@ fre@@ iter@@ ation in the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online elec@@ toral campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the state presi@@ ding Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ toral dam@@ pers rely on track and searching for domestic ab@@ ov@@ ens among the holidays .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top le@@ gen@@ ic dat@@ at@@ in , cur@@ vy straight with a house boat due to the Mecklenburg @-@ Mecklenburg Lake and it is still beautiful .
her impression : &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : host workshops suffer from blocking
at the speed of speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated , there is nothing to m@@ ist .
for the persons responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 20 o &apos;clock there is no praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all have quite delicate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no default .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south on the weekend , until the end of October it is expected to be completed .
the contrary is also the opposite of the construction works , for example , if it goes to the facility of housing drives .
since the construction site taken on Monday to the South , and even the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was abolished and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg was relaxed , the traffic situation inside the place has rela@@ xes .
the citizens can now leave O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
transport to return through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there are partially significant complaints , &quot; says the general manager of the refurb@@ ishment of the refurb@@ ishment of the general manager of Florian King .
the local residents of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many s@@ ligh@@ ters sought and rather to their Nav@@ i confi@@ ded as the sign@@ age .
what led to that lack of truck was engaged in residential areas .
because the speed lim@@ iting cannot be stopped , the municipality strengthened the measuring car from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant sur@@ ges , &quot; says King , who made itself well over the location .
two to three per minute saw have been inj@@ ected .
the quick@@ est point was on the pace of 77 km / h at a speed of 77 km .
but since the construction site has moved , it has become a quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men do not hesitate to look in the cards .
but that the B 27 could be rehabil@@ it@@ ated with them into revenue breaks , everyone who asks you to look through .
however some more and some less are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end clients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( e.g. for other companies ) has hardly been produced for the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sul@@ z is also talking about a &quot; no less decline , &quot; but also a result of course , &quot; that of course , &quot; the lear@@ ner is missing . &quot;
the most powerful are the local spots along the streets .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
that is already existing threat@@ ening .
not only him , but all hosts I met it &quot; hard . &quot;
they lack@@ ed the clients from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ ins .
we are delighted to be glad over each Euro turnover .
the turnover income rose to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street creation have thrown his operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have dismissed the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy could have been re@@ acted differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt on an enqu@@ iry of G@@ öh@@ ner could give it a financial compensation otherwise by the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages to bear the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where something generous has been handled .
during all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
so that other guests can now know less frequently due to the complicated traffic govern@@ ance .
if you do not drive , it is also what beautiful .
in the end of the rehabilitation work , G@@ öh@@ ner does not return any doub@@ ts after the end of the rehabilitation work .
in spite of cr@@ ises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its cli@@ ent@@ ele for the largest crisis that has experienced its food site in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction , this is already brutal .
in the name of the terror attack on laws , laws shall be screw@@ ed .
according to recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now providing a th@@ icker safety package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
all his proposals are polit@@ ically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of its new security package .
they are calling for nobody .
others , other additional points would be deb@@ ated within the parties .
I also participated in that .
but the Minister of Interior was to him on the outcome , and at a re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sens@@ us &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach has stopped a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the republic .
but they now fall around so extensive .
some has already been announced , announced that a new security authority may take care of the neck @-@ encrypted communication , is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to translate several EU directives on air@@ crafts and arms legislation .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies will not be sur@@ pris@@ ingly .
in Part 2 , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals to do so far with the SPD : he wants to make sympath@@ et@@ ting for terror@@ ists and jihadists having double citizenship in the German passport .
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; in the CDU of the CDU . &quot;
nevertheless , it is still enough for reasonable and challenging what has no chances for the Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ist partners .
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
some of them are in part : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is planning rapid procedures for deportation and more possibilities for placing people before the deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees that have been targeted in the country are expected to check their smart phones and create social media players for a security check test .
for certain asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some worse than until now - about such that caused criminal off@@ ences or to cast their papers in order to swal@@ low their identity .
a lot of it is polit@@ ically and legally independent .
even still un@@ balanced and can be un@@ balanced .
and in some point - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ser , for example - the question arises : what does it actually do with safety and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it &apos;s important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be found in off@@ setting that the terrorist attacks in Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people had wor@@ ried about safety in view of the high refugees .
and things that make people deep , let themselves do not leave the chambers in election times .
the internal safety is enormous in the focus .
the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ lock is great .
and yes , there are elections .
Union and SPD increasingly keep internal security on the topic of internal security .
in the past days , it went up between the two parties .
only a gar@@ st@@ al dispute concerning the facilities of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of several Unions of the Interior , in which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also involved in conc@@ ili@@ atory sounds .
from a departure from the double pass he is nothing .
we satisfy the discussion in Germany .
it should be careful , be not sen@@ sible .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban he declared constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is constitutional on all corners , and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed .
there is a lot in what could cause quar@@ rel .
but the SPD also tries to pro@@ filing an internal safety on the topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ auti@@ ously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet Volkswagen is still going through .
in spite of the diesel and@@ als , the delivery figures worldwide are rising worldwide .
but it is not available in all markets .
during the feedback action , the verteb@@ rates are about one term .
Volkswagen will start deliveries to the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest motor vehicle can result in the previous year despite the diesel aff@@ air thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ going markets further a plus .
but in July , Volkswagen dominated the VW &apos;s core brand , especially in Western Europe and loaded up the total sales again , as recorded in the D@@ ax company .
in July , with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales amounted to 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries of deliveries are almost one Six@@ th .
brand @-@ CEO Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , mainly on two sale days less in Europe .
in addition , there are also some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also imp@@ acted as a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA where the exhaust @-@ aff@@ air prepared first , it also stands for a min@@ us of be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the mainly concerned house brand of Lower Saxony will continue to be paid by the Diesel@@ sc@@ and@@ al : after the first seven months , only a non @-@ supplier deficit of 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
from January to July , he was able to forward a sales network from January to July .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles sold in this period , around 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW , the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output .
the vehicle branch office supplies the customer according to the retro@@ fitting a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but not from a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was called on Friday in business .
reason is legal refin@@ ement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported a warranty for the diesel models just before its German customers now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Commerce .
it was confirmed that this meeting was confirmed by the Ministry of Culture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfil the issues of my examination committee and KBA complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that at fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine output , after retro@@ fitting , no deteri@@ oration and all type approval of the car will remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not how it was called in business .
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen provides the possibility of having a half year after retro@@ fitting for example with a engine damage in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer interests , it is important to avoid that there is no other damage caused by et@@ ch@@ ai@@ ding to do nothing with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ and@@ al , as it was meant .
therefore , VW doesn &apos;t use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands greater savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers to park the 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Association of German Ban@@ ks speaks of a single incident and sees no signal : normal savings would not be afraid to pay for their savings banks . &quot;
if banks bor@@ row money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay 0.4 per cent penalty .
this charge requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future $ 400 per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been spent 40 million euros in the meantime , which could be withdrawn from one day to another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are with me on the central bank account and will result in 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can not lay 4000 Euros for every million . &quot;
the cost is further forward according to the caus@@ al principle .
the cash is easy to leave in the bar types of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four over@@ cases , I would not even have the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank &apos;s Chief Financial Officer .
most customers have understanding and change onto other investment forms .
only few hi@@ kes to other banks .
the &quot; cooperative society &quot; Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they only bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business economically not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for con@@ tours , credit cards or credit transfers .
with pen@@ sions for deposits of three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger is made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , principal managing director of the Bank of Bank , said : &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private consumers have to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany with banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ ele that is somewhat luxuri@@ ant from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank if they are free of charge .
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank of G@@ mund has offices in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ glad@@ bach , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks that calculate an acquisition rate for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of June , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich &apos;s President of the German Federal banks and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ feld ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich declares : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold , the neg@@ atives go to neg@@ atives , is very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ ves the immig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not leave the width in the width .
Dest@@ ination panels : who are actually buying sound plates ?
lon@@ ely men middle ages love sheets .
before you make the comment part in order to over@@ dos@@ ed him under the pseud@@ onym @-@ Non@@ ag@@ ger@@ m @-@ age with har@@ sh interests , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ th@@ v the complex recovery of sound plates do not want to achieve a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who would like to welcome the re@@ ty of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who have recently bought a record are all fo@@ resi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is not a hor@@ ror by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has a emotional significance : older record players remain your feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ th@@ v ?
if this blog was an news report on TV , I would follow me the camera , while I carry out a modest street in S@@ oho , a hum@@ ble suit and wild , before I stand , hold my hands and something serious , just as : &quot; so let &apos;s let us take a closer look . &quot;
so let &apos;s let us throw a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly entering its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where the formerly independent S@@ eller are located - is there as a hand@@ ful of a hand@@ ful record contract .
I would ask the camera permission to switch the camera to the next part , where I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind due to observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data : two young women , three men middle old age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men middle age , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this sound plates , shown above ( it has sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t have followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy boards that he could not aff@@ ord to buy themselves and buy items which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ a .
&quot; many things I buy , are of the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably too young to buy it , &quot; says he .
he is true that those who purchase sl@@ abs , rather release and glad@@ ly spend time to spend time , and adds : &quot; I smoke not and I drink not much .
this is my L@@ aster .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who are hits to the You@@ th@@ v @-@ Profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people , who are affected by the Medi@@ af@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and imagine to buy their old records again .
of the talks , which I have led , people usually have def@@ ended up their collection as early as 1998 or 1999 .
customers that sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy themselves their records , &quot; says he .
this would explain the boom of App@@ endi@@ ces of a certain age .
but what about the inn@@ ate emotional significance of records ?
it only takes some seconds in a business like phon@@ ica in order to detect that record business offers a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ ations .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers ass@@ ump@@ ed to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans will feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of familiar sil@@ enc@@ ers , from objects that qu@@ eu@@ e the happ@@ ier periods .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void , or the ownership of your possession , as a kind of comfort , &quot; says Weber .
that is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; not sol@@ dered a staff from a stack .
a survey of the IC@@ M revealed in April , that almost 50 % of people who have bought a plate over the last month , they haven &apos;t heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player they never use it , while 7 % are those who buy a plate , no record players .
at that time of the message report , I would probably look very careful , while working with a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three men aged aged ) has not@@ ices a &quot; t@@ rophy &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has recently been clean and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ platte , so I can put it into shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happened .
more productive , less musicians .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , no older who only come slowly .
F@@ opp , dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has an audi@@ ble audience , as I go clean .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts as the latest synthesis and sex@@ tet Pop instead of experimental speakers from speakers - is it good to see such di@@ li@@ ity in the customer .
none of them looks strange , but fixed psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to conc@@ ei@@ v@@ able if you stand up for 30 seconds in addition .
El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and sees the variation of the available records .

it doesn &apos;t des@@ erve a lot , therefore , it &apos;s no real option , says she .
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of sl@@ abs is ... &quot; it drives with a sig@@ h sig@@ h .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business , of which it is said that a new generation of record boards is to have inspired : urban out@@ ams .
while I give the ticket to the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants , I observe a group of young people who group car@@ es for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plat@@ ters from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential boards for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to hold them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that each attraction for those objects represent more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about themselves .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates .
even if my research noted that the results of You@@ th@@ v agree that , at least in record shops in S@@ oho , the great number of female collectors and record players exist in reality , turn@@ tables and online for@@ ums are not taken into account .
these people are possibly working at school or office in offices .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jung@@ le refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jung@@ le of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a hearing of this week , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should be competent to sell 72 temporary businesses within the camp &apos;s goods , sale , hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places would be over@@ thrown , because they would represent a parallel economy , that no tax would be paid out of which no tax would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ itation .
humanitarian groups divided the court that stores and restaurants are important , as the free meals provided by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , do not offer sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp .
in addition , they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need to offer .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who had to operate 72 temporary businesses , however , that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; could be completely re@@ trac@@ eable . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role as merely people to feed the &quot; in extremely pre@@ vent@@ ative conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats was the jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café in the camp , which is char@@ itable and with 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultancy regarding asylum seek@@ ers , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in stock .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; for these children were a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are old . &quot;
the two auxiliary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants estimates that the number of people in the jung@@ le has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - according to a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ings in the summer of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser needs to set off the next generation of proj@@ ections : in different German states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ ters being tested particularly effectively , the template is particularly effective .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers from the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden may be used for example an accident in order where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example on fre@@ eway @-@ construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary tem@@ ples , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a stationary b@@ itter for compliance with speed lim@@ iting .
a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or co@@ stly .
En@@ forcement Trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts five days at un@@ interrupted measurement mode , and the case data are transmitted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously through several tracks at the same time .
variable speed lim@@ iting and drive @-@ drive to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be super@@ vised .
you can move the pendant to the manufacturer according to the manufacturer with a trailer hit@@ ch .
in this way , it is not just st@@ acked , so it is lowered in the measuring process , so that the wheels are dis@@ cer@@ t@@ ted in the pan@@ eled and also dis@@ close the safe outside .
it is also possible to protect a built @-@ in alarm system from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to the data of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technology : recently , France gave 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ star Rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ time Rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt stop at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji granted a master class in the handling , side step@@ ping , after@@ mos@@ quit@@ oes , liner operation and raw power to win gold - her first Olympi@@ an wa@@ ist of every color .
the defeat was disp@@ uted by the non @-@ bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - British Britain in this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the B@@ ok@@ s , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
however , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the shape of this form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult road behind him .
eight years ago they lost under R@@ yan each game at Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this can@@ opy will be we@@ ary , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful , and ordered the attacks by GB@@ S from Sp@@ ass .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell an and Co . , when the World Series winner would run 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Col@@ in@@ is@@ au passed over the corner .
with still four minutes of game play Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i , added another attack from the right corner that he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly believe the ball .
a h@@ amp@@ er T@@ ackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third gate , but it has stopped Fi@@ ji only .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner had a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa , added a new since the re @-@ fi@@ ff , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ v@@ ou t@@ apped through further weak T@@ ackl@@ ing of GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion carried a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji , who was born to play 7 , while GB are still relevant .
so it is too .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time through and lock the fi@@ ji@@ an@@ ic gap ... for the whole four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a Br@@ illi@@ ant Stop play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Norton took a trial for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the southern Indian , whose fans were p@@ liers and dancing at the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the gaming approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the i @-@ cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ del@@ ta sli@@ pped , the Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished and GB , and they were beaten up in the lawn .
formerly on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated a semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought B@@ ok@@ s in the first half to the front , but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive foot@@ ed and achieved a gate among the post in the second half .
a brilli@@ antly late fac@@ tor@@ ing of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspi@@ res by the trainer of the train@@ ers to the rowing victory
there will be no emotional gold than for those games and that wants to be a hot gold .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve I found in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was present at present as they changed to the second Olympi@@ an old in a row , the first women in the history of British sport , which laid a scale of such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , all of you have 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ willing , which is also an exempl@@ ary .
what we see are two brilli@@ ants Athlet@@ es , which reflects the surface with the elegance of the elegance , reflec@@ ting not the nature of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he .
behind each gold in the rowing machine there is a batt@@ al@@ ion of content to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress , which make the difference and it was no more beneficial than the trainer that would not survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , he spreads anywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , was able to have the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if this is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , therefore I had to go better again soon .
it was an incenti@@ ve .
I was at the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it a larger one .
in the absence of winning their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerv@@ ous morning with a little bit more than otherwise , trying to process his own fears .
to see when the cent@@ ur@@ ion of the Royal Art@@ illery Reg@@ iment was in use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was a emotional wreck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated that how much I mean , how much I and Helen and I have worked Robin .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you for him . he is the best coach in the world .
I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to start up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to take away .
we had a good start and at the same time we didn &apos;t make something to do something t@@ oll@@ es .
we wanted to do this today no fire@@ works , we wanted to get a good result , going out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions regarding its future .
the Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Dar@@ shall .
now they just want to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all that new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of exempl@@ ary clarity for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ d group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , will go into retirement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian State &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose land used as a model for the large water producers .
so it was named some time ago in the original album of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken wer@@ aged the purposes .
the work of the wake @-@ up group is &quot; bay@@ ern well as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who worked for 31 years in the two @-@ year group , 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose group of the V@@ eit@@ s group , headquartered in K@@ otten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes around 15@@ 0000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and ste@@ eper with about 5500 inhabitants .
affili@@ ates are the municipalities of the church , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ren , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the Ba@@ un@@ ach town .
there are water supply agreements for more towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n @-@ Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up in 1985 as a water @-@ man and was appointed as the general manager for the purpose of the purpose .
&quot; his tasks are very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget of fees and contributions to emergency notes on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
when outstanding events they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land sales in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high vessels ( 1999 ) , the re@@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ building of water lines .
I had no halt and I have added new things again because water might cover life and drinking water the most important food .
in its Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , they praised G@@ öl@@ ler faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has lived with a lot of heart condition for his water @-@ purpose and lived regularly to the water @-@ purpose and he would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he became a real practition@@ er to present the success concept of the v@@ eit@@ ful control group in front of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken &apos;s Water Forum .
he has received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised the m@@ ist Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water and he was a faithful pop .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from its point of view , he designed the well @-@ structure of the purpose of the purpose .
but the biggest challenge and the tough@@ est application were the pi@@ g of the fun@@ eral on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees through the whole night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained once only because you filled the can@@ ister from the village of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , showing the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 and wounded them in killing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called upon us and given to have shot his life imprisonment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators is on the run , after him will be dis@@ closed .
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ burned , and has a smoo@@ ther .
meanwhile , the Police has released a picture of him .
now it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man has a Gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with itself , such as the police .
if Sven S. looks , the 110 is calling .

the sacrifice was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the competent police in Lübeck had to do no information on the T@@ ather@@ and relationship between the perpet@@ rators and the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , they confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a red@@ dish del@@ ik@@ t . &quot;

steel - Light view for German steel industry
the risk @-@ wound and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in a million@@ th height .
financial burden which the industry from the eco @-@ influ@@ x convey@@ s are threatened by the table .
it may remain with the Liberation of Renewable Energi@@ es on the so @-@ called own power production in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for the German General Newspaper , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) in the German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really happy that we were able to finally reach the negotiations for two years . &quot;
according to the European Commission , the European Commission had planned to use steel producers to insert the gases from the high stove to generate electricity generation for your own consumption .
according to the German industry sector , the steel industry added an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a standard certificate with the EU Commission for talks with the com@@ mis@@ sal Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators be replaced in steel units , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will be replaced .
but this will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall greeted the unification of Germany with the European Commission to the own power generation .
the status Quo of the current regulation will be largely re@@ written .
special meaning has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressed in Frankfurt , Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation intensi@@ fied , when the world &apos;s largest producer in China fell slightly on the global market in view of the weaker domestic demand .
European producers cast Chinese steel cont@@ am@@ ples .
in the course of this spring the situation has a bit relaxed .
one of the show@@ cases linked to import duties on imports , others have brigh@@ tened the economic prospects in China .
un@@ clear is how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry primary Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp continued on Thursday .
at last the prices were more stag@@ n@@ ated .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ yss@@ en@@ Krupp w@@ ished not to exclu@@ de some of the works of individual works .
at the end of 2015 around 86@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel producers remain careful in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced a weight of 3.4 million tonnes a good six percent less crude steel than in the same period of last month as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung der Stahl were divided on Friday .
following a short increase in May , the volumes continued the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production fell by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects to increase fuel consumption in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : sing seniors good
the singing has already accompanied all her life : as a young girl she worked in the school teacher , in the teacher department , and today he s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior citizen .
&quot; it moves me - emotional and physically . &quot; she describes them .
after a rehear@@ sal , it feels balanced , che@@ er@@ ful and lively , says she .
by the way it is doing good with her health and spirit .
for singing is equal to several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ackl@@ er from the Veter@@ an League .
most senior citizens sing together in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ackl@@ er .
through regular conventi@@ ons , seniors can link social contacts and maintain .
because frequently respon@@ dents social and family structures in the age , one ch@@ orus is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to organ@@ ise and organ@@ ise themselves to the other , to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of compositions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can sing in the positive sense , the tr@@ usses .
for doing , seniors has a deep and controlled re@@ spiration .
whoever ur@@ gently demands his lung regularly , the daily routine is not so fast from the pu@@ rest .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen is often a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Party of Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , the common s@@ ingen had a much higher score , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , explains them .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people were we@@ aken many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth time .
through li@@ ed@@ tex@@ tured and particularly melo@@ dies , people even suffer from long @-@ lying events .
if a special achievement is required , the head is asked to explain a special performance .
at the same time , focusing on their own voice and to concentrate on a specified rhythm - this is a big cogn@@ itive challenge .
the elderly people , who alone are living alone , do not only concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that they go through singing in the choir , the ackl@@ ist .
an enthusi@@ astic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ est@@ e@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
himself to show itself : if I do so long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there &apos;s enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate . even if he tells , little talent , don &apos;t hesitate .
you are not singing alone - at 50 sing@@ ly people who hears there if a tone goes to it ?
in search of the appropriate offer , seniors have various possibilities , says H@@ ackl@@ er .
if anyone s@@ ings from the known circle in a senior partner , one can simply join .
many cities provide over@@ views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
he who would like to sing in a church ch@@ orus , can directly apply to the church or church leaders .
many veter@@ ans &quot; feel also on the Internet .
if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask help by using the Internet .
who loves to sing , should join themselves a choir , and sl@@ ackl@@ es h@@ ackl@@ es .
singing the soul good and has a bit exemp@@ tion - this applies to any age .
cats react than c@@ ater to the young k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , what effect the herds of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys has grown to adult animals .
as a surprise , the male also didn &apos;t get the male too cold - however , they kept silence in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the occupation of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ auen of Little .
they react faster by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of Kitt@@ ens , who finds itself in great distress , as scientists from the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cats do not react to the ru@@ bs of k@@ itt@@ ens - but still the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the har@@ sh of less and strongly experienced young for the males either are not perc@@ ep@@ tible , or not of importance , &quot; the Bi@@ ologist said in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Con@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evolution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an earlier investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ scre@@ ams is differenti@@ ated with the ur@@ gency of their help .
a total of 9 adult male and eight cats from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry were observed .
they were played for a cr@@ ack of little ones who were taken out of the wor@@ d@@ box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to others , they were con@@ fron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger k@@ itt@@ ens that were up@@ lifted in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaning@@ ful .
&quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the cry , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned up faster to the speakers when this ru@@ bs played the very tough k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability might possibly be co @-@ born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males who responded to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already resear@@ ched the reactions of women and men on baby carriers .
as well as some studies show that women have been sensitive to infants , as if they were already mothers or not reported the Bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski g@@ lows with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Southern door is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued in Turkey around the three soccer star Hak@@ an Southern door .
he is accused of being a terrorist group in him .
an important football game takes place for the first time after the railroad attempt in Turkey .
ahead of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul with the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; has been told .
as early as the overthrow of the exceptional in July after the overthrow of the separation in July , the government , the everyday life of normal swe@@ ets could not be imp@@ aired .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of charge the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement .
it is not possible in front of the football .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Southern door , the Public Prosecutor offered an arrest warrant .
consequently , the South America &apos;s living room is accused of being a terrorist group in America .
the Sü@@ me@@ ber &apos;s Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len cross trainer should be responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although this is true for 90 days , the emergency condition is still valid until October , indeed , the life of most Turks have as good as no effect .
the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ winding &quot; on public places across the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for completion .
the sport is - like the whole country - split by pe@@ ans and ad@@ versaries of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of Arbeiter@@ bewegung Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as do not include traditionally to the friends of the President .
but what the Turks , however , in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict re@@ jection of military coup .
there are even the fans one - no matter whether your heart be@@ ats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ sieg@@ er &quot; Gala &quot; will arrive again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne &apos;s sporty value set up in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first game as top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way with his team secured the Cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for record champion took place .
after the Round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; Lion &quot; went out early in the Europe League .
in the South by Li@@ g , it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the game year was better for Master Be@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , which was given the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal income as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ g@@ g @-@ keeper .
that is the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
for doing so , the AC Florence had an agreement on the occasion of an arrest warrant known to Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , after the sec@@ tional trial of Gom@@ ez , due to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario must come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club boss F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who compl@@ ained about her starting right shortly before playing , was kick@@ ed out and stretched out at its start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a sm@@ iled smile , she had already become proud in the hall and prov@@ oked with their appearance .

here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in the Track &amp; Field Athlet@@ ics .
he was closed for two occasions ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .

bomb error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand up with the woman in contact with the wife , Thomas K@@ öll &apos;s spokes@@ man on Friday night .
they suffered inter@@ sec@@ t wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left this hospital .
she planned her home country for early September .
whether of the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on , also an Austrian citizen , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs exists in a permanent contact with local authorities , so b@@ oul@@ ders .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a district of two bombs .
according to the police , the police have been killed in Thailand and some 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning , two jumps went up , and there was a further man killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ uk@@ et was also reported in the morning as a bomb explosion .
a taxi driver was viol@@ ated by the Det@@ onation in the near of the popular swimming beach Pat@@ ong with the det@@ on@@ ator .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , the south @-@ east coast of the country explo@@ ded another bomb that killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities in a Blum@@ en@@ be@@ et , in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on at the south @-@ east coast of several publ@@ ishers .
it goes from a link with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , whose name was called Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army energet@@ ic Dan@@ ai crit@@ ically ee Friday journalist in Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express yourself about possible moti@@ ves - probably the actions of Muslim reb@@ els .
Thai media must recognize a sample in the attacks which is typical for the bomb of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the attacks did not relate to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ er movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only it is of that the bombs were placed by the opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
the authorities have received mysterious notes on the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they did not have been informed about the exact date and places .
let us be un@@ clear that the group behind the cover@@ ings point .
the police showed their officials throughout the country to strengthen the security of government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement quarter .
there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings in Thailand but they usually disc@@ ern@@ ed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j over the years .
after the well @-@ growing bombs explo@@ sions the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage to make the directives of Thai security authorities .
high level of safety ( safety level 3 ) con@@ es for the provinces of Nar@@ en@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
according to the disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , these are not necessary to take part in these provinces .
highest level of safety ( safety level 2 ) was awarded for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on one of the military j@@ unta .
this was spatial influence in the military , as well as in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , beha@@ ved himself to the Kingdom again to have stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting the CIA &apos;s secret insur@@ g@@ ents in the extreme south of the country since years .
in the conflict more than 6,@@ 500 people were killed .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , some of them were killed in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine of 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody assault of the real history of the country .
the right &quot; Id@@ yl@@ ant movement &quot; has come to the vis@@ or of the Federal Office of Constitutional Court .
after several offices , the constitutional complaint was also subjected to the Group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the social media movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement for asp@@ ir@@ ations against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said leader Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate at the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such as the Islamic faith or from the Near East will be diff@@ used in extreme cases .
therefore we observe the movement now .
the &quot; Id@@ yl@@ und Movement &quot; is a group of group roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it sp@@ ends against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ foreign affairs . &quot;
Constitutional protected in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Id@@ yl@@ ates &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority has worked closely with the offices .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Id@@ yl@@ ary movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the constitutional leader .
generally , extrem@@ ists try to arrange them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the Islam@@ ists as well as right homosexu@@ als .
that is not an advertis@@ ment for your own thing .
the propag@@ anda should appeal to the people emot@@ ionally .
young people are due in particular way .
that is dangerous .
recently , several federal states reports about contacts of the &quot; Id@@ yl@@ ates &quot; for Af@@ D policy .
Ma@@ ate said that he did not know any in@@ sights .
for the constitutional system the potential contacts of this species is only relevant from a certain point .
it comes to whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , which are in extrem@@ ist , its target direction and so extreme is .
the decisive factor is that such people contributed to the party .
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
with a view to the clear increase of mot@@ ions and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not yet talk about new terrorism .
but we have found in the last years that it can be righ@@ t@@ inn@@ ate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite good that further tim@@ ic@@ ist group@@ ings or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other legal circumstances .
however , a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of Just@@ r@@ or@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the groups were originated at the regional level or in social networks .
concerned Ma@@ ate about that many consider@@ ations went to the account of people who had not stepped in the right scene in advance .
that is the ar@@ ous@@ ed ar@@ ous@@ ed .
many of the facts on attacks on asylum are not known as crime , polit@@ ically motiv@@ ated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who had nothing to do with right @-@ sex@@ ist , who might have polit@@ ically in@@ different , or for example , CDU , SPD or Lin@@ ke , who , however , have become ra@@ dic@@ alised with the legitim@@ ate mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ans or world records for the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
in the aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly s@@ lu@@ cent s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was not able to see time in the TV pictures .
he disappeared simply - no matter how far the cut was selected .
Hab@@ its had then became the vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it in the social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his pre @-@ run 24 @-@ year @-@ old and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that moved to the attention of international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympic Games ?
C@@ Ethiop@@ ian was a special start@@ on from the international swim @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ divided countries .
since in Eth@@ op@@ ia the most athletes run , Hab@@ ré would have wanted to make something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap .
some media described him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL the W@@ al . &quot;
in response to a &quot; pro@@ sper@@ ity &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made it fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; over him .
his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds about the 100 meters Freestyle , played there no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL , &quot; were also pulled .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was atten@@ tive for media attention .
he was the performance of the E@@ qu@@ ator@@ ial Guinea as he had to compete in a pre@@ run over 100 metres Freestyle alone .
fr@@ en@@ et@@ ically was fired at the time Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump looks not so closely the dro@@ pl@@ ating election .
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks on a campaign event in Florida .
should it work with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already made an alternative video .
then he will go into the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be either fold , or I have a very nice , very nice holiday , &quot; said the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in an phone interview with the US TV channel CN@@ BC .
if it was not rich in order for him for reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is okay , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called the US President Barack Obama and the Candi@@ date of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist mil@@ itia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , however , more resistance changed .

Gf@@ K @-@ Guide accounts for dis@@ ap@@ pointing business numbers
the consumer research company Gf@@ K introduces its boss Matthias Hartmann .
the set@@ backs came back suddenly - but not quite un@@ expect@@ edly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K left out that the chair by CEO Matthias Hartmann became un@@ certain to stay longer lasting success .
tur@@ bul@@ ences at the top of the Nürn@@ berger Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business numbers and re@@ sign@@ ation of the company is the global number five of the industry in front of a human new beginning .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruit of the restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last poor Gf@@ K business numbers are sometime un@@ quiet at some time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is the case at BMW , this would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

accidents - Bus non@@ slip in cr@@ um@@ m@@ ble in tr@@ ench : eight wounded
an accident involving 43 senior citizens and passengers have been injured by eight people on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( Landkreis Aur@@ i ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered heavy injuries to the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travelling company from Eisen@@ ach had to decline their data according to an opposing L@@ aster that rode on the riding track .
the bus came to the right off the road and sli@@ pped into a tr@@ ench like a spokes@@ person of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
he came to the accident at Landes@@ strasse 2 , six different rescue cars and a ambul@@ ance .
the last travelers were brought from a liner bus to Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner &apos;s district .
there you should wait for a spare bus of the Travel@@ er company .
the investigations demanded the load driver and possible witnesses to sign up for the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste will be from 1 October 2016 for the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ cel@@ er@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the station in Az@@ endorf , the waste water is likely to increase at the latest , when appropriate improved measures will be necessary .
according to the relevant lim@@ estone , the wast@@ ew@@ ater price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that the budget of the budget is established by the Land@@ rat@@ ory Council , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater systems under@@ take sub@@ covers .
the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to maintain its legal basis because of its legal basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 citizens and industrial companies from the cos@@ mos , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to take deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as an administrative manager Herbert Schmidt on the board , a new cal@@ ulation of fees for waste water san@@ itation systems was necessary .
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also includes overseas and under@@ covers from the previous calendar period .
the gra@@ vey@@ ard increases shar@@ ehol@@ ding that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wer@@ age systems with a very low water waste disposal that varies between 6@@ 800 and 12,000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution base , for example , expenditure for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros were dis@@ rup@@ ted .
in addition , the waste water waste has declined slightly in all three systems .
still in the past cal@@ cul@@ ation period in all three plants , not least due to their age san@@ itation and repair applications were incur@@ red in a substantial extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for cos@@ mop@@ ed , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth , and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that in the Az@@ endorf waste water system , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ ster Wel@@ enk@@ ahl the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhau@@ led and cured at the pond environment , the se@@ wage sl@@ ud@@ ge had to be dispos@@ ed after almost 20 years , to maintain a further ventilation system in order to stop water legal requirements .
Schmidt : &quot; due to these extraordinary expenditure , the legal care and maintenance costs , which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the present level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made clear that the low tide wast@@ ew@@ ater for operation and maintenance &quot; were fully crossed in the three plants of the three plants .
in doing so , Schmidt added the market community of large maintenance costs in waste water systems , spar@@ ed spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned plants will continue to remain challenging , especially since you can &apos;t extend the area of san@@ itation of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ y@@ al se@@ wer@@ age to these plants , because it is a defic@@ it@@ ary facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; Effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bly opposite races .
with his filter tool , it allows more than 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities on such a way which already borders the ab@@ sur@@ d .
you can be converted into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ conditional , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million ligh@@ tings per day .
all mis@@ chi@@ pping will go to the public .
Snap@@ chat filter have pulled in the past cr@@ iti@@ que , in which they were accused of ex@@ to@@ ze the app Black@@ face convey@@ ors or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week , some Uz@@ ern proposed a filter , which gave them sl@@ otted , false teeth and uns@@ av@@ ed w@@ angen , they called a certain critic and rac@@ ial car@@ ic@@ ature of Asian - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ant . &quot;
they asked whether these repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y fell to a bigger problem , that the company has di@@ ver@@ ity .
the news and their indig@@ nation were dis@@ sem@@ inated on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered a debt : the filter was designed as a homage to An@@ ime characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asia .
but extra@@ ordin@@ arily standing , the rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us remin@@ ded , remin@@ ded of the filters of the viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the An@@ ime comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , an Korean American art student , who were widespread over the photos , that the filter &quot; viol@@ ently and hum@@ ble was in@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ part of a very contra@@ dic@@ tive Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not safe , but that the yel@@ low@@ ant has been pulled down .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that they crossed this cultural life @-@ pass .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ ation and integration campaign , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment that we all hold in the hand .
and Snap@@ shot huge audience of young people - who are in the race of various as their older players - could rather go out to expect Sen@@ si@@ vity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture creates , &quot; so it is much more difficult to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineering in medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account , and asked others to do it .

&quot; either , they have no several representation of people with other skin colors in their employees , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or feel good to say what about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , an appeal to the Snap@@ chat has not left un@@ answered .
the company publishes no numbers for the diversity of his employees and points out to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently ceased a personnel responsible , which focused on internal integration experiences and on internal integration demands .

military leadership , IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes Committee of Congress
military officers of the United States Central Command changed guidance information to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the real states to place in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , secret service and the military budget , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command secret services , reported as pre@@ set up its ass@@ ess@@ ments in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short c@@ enc@@ om , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , controls the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; News Conference information that were typically sent by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander of terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions before site , and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented in our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , rep@@ ublic@@ ans , rep@@ ublic@@ s of the House of Represent@@ atives .
exec@@ u@@ tives in Cent@@ Com range up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American forces in the development of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government peaks are given to Obama &apos;s instructions , it shows how an@@ alysts agree to pressure from their superior state , also known as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l , as well as IS@@ IS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly positive than it corresponds with facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Cent@@ Com was publicly known for example that a military response of Mos@@ aci@@ s could already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress held in Kansas , in a opinion .
from the mid @-@ year 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the Central Command Line changed the news reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after them has announced that an@@ alysts were wor@@ ried about Man@@ ipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings , while the investigation is continued .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports by the General Inspec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense in the G@@ ange .
on Thursday , the Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which co@@ inci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com ruled a revised process for the creation of downstream operations on I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the highest authority in the commander , member of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of author reports , &quot; bl@@ ended Mor@@ al under an@@ alysts and &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats agreed to have no evidence on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts on a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress of the congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
in August , the New York Times of investigations reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ torate , which were taken by Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts &apos; complaints according to Cent@@ Com An@@ alysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press brie@@ fing at the Pentagon , was in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would be able to comment on the Congress during the investigations of the general inspection course .
but he also gave him that &quot; expert opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversi@@ al discussion on these important topics of the National Defense . &quot;
the investigations have respect to the question of a successful air campaign in American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that has been made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , the question dropped to what president Obama can rely on the Central Command for the military operations of the military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret government remin@@ ders across the Islamic State , remin@@ ded of more than ten years ago as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , only a little crew in Iraq , looked forward and a little time to settle on the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led Mr. Hoo@@ kers according to government agencies , that contrary to the statements of the government had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this will not be published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s condem@@ nation commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature for his superior positive assessment of the war on a hearing before the Senate .
General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win four match in the field hockey on women , show@@ down a show@@ down with Britain before
a day after she had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually show a memor@@ able achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not included in the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , this doesn &apos;t know : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the British in the first place to remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two will gain from six teams of the first and second place in their group .
the first place fin@@ ishers will go a little longer out of the way that the other Group will lead .
as always the game is going to go out , the Americans are triggered by their success story a surprising work , four years after finishing the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a hockey r@@ ack@@ et in their hands ( her two older sisters were playing the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the 2008 Olympics as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team passed everything .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team , began to turn the things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural exchange , a mental change , and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t listen to the working day in London that we now have .
we have to pl@@ uck the ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the goal in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India passed without victory in the tournament in the game but the team showed sur@@ pris@@ ingly tough and maintained the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it completed a Sprint with the sh@@ allow ball over the left fl@@ ank , then moved to the ball into the gate around the American ones a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will be depending on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the heart of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are too late , the Olympic Games are too late .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and in@@ sof@@ ar , a rapid relay @-@ run between competition and competitions .
it is more than the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is an ign@@ ant staff , which turns off from the bracelet for the event to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to the TV , read a newspaper or when talking about your neigh@@ bors in the coffee shop , without talking about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ap@@ y or the dispute between Michael Ph@@ el@@ ps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of black with dimples , have had quite well known among these known names that were sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ being TV advertising , if he would have a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tr@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shade the sports species that are not generally acknowledged : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have it long .
but if I like a modest arguments for my particular Lieb@@ ling , then you leave the attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , it was the last 16 years that many which I had asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ an port@@ art .
that could also be regional Ig@@ no@@ ance .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines , until 2012 had an athl@@ ete , who made it to En@@ dr@@ unde .
the Chinese and the Russians ten@@ ds to divide the prices for both the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to share the women .
Dong Dong in China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ tro jump a certain outer side char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the sounds for the Olympic Games .
in this place , I should ad@@ mit that I am no expert , but only a bund@@ led enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ ously potential - the cart@@ ographic trem@@ bling of his never to end up - but also the gra@@ z@@ ie of the gym and diving , the two sports , which combines it essentially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dive board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
slow start jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ ug@@ ly and salad ) before they stood at the feet .
according to the official Olympics article , you will be evaluated for degree , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ ranking athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic V@@ ektor is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go on top of gold after gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , down and down on the playground .
they do not just hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in the TV broadcast also another minor goal : the world or the Olympic champion .
the goal oriented stre@@ ches is Nobel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic and it &apos;s enough to beat a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I myself playing for watching these games as a little fatigue .
the trampoline offers an open house .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ enti@@ es , seem@@ ingly heavier and like a ast@@ ron@@ aut , go to the top , then effortlessly back to the top .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , just the dre@@ amy , elegant period of time and gravity .
it is so Zen as the contest for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final friends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will grin@@ d the final round as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a calm , nice moment , one who will probably see in general tum@@ ult .
if the consciousness can only be reached through the att@@ aching and the obj@@ ec@@ tivity of male athletes - like the male U.S. Turner first proposed to the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his after air @-@ ring , new f@@ atten@@ d@@ ding .
&quot; one generation protest@@ ers &quot; in Ethiopia , long a union of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators that demand political changes in Ethiopia , shooting at a violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that many protest@@ ing during cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia just going to break together ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid composite of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government had sh@@ ook the country and increased steadily to more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and the required fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave that polic@@ emen killed and killed un@@ armed protest@@ ers .
in circulation , these are the protests all over the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals suggest young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand@@ ing against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority requires an incoming study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to stop this country and to become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous land of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
American military and secret services collabor@@ ates closely with Ethiop@@ ians , to fight terror@@ ists on the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ians economy expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has been dra@@ stically improved - there is a new end@@ end@@ point in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are normally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was more than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to continue the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , dis@@ sidents were dis@@ sidents effective to silence .
many were put into exile or put into prison , or put them into the wilderness of the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these no other options have to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in Central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth has been protest@@ ing .
one generation Protestant .
there are numerous complaints covering all from the floor up to the seas@@ oning with regard to power of the reg@@ imes of the reg@@ imes .
after a far @-@ critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the st@@ resses climb along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for these jag@@ ged , controversi@@ al line called for hundreds of lives .
survey@@ or fears that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden the tur@@ bul@@ ences have explo@@ ded over the past few years .
explain several factors , why feelings of failure after years is explo@@ ded under the surface under the surface .
the first appears harm@@ less : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ian people were able to communicate through the social media , because cheaper smartphones have been more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government locked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are at regular intervals , especially at protests , do many people still communicate over Internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they stop themselves .
several young Ethiop@@ ians said that they gathered themselves to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since E@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Eth@@ op@@ ia , predominantly in Christian re@@ developing countries , in the politics and the economy , while she explo@@ ited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in flat areas .
but this also changes .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated right by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population , and the military , in the secret services , in the trade and politics are dominant .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ public disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was considered the tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct that it was especially promised to perc@@ eive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers to edit opponents and make it harmful .
&quot; the current regime is missing on that fundam@@ entally , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict of conflict .
Ethiop@@ ians , new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ all@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
An@@ other than Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray in northern Arabia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
an@@ alysts predi@@ ct that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fears that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia was one of such u@@ pro@@ ar , in 2005 , after thousands against elections protest@@ ers the government had to ple@@ dge from the government and then stolen from the government .
during the following raid , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of the distur@@ b@@ ances went relatively fast .
development experts encouraged Ethiop@@ ian leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new p@@ end@@ os@@ cope , as well as for their meas@@ ur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously , this does not have the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ itation of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she takes a dangerous ethnic shape .
last month protest@@ ing in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ sh city , by Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hat@@ red opposite the Tig@@ ray is still pract@@ ised in the social media .
we say the protests in the USA and other Western Al@@ lies in an independent position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbouring Somalia , even if she had recently decided this basis has closed this basis .
during the west clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to squ@@ ee@@ zed his ally in a vol@@ at@@ ile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin @-@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama &apos;s asser@@ tion &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump did on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y to scatter his campaign by taking his repeatedly repeated claims , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State Islamic State , was not serious .
this clari@@ fication cast the new questions concerning the communication of the Republi@@ can candidate of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether it is capable of communic@@ ating and under@@ stand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ low@@ soldier , who should ende@@ av@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , which must declare that he could not be meant .
after he had made the evidence of a campaign event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the claim on Thursday and existed in interviews that he really didn &apos;t int@@ end to do , President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning he said , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ically .
in contrast to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said that he was completely serious .
when the conservative radio pres@@ enter Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help somewhat weak@@ ened the statement saying something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy that Mr. Obama would not want to destroy the Republi@@ can presidential candidate .
the last storm of criticism is taken on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to guide the focus of his campaign to the economic situation in question .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept speech to the economic situation of Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic .
in Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton Sug@@ gest@@ ions could lead to higher taxes , and that he has bor@@ ing its speech .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought Sar@@ at@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July , he moved strong criticism against him when he said , Mrs. Clin@@ tons emails were h@@ acked , but he later declared &quot; Natural meant . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the language limits in politics and then go back to ru@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages sent from his fans as they come , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication network , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think it &apos;s smart enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of shar@@ pen the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump accepted an error of its tone because his surveys have gone back .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his prov@@ oked statements , he is accused of understanding his critic@@ ising his statements or to understand his hum@@ or .
but while he ampli@@ fies the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze brought his loy@@ al mit@@ ers into the in@@ convenient situation to stand to him , regardless of how prov@@ oking his statements may also be .
Rud@@ olph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps prominent inter@@ c@@ ession , gave much effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was question@@ ed about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true that this sense , that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back ben@@ ches , entirely false and therefore , because he left the troops from Iraq .
most ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government had allowed the government to spread IS@@ IS in Mrs. Clinton to spread the situation in the Middle East , increasing the situation in the Middle East .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them ahead of his words to his words and vo@@ ke him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try him to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ott@@ ed over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Ent@@ ities as merely a further evidence that he was not suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point come back
ver@@ b Cafe was a mak@@ eup cafe in William@@ sburg , which was only able to pay only cash , but it was not a Wi @-@ Fi for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed off .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which opened in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of Cup@@ cakes .
there was a native city as the last loss in a gent@@ lem@@ an city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I &apos;m still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now an soap business . &quot;
but when New York is change , then it is new .
a re @-@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original site .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still fine .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time employee of the old caf@@ és , the owner and managing director of the new caf@@ és .
he began to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot .
the same distributor for the b@@ els bought the same es@@ presso construction model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu stand sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ ns like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é onions .
there are natur@@ ist bowls .
the café serves no beer , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ aff@@ ed electricity to the old customer .
&quot; many old customers were pushed for@@ ged by prizes from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was recently a new customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after returning to Green@@ point , it would take the way to himself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she was a while the coffee was called , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was clear that it was right on the coffee and in the culture that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they were on this day instead of the usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ standing and faithful customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before his work and he set his same as the same .
&quot; I came home after seven , every day , like a Swiss watch clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal has always got its usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ ove about it , that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of So@@ ap Ch@@ erie has actually being used to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the coffee bar .
&quot; I think we will go down on their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish citizens , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez announced that he will soon turn them out , so that his new neighbours welcome you .
the location also has other advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill and sell the bre@@ w@@ ed coffee into the bottles .

a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favorites for many customers .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief Apostle and said that he was destroyed in the ground as the café .

the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took part in the Oval Office .
as a Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Roosevelt a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue , like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland County Tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a ling@@ erie a p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food history .
Co@@ es last book &quot; CH@@ OP Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells us in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the Food perspective .
their newest cooperation , &quot; A contin@@ ual meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they show@@ cases culinary solidarity , when they meet with a repor@@ ter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ ör@@ gy snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive grove while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn did eat with m@@ ashed potatoes and mixture .
as the repor@@ ter he ordered , this was found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made of a ingredient and a somewhat cheap , which stretches out the ingredient .
imagine , so many pe@@ an@@ uts eat that they serve them as a dinner .
CO@@ E grin@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years ahead of the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male workers and it was fresh@@ ly fried , served as breakfast , lunch and dinner .
there were Americans that sent food during the first world war . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; distingu@@ ishes the trails on which the country went down to be no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ anced co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
similarly , the new bud@@ get@@ ed product was a mysterious food like bre@@ ads and cass@@ ettes , the c@@ asserole recipes , the c@@ asserole recipes , understood finish , because coo@@ ks could hide the appet@@ ite ingredients under a native sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry saus@@ age .
flesh , that was the core of the American kitchen , became a rare luxury .
respec@@ table bl@@ ends have been tried because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction to taste or even healthy kitchen decorations .
during their resear@@ ches for the book , which includes recipes , bricks prepared a dish from that ep@@ och , fried onions in pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; it was no more popular supplement on the lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match one another .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as ever before or ever since , bud@@ get@@ ary management - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the hab@@ its of the country &apos;s hab@@ its .
by pressing the recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encour@@ ages women to become acc@@ ord to transform , just like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rot in delicious meals to be justified .
&quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treat .
in particular , the reports about the response to the government is hungry for star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ Cake @-@ Essen .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa pe@@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ ill as the million heavy man of world , to whom it became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a well @-@ plated eating house and wore a Smoking .
he was a great reality .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same error , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to equi@@ p an ex@@ stamp with his stomach .
as described in the book , the house@@ holder introduced a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms. Roosevelt that the White House brought the slow@@ est food in Washington , but also one of the most tro@@ ut prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food , has been dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back on the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science was applied to food .
the pair gave me better to have learned the essence of her mother in law in law in law - for example , how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
Zi@@ egel@@ man remin@@ ded : &quot; they were actually sick . &quot;
there was the wind@@ le@@ ak .
after the plate was evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they mar@@ ched and cover a dessert which she had prepared at home : the pav@@ ement is covered , the President Roosevelt had lunch .
&quot; it will be called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a usual trick to be a modest name .
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone sigh@@ ted something like a spoon in the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
lu@@ ck@@ ily it was not bad .
CO@@ E won three times a night .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save the lives of their lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died on a mur@@ al attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil war group that according to Picture @-@ Newspaper has saved nearly 60,000 humans .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put her own life on the game to move people out of bom@@ bed houses and aff@@ ord first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil protective which shows him in a 11 hour salvation from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the shining symbols in the sight of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes , he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself had an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter have dropped four fac@@ bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respir@@ atory one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the gi@@ raff@@ le remains of the bomb , so not children playing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes the picture of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dead@@ ly bomb of the Assad regime must meet terror@@ ists .
Greenland : the oldest sp@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland . usually only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return on board the research ship S@@ anna into the sea after an investigation .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is floating with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland about 150 years of offspring .
in fact , the Greenland expedition along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is just 1.@@ 220 meters away .
only when it occurs , it accelerates the five meters long animal to a gradient of 2,6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this from long @-@ lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a god@@ father for a tall age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal Science &quot; in any case from Greenland , the 392 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he commented on Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the ev@@ olu@@ tionary biolog@@ ist suspected that Greenland become stone .
only lack the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are difficult to observe and finally live in the ice @-@ sea front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
because they had water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter .
on the lifestyle of Greenland , researchers know very little .
their period of time they emp@@ tied six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
nonetheless , this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks : on the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had sh@@ aded the jaw of a young polar bear .
possibly hunt them as@@ le@@ ep animals or pat@@ rol on the ground of the polar seas and looking for cad@@ aver which sw@@ ings from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland &apos;s , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ b@@ ard .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 is size .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises from the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained therein no more .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when atomic tests had increased major amounts of this radio@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
at 220 centi@@ metres in the length of the smallest animal , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from atomic bombs , it should be celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 .
in their lens ab@@ normal@@ ities , all larger carbon @-@ 14 amounts found in the atmosphere by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock was actually shown for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre long Greenland angle at 335 years , while the record shar@@ k could be even 392 years old .
the Greenland @-@ females only got offspring , if they are longer than four metres , was known .
well , researchers of the length could be assigned to age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably aimed at the threshold for sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks will be at least one and a half centuries .
also that should be world record for verteb@@ rates at the moment .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
even the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland expedition , penet@@ rated a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska .
through low temperatures frequently the organ@@ ism of the living animals live on savings of savings .
so you mature later - and at slow down .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals often are particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal is heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal is therefore dangerous and should focus on it as soon as possible as many offspring as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Evol@@ u@@ tion@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should invest its resources in a long life over it .

on issues surrounding the building , the Municipal Council shall mainly be discussed in the youngest session .
with relief , the Board took a statement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently acquired residential buildings can commence . &quot;
after the plot of land , par@@ cel@@ ery and closing requests , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Road travel &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Implem@@ enting Stage 1 ) is nothing more interested in the ways .

as it was called , building consent can be notified immediately in the City Hall , discuss@@ ing the default of par@@ c@@ els in its September session .
in order to do further questions to the annex@@ ation of further industrial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the newly created land plan in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of Lower lar@@ ion the business area has been extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main competition is therefore in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most of Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence Field markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .

indeed , in Paris , the Organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have become less significant than the ECB .
&quot; proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate as directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg resi@@ des a large fund range , but also just as Dublin at the infrastructure worse .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .

in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the consulting consulting Mer@@ cer arise the city on No.@@ 7 , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if living quality is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt may attract other banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , however , remains the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it vote .

a US official judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of legal costs which were created from H@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with pharmac@@ euticals Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead had liberated from a damages deposit of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster medic@@ ations of Sov@@ i@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge issued a pattern of false behavior between Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ eth@@ ical actions .

at Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton published their tax policy for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats and her husband &apos;s income tax of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in spe@@ ech@@ es ; the former Foreign Minister spent a revenues of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Sch@@ uster for her book on their ministry in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .

con@@ doms with chili powder , fire@@ works promote dance and elephant
Natur@@ cler@@ ics in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x art to hold eleph@@ ants to go in people living in human settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chili powder .
the method has proved to be effective as effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea ahead of years ago , combined with the US natural protection , trained by contributing volunteers in villages in the North Tanz@@ anian , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ way method to protect their homes and harvest@@ ing .
previously , many speakers have used to defend itself .
Friday is a holder of the animal protection , dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we could keep a change in their setup within these communities where they are able to damage the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not qu@@ it , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chili cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chili powder mixed with earth is packed with a fire@@ works body into a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ignition is only turned up@@ side down .
when it ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom is bur@@ ted with a button and spray the most fine dust to the air in the air .

in Berlin , a Jewish director moved to the Berlin Hotel as the Israeli pres@@ election was removed - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots established a media clock , after he had betrayed the fact that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli election in Berlin , since it declared Arab guests according to a staff member . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ aust@@ ere &quot; Shoah entered his doctors in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann was trying to find out Israel on the country telephone list of the hotel .
however , the country has not been listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room .
what happened in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via a separate call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer , which he got there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel reported that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; by the intervention of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason , that , behind him , dis@@ band@@ ed even more rage in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix was deleted , the employees of Lanz@@ mann was cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great confusion , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and falls .
that is really very advis@@ able .
the fact that this hotel has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame even .
there is no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correct conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dis@@ band@@ ed a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet , in which people called a sc@@ and@@ al .
some belonged to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been abandoned to the alleged Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was written in another article where it was pointed out that the hotel is situated in the no@@ zz@@ y Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly proved all ap@@ ologies of themselves and called the incident &quot; Ver@@ see &quot; and &quot; Dis@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to welcome Israel in the fast @-@ voting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Southern German newspaper a speaker of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code will now be added .

since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up against Iran , interest on pages of Russian companies grew shar@@ ply in the country , distributed as ambassador .
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to make access to the market .
of course , there is one of the largest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noticed that the trade rate between Russia and Iran amounted to 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade down@@ turn was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes to Russia for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign represent@@ ations had about 35,000 vis@@ as , primarily by Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , for the number of places in Russia .
it could say that the record number of Irish tourists was broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador is hop@@ ing that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the old Persian civil@@ ization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the quad@@ rants from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were en@@ vis@@ aged .
in order to bri@@ dging the time up to the next Rom@@ y journey of all minist@@ rants , about two years ago , the Minister of Ministers has decided to prepare a multi @-@ day pilgrimage to prepare .

on the evening before the priest , the pilgrims sent pilgrims to a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster &apos;s beloved wife is standing and so the pilgrimage of Münster was driven away from the town of Münster .
the individual day@@ tours were surrounded by a short im@@ pulse with various prayers , songs and texts in the morning and in the evening .

Scot@@ s@@ Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite Gold Pl@@ ate for cycling .
the Scottish team of Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste def@@ ended the title of men in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team def@@ ended the title of London in 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of the anch@@ or@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y who had made his estate and pro@@ ud@@ ly made the legend , when he stor@@ med into the house to get a victory from the favorites of New Zealand .
four years ago England claimed a sho@@ cking win while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ol@@ d@@ med@@ ail@@ len .
they repeated the trick , after they held in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did it in time as a hin@@ d .
plan@@ ys , a gap produced by K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they remained , when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ fold .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ship in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ still wounds the New Zealand also prevailed in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
he turned almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a strategy of strategy made a large part of transformation , with the execution in a higher gear to slow it down and tell them , and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC @-@ expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they came to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we put a olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there are no better way to win .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave him a weak start to the track .
he drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ections of English Ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem .
he said : &quot; it feels like London &apos;s entire GB flagship to the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we are so bad in so many world tit@@ els so bad that it was incredible again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing as well as in London .
if that a cash flow of our progress has been in the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape characteristic it is in the realm of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
it was born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; at the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the be@@ et@@ est of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will start over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something unique to win alone .
he said , &quot; When he gains two more gold medals , he should be beaten for the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there was another good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 942 on the finish line .
the record , who won gold in London in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 659 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the R@@ ower , while the W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he was fighting with the qualification before the qualification , when the officials were calling for him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women competition , which continued tomorrow and ended , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving behind his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and collect a s@@ ar in medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
it was playing drums in the background , so the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st sex@@ es and Mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ sis and the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ leton .
however , if you see the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks pretty thereafter , as the legendary reputation of GB@@ S that has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the melting of Portland due to repe@@ aling the energy supply
the future of aluminum mel@@ ts from Portland , Victoria , as well as hundreds of workers of workers - are standing on the game as the system operator will cancel the energy supply contract and thereby complete all delivery contracts , as the lie@@ u energy company over@@ took .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to operate the plant .
a maximinum payout of a maximinum payout of 20
up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are available on the game .
no less than 2000 stations -@@ direct and indirect - may be end@@ angered at a closing ceremony .
in addition to Domin@@ o@@ effects , there could be more than 10 percent of the total power generation Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 AL@@ CO@@ A joined the Point Henry melt , which led last year to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ky a closing time .
this step follows the many @-@ lasting spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a consequence of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity prices for the plant .
AG@@ L , which delivered the large aluminium shells with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that it assumes that three other owners will cancel their contracts .
the plant is located in the majority of a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are smaller propor@@ tions .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting company , &quot; divided the company .
AG@@ L continues to continue to be the &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which will come into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L proceeds from that the contracts in the 17 financial year will contribute to the revenue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential consequences for revenues to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong starting markets for wholesale electricity prices .
in its annual financial statements , AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of a termination . &quot;
AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting , or to ensure the power supply to the melting , &quot; not imp@@ aired . &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it had signed a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which had to come into force in November this year , even if it is still a statement dated why it has returned from the contract .
as a result of the poor economic conditions in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ato facility near Newcastle .
in reference to analy@@ st the analysis of analy@@ tics at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts and Tom@@ ago to around 900 megawatts .
if both plants should disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ z@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vog@@ ue

K@@ end@@ all , the ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people who love me , the sight of this co@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote me weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s family ) , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ cases of entertainment and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ isse ) , as they ends the cover of their sister and ending with a classic turn : they all have a surprise season .
this makes the kl@@ isch@@ ee@@ zed action stun@@ ted almost every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ clamation ) brought the sentence , &quot; you thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hon@@ esty of a cartoon of animation at 8 o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to participate in this public@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the September edition of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
K@@ end@@ all big sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue Gun will be beaten ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves .
September 2010 edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a volume that resem@@ bles a picture of a fashion magazine , the issue offers a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller with 615 @-@ page advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is expected to be ad@@ dic@@ ted in the last two years of the journal , before the official announcement of the journal .
women who were already on the cover is Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ r@@ ities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; than &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ acher J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - under the former category is , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous persons , or reality stars or you@@ ths of today , who know how to shooting a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes to yacht ) .
they are really talented women to draw back in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course Y@@ enn@@ ers does not like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was somewhat cl@@ amped in the fashion world .
in June , the lon@@ ging Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her Kol@@ leg@@ in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d named them &quot; the mist@@ akes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled up again when the message came out with the publication J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but to the Mis@@ sm@@ ut her@@ ite seems to go on the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vog@@ ue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
you are advertising for your lay@@ dation of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
and all their sisters sell you pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
it sells her made images from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
and in their leisure time they can see in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .

the director of the civil Cent@@ res of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or revealed that thousands of people had to be rejected by people each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation without the abol@@ ition of the German government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal centers are chron@@ ically sub@@ financed , which means thousands of people from important services that will need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who left violent relationships , people with un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able and impressive debt , families who have been released by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they don &apos;t need the help you need .
in June 2017 , the Federal Government shall be shortened by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people from Que@@ ens@@ land shall be forced to protect against their legal issues without any assistance .
we call for the Federal Minister of Federal Minister and the Federal Minister of Federal Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to keep these matur@@ ities immediately , so that people may need help with legal problems .
in the last year , the federal government filled its promise to raise funds for rec@@ ap@@ es on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the municipal centers and of their customers to view the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey conducted by country elections : SPD and CDU
during the following elections in the Federal State of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the government plans of the SPD and the CDU .
this distinguished representation of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; BI@@ LD &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could move closer to the north , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good chances to make head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD su@@ ed from 3@@ 5.6 percent to five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party saw only just under the CDU which could come back to 23 per cent .
third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ D .
the lens came to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the depreciation of the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament &apos;s Parliament .
the green leaves behind light losses with 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent ) again into the heav@@ y@@ day agricultural day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented by 3 per cent each in the Parliament .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD found the survey only by 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still saw the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
however , at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pir@@ ates would have to miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
in addition 20 years ago , the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a half kilograms and had more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight meg@@ abytes , that would be enough for approximately two ligh@@ ters with high resolution .
a iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet .
20 years ago , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone maker had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as a &quot; office in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ ent@@ Stone format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax , the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was sent .
even the access to the web site was possible with a HTML browser if too slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
rather proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros .
no one could see in August 1996 that the Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the wise phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the cell@@ ular phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and was handled .
the market is currently under @-@ hand provider that came all a lot later than Nokia .
ever and be online everywhere , this is today for very many people everyday .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple alone account for around 555 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment lies around 400 billion euros .
this is the well @-@ running business of the countless app @-@ provider and t@@ elecommunications configuration .
around the Smartphone , an entire industry has now been created .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communications , easy to use by touch screen .
the winner of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the neigh@@ bor .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention .
on average , every German now looks for 88 times a day on its mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to push the smartphone once again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , in the Siemens management of staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered to be a curse and blessing .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only in our local municipalities and in the whole of London , but in whole country renewal and pro@@ sper@@ ity .
for me , it was the biggest attraction in He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we were able to ensure a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be reached by creating new possibilities for or@@ ts@@ enti@@ ous and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local congregations there are already 10,000 new apprentices , 40,000 new jobs will create jobs and youth unemployment at the airport environment .
as they were ahead for us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of extension He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
it was told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will be bl@@ am@@ inate for us on the world stage .
in 2012 the bi@@ ans had in@@ justice and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers to answer any one .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
the expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion in hum@@ orous growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to leave the airport as well as in GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which was a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program that was elected by the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequencies from the world .
now they are ready to supply a third running ste@@ er , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that the He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time that we direc@@ ting this Olympic Spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ er &quot; concerning display block
for companies who want to earn money with online reputation , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to handle , a &quot; Kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that advertising block@@ ings would block on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page , published Ad@@ block Plus a Blo@@ g@@ post , in which it could update their filters in the program to block advertis@@ ements in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook explained that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding in terms of advertis@@ ements related to its advertis@@ ements , which is part of advertisement that is part of the page advertising , to be replaced .
but Ad@@ just announced that there has been a new way to get new codes .
in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the lock@@ able open source community and the re@@ plac@@ ements are already underway since the invention of displays in the G@@ ange , and it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has dropped in the fight , is a strong indi@@ an indicator for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide , this is nearly four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users active on Facebook over their mobile devices , hand @-@ advertising and 84 percent of the advertising are not@@ eb@@ ooks .
the company has been upgraded to desktop computers to desktop PCs , since mobile advertising block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ eb@@ ooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man distributed .
advertisement on desktop computers makes a sufficient amount of income from , so on Facebook the investment of such a ped@@ ometer appears as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would have been able to upgrade its &quot; ad pre@@ ference &quot; tool to make people more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying , because it would also block contents on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the user this is no positive experience , so we plan to address the issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person for Facebook in an e @-@ mail Noti@@ fication &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

woman committed suicide on Swiss fre@@ eway
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the fre@@ eway .
the police calls to witness after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday of an assumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened at the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the Dun@@ kl@@ es in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss girl in the age of 49 years , that of several vehicles , including a truck , would have to kill themselves .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified , said the police , those , as well as each voucher of the pre@@ dat@@ or to report to sign up .
it was opened an investigation method which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter dem Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however it remains to wait for whether one of the driver will be indicated .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
that is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years have shown that drivers will not be considered for responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran at the Dun@@ kl@@ es on the highway - was decided that the drivers do not need to go out that a pedestri@@ ans run in the middle on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acquitted of the negli@@ gence after they had a man over and killed , which was placed on the A1 at the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and on the street was un@@ conscious .
the Court confirmed that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- that had answered on a emergency call -- based on a man &apos;s justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; an extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the Judge .
any further information regarding the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate change : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model probably hab@@ itable .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA has developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble them of climate resear@@ ches .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once d@@ anced with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 tight atmosphere once en@@ similar conditions .
scientists have previously noted that the slow circulation of Venus could be declared by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere , and slowly continue to move slowly .
the model lighted the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet thought to have probably more dry regions than the earth , but had once enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun that matter 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS @-@ model simulation , the slow circulation of Venus is nearly two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a ra@@ iny , in order to reduce the surface of the bulk of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than the earth today .
the model presented a history of the Venus that was similar to evolution that had previously assumed by Plan@@ etary researchers .
although it was formerly known to be inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years , was exposed to heat and ultra@@ violet light .
its oceans are evap@@ or@@ ated and vap@@ our of water vap@@ or was burned down by ultra@@ violet light .
when their Hydro@@ gen dischar@@ ged only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a dead@@ ly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers split the findings of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy goes back as a train@@ ee of the Aval@@ an@@ che
on Thursday , Patrick Roy stepped down as a coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che to become a fundamental decision on the team &apos;s decision @-@ making .
alternatively , President and General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and notice that the club will immediately search for a new coach immediately .
&quot; during the last three years , I have performed my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and act@@ ness , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position .
in the course of summer long and much , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more deep , this is needed and bring it to higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations will be perfectly matched to the organization .
he also has to have a co @-@ determination of decisions who influence the performance of the team .
these conditions do not be met .
Sak@@ ic , who had already hung himself on May 23 , 2013 , was with him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we estimate all what he did for our organization and wish him for the future only the best .
Roy was honoured during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best train@@ ers of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and placed on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Play@@ offs of Minnesota and missed the season for each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ ar@@ ches recorded in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second wild @-@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
the Hall of Fame Tor@@ ry won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ e@@ lar@@ us take talks to continue this strike
the workers &quot; labor strug@@ gles with the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea talks will be suspended during all parties for a new round of discussion on the table , the negoti@@ ator leaders .
strikes against the wood @-@ field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ a@@ dish on platforms in the North Sea that are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ite and war@@ med unions can confirm that we have united us to begin the current dispute process , i.e. it is in a common declaration .
we will pause several daily sessions within the next weeks , starting the beginning of next year to re@@ boot the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against potential wage reductions of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group won the R@@ aten to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent drop for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts required to the company needed in order to come across the market down@@ turn .
as a result of thousands of people , Shell has granted its part to thousands of people and plans to susp@@ end his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as a result of his mega @-@ flame ret@@ ali@@ ation with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are located due to lower crude oil prices under pressure , an economic situation that decreased by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament of Dave Anderson took place in the beginning of this week with workers &quot; workers to discuss one of the biggest disp@@ utes who took place in the North Sea .
North Sea is important for regional economy , said he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we require a economy that works for many and not just for few works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Kepler measures speed of stars in the star scene of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
astronom@@ ers have helped the latest mission with the Kepler space teles@@ cope to collect the most completed catalogue on the stars of the star of the Ple@@ y@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational period of planet are standing .
we hope that we learn through the same of our results with other star@@ ters , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ orn , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 445 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this constellation came from around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
it is now on the fastest way .
this stri@@ ve stars of star@@ ving large amounts of star@@ ving .
since this winch has travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star has aged , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recogni@@ zes the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ z@@ able star spot -- how to recognize sunlight .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive star slower than less massive stars .
re@@ bel compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters as smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Ple@@ y@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be more massive , whereas better rot@@ ors will tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star cluster of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic lab to compare medical qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star@@ ring of the Ple@@ y@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot of us how we would like to learn more about how , W@@ ann and Why star@@ ters slow@@ s down their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ orn and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the operation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ adas , which soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .

&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ b@@ ye &apos; to the , declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participant of the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Y@@ ank@@ ee .
since 2007 , his signature offered under a ten @-@ year contract covering US $ 27 million per ann@@ um .
as an advisor and youth coach at the end of December 31 , 2017 , he is now served as an advisor and youth coach - with full content .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez deposited a long time with power .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping events
caught : due to a positive offset sample , it must not start the lif@@ ter of Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ aded by the first official dos@@ sier .
an athl@@ ete of Ath@@ os had won almost a medal .
in front of the seventh race day the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ cases became known in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wis@@ s Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre ste@@ ep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish weight @-@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the recognition in critical athlet@@ ics competitions this news occur at the un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ d has been proved last Sunday , which is used as m@@ asked means of d@@ oping substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part more than 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has requested opening the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
the national association take the matter &apos; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; we will co@@ operate with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , who went 33 @-@ year @-@ old to join the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
she could be innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; said the athlet@@ ics .
according to the report , it is said to act with the associated substance around blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ents EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa is suspended provisional position , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ jko Bor@@ is@@ sow applied continuously with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men pull not the right sn@@ aps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have stood under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all weigh@@ t@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ loading nation can not be able to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the fall of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had already been positive on the an@@ all@@ ast@@ ero@@ id N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both contest the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is particularly important for the repression of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had to start the start of the entire Russian team until one exception because of system@@ atically po@@ op@@ ings , Kenya has also produced numerous bad news .
in the swim sports , the previous publ@@ ishers in China had also ensured a violent disp@@ utes between athletes .
for instance , the Fr@@ ench@@ man Camil@@ le Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sh .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot; .
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I want to pass , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in French radio .
sun also stood at the centre of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping beds , &quot; said this .
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese championships positive on the stim@@ ulus in Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
datashe@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ acker their rans@@ om
programmer from Er@@ press@@ fitting malware reach latest companies at a moment - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of the malware er specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes below 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once in the past twelve months , partly several victims of an attack by pressing software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the goal of an R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware refund .
40 percent of victims paid will@@ ingly to the perpet@@ rators required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators are specialized in accordance with the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes and fixing into corporate networks , according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes .
if they are successful there , the potentially lim@@ iting rans@@ om is significantly higher than with private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently watch a sho@@ ck@@ ingly fast evolution of the claim , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most pain@@ ters were still designed to send advertising to advertising .
then the Daily Al@@ pressing software discovered for itself .
only private use was the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking was fri@@ gh@@ tening in the past few months .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a sacrifice , it is searching for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archive of pictures and videos .
these files are encrypted with R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently , the software introduces the requirements of the comp@@ ress@@ ors .
to get the final key code to get files , the victims must as@@ sign money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ mal@@ nutrition Bit@@ coin - .
but wherever private use the personal photo database on the game stands , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without leaving the production .
accordingly , the damage is due to damage when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware hit .
22 percent of the affected German companies had reported sales losses by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent had to stop the activities completely , in case of cases were people in Fat@@ al .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of ambul@@ ances .
&quot; we say to the victims &quot; : pay not , you only promotes this problem , &quot; says K@@ ob@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to remove the demand of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researcher from F @-@ Secure exam@@ ines the user areas and the contact with the ex@@ presses , and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to re@@ build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and they will be punished according to payments of a few hundreds of euros , companies must pay part hard negoti@@ ating and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ turn@@ key .
in view of the potential high and relative risks of the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware refund the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and split the work , explains the security specialists Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski , by Internet @-@ vend@@ or SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their damages software then in the form of a software box to the actual comp@@ ress@@ ors .
the previous malware kits were created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a one @-@ time fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delivery includes a Adap@@ tation tool , allowing for smaller configurations , look like appearance and bran@@ ding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pressing is then looking for further h@@ acker in order to spread the fresh@@ ly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
in one of the for@@ ums , in one of the for@@ ums , buy the set of a crime and contrac@@ ted one other to install the software on the many PCs as possible .
payment is made per ann@@ um calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the crimin@@ als will carry Sp@@ umber with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known with many companies that secure their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies data processors in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware caused by file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone cannot be sufficient for successful discre@@ tion , the perpet@@ rators , instead of sensitive data , such as customer lists or price quot@@ ations , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ z@@ yn@@ ski .
this makes the claim potential depending on the type of data by a multiple than before .
even the perpet@@ rators in the future could take completely new targets on the internet of things .
on the ground @-@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , such as they could get a connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the doors of a der@@ ision could be quite a rans@@ om for a good victim .
if the perpet@@ rators , instead of heating in the future , block a whole production line in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack all : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ load , but the HR V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has been really flexible in everyday life than extremely flexible .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V was rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , there is no place closely .
the materials of the inner surface are well processed and work enjoyable , only the cockpit top falls off there .
more versatile than similar vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
it is not only available a trunk of 453 l at high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l in inver@@ ted back @-@ backs , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be up@@ swing like Kin@@ os@@ kettle and offer dust storage that is high from floor to ceilings to 1.@@ 24 m high .
the boot space can be loaded well , however , the height of the charger with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l @-@ Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .

better traffic flow on the motorway
it regularly stands on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is said to change : the legal basis should be extended .
this is good news for all car motor@@ cyclists who stand in the professional traffic on the ambient road every evening in the st@@ au when travelling over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the regional traffic construction is extended to the upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Depart@@ eler Street , the right track gauge track by 700 meters .
drivers can go right from the hammer to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic will early be early , which means that the general release is improved on the multiple section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea for the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district , representation of Münster @-@ West .
the lane on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ es the driver before between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back of the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping trail and sometimes also beyond that .
the reason is the dot position on the B 51 just before the Depart@@ eler Street .
from here traffic will only be accessed via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back well in three @-@ four@@ ths ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge possesses no more the required load capacity to absorb the heavy duty @-@ traffic .
as long this Eng@@ ines and the other band@@ age lasting longer stays , the competent Local Court cannot say .
however , to calculate with years : for the bridge has an official stay of stay up to 20@@ 34 .
for extending the legal ab@@ rate @-@ esp@@ an the state operation has been deliber@@ ately looking for the public holidays in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .
the traffic will be guided at the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .

relaxing night : tips against sleeping trou@@ bles
in the evening you can be rolled up for ever , at night you wake up hours . in the morning you don &apos;t forget to think of sleep anymore .
it &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent are often found out of sleep or permanently relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ b@@ ances , and there are among them many causes are under@@ lying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Sle@@ ep F@@ asting and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you look forward among them , but is the In@@ som@@ nie , so I have an input and as@@ le@@ ep sound .
straight , many people are going to sleep as harm@@ less or in@@ adequate , as Jens Wag@@ ons , member of the German house medical association with medical practice in Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleeping trou@@ bles ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , psych@@ ic or behaviour @-@ related factors can also take medic@@ ations .
un@@ sel@@ dom is the sleep distur@@ bing expression of another condition .
&quot; very early awak@@ ening is common primarily with depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it may be that various factors need to go to one another .
those who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be po@@ or@@ ly , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and starts wom@@ ens@@ able to gre@@ et about everyday problems and to gre@@ et , We@@ e@@ ß is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when do you deal with sleep distur@@ b@@ ance to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week and imp@@ aired on the day should be doctor .
the influence can look completely different : it is struck , tired , un@@ folding , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical problems like stomach or head@@ ache .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is essential to find out their causes .
as a treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medic@@ ations - classic bed@@ tablets only in the exceptional case and the maximum for two weeks - in@@ quiries .
in Germany , there are hardly under@@ lines of living @-@ medi@@ a@@ esth@@ esia in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore one should consult with sleeping difficulties first at the doctor , We@@ ß We@@ e@@ ß .
it can be clari@@ fy if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleeping laboratory , and what happens ?
to study in the sleep laboratory , physician , for example , in case of snap@@ shot with breath@@ ability to sleep during sleep or if you do not find the cause of as@@ le@@ ep sound .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just please do not have lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the wired , one goes to the bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body one carries a nose @-@ br@@ ille , a chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger .
furthermore , a camera stands on the blank@@ et of the sleeping .
how can people affected the problems in the handle ?
there are rather many positions to which one can set for better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular bed@@ - and rise times , not too long in bed , in the day not sleep , not television to sleep , alcohol , and at night not at the watch - then you start instantly up , and that &apos;s all and absolutely not eligible .
what the jung@@ le Camp with lack of medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold a dis@@ ap@@ pointing off of the DS@@ V teams for Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold at the World Cup Championship in Doha , and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has been protected by fac@@ ebook in front of his critic@@ ized ex team @-@ mates .
&quot; in a country where a Olympics win 20,000 € reward and a jung@@ le of 150,000 € , nobody would wonder about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Friday night on his Facebook page .
the feed system in swim sport would be bad , however , the d@@ oping control system was very good .
with that , we can not compete with countries that are very much promoting and not able to see that exactly or so it can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback already in nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly what you should do with countries .

airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage arrested
professional Di@@ pping at the Düsseldorf Airport
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the facts alleged as a ban@@ de , several pocket and baggage st@@ oves .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civil servants in the field of Düsseldorf &apos;s airport was again known , which was known to the police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since the middle of July this year and were involved in operation and particularly profession@@ ally .
the specialists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can im@@ press the di@@ ots that had jour@@ ne@@ yed for criminal off@@ ences to Germany , in four ways .
they took a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
Alt@@ built , a few lens springs , in between still a remainder of the head pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain works at the first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east to west , you come to playing places , a refresh@@ ment &apos;s playground and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a grey house someone has ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which soon to be demolished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and a total of 133 new studio apartments .
article about this trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls in the last weeks , however , pre@@ fers with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts located on the ground floor are yet occupied spaces and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , since the beginning of the year , right for a hard drive of the police against the project , the area known as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after on 22 June , the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , were pat@@ rol three weeks from official statements , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three club car on site , locked parts of the road , and held visitors to the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , identical construction workers on behalf of the unknown household owners offered the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration decided that the clearance was illegal and one day later , police and construction workers under the Jewish of sympath@@ izers and residents .
in this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents go with children , people sit on the brush in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main or@@ ge of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the area since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which has been attrac@@ ting three children , especially from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the skin projects , they divide the care before increasing and gent@@ lem@@ ons .
it does not sound according to a pine , who wish to wish to arrange a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ al@@ ating left .
the tr@@ ench , which the Berlin interior and the police turn up between squ@@ att@@ ing and their neighbours , obviously not exists .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional labour quarter , which is even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average and high risk of poverty .
the occupied housing projects and the resulting residential projects are already long to the area : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire main@@ z street , close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under large police force , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er , and are partly inhabited by people , who had occupied them from 26 years ago .
at the same time , the quarter in the past years has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ toral lin@@ ers from around the world : with them now , people from GDR @-@ times and former house occupied their p@@ ines .
this can also be felt in the rent which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ builds on the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them from the raised discs or fresh@@ ly damaged fac@@ ades that were dis@@ car@@ ded with color damage .
no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for that , not all neighbours must be regarded as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by the crime , according to criminal off@@ ences , according to terrorism , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the offen@@ ders make damage to new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house for 17 years in addition to the controversi@@ al 94 , no speech may be no speech .
what violence acts , is it crucial : people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who were certainly not .
also the famous burning cars can be delivered directly to the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
for the studied Archit@@ ec@@ in is not a criminal fuel point , on the contrary : &quot; here you can find one another , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than what else . &quot;
in Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße and remained .
therefore , it was so important that the people resi@@ des their road : from the police , politics and the media , who came in in July all of the De@@ ut@@ ory understanding over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer will continue to move away : by prov@@ oking newly built new buildings in former buildings that for@@ ce@@ ases the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the con@@ domin@@ iums that are not interesting here for many people - here are people who are not so well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I do absolutely not look . &quot;
but what should I do if someone does not hear anything ?
there is fru@@ stration in all sides , even with the police and the residents .
for the tra@@ iled , the st@@ icky bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the p@@ ines .
anyone who goes on , should be aware of it - just like anyone who attrac@@ ts himself in a K@@ nei@@ pen@@ se , there can be po@@ or@@ ly compl@@ ain about noise in there .
all of the names presented with names submitted should not be called to be called by their real name .
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee camp
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ ational .
in addition , she is a social worker on site .
in July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
social ped@@ agog@@ ical support the team of management by Ach@@ im Gro@@ w berger .
she sees himself as a partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities , and who else was missing .
RE@@ G@@ INE client from working groups indicates that the honorary citizen is more than@@ k@@ ful , that Deu@@ ver@@ t is now there , the e@@ ager he@@ at@@ chs@@ au which is especially a problem .
so some - less sp@@ ott@@ ingly than rather than the multitude of what would require , in fact , when the administration wanted to write the job .
we sought a management team with a talent for languages and people , connected to a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work .
but administration is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le .
above all , we go to organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with it for about six weeks .
she has a 50 percent job on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Engl@@ ish@@ le hon@@ ors and capit@@ als are supported .
there are big and small issues , organiz@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the dairy street
since some time , there has been a serious problem for some time units that have been recognized for the connecting tours that have been recognized .
for the connection of the connection , the municipalities are responsible .
they must accept the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the costs of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must wear the municipalities themselves .
responsibility changes from Land@@ rat@@ chet to Commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer its apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de fac@@ to finds no private apartments .
so far did it not work , you have been promp@@ ted to private apartments , so Deu@@ ver@@ t .
therefore , non @-@ binding dwellings must be deemed necessary as it is so fair .
so soon as soon as soon as new containers are installed in the washer street .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Engl@@ ish@@ le embr@@ ace .
apart from a permanent stay there are trainees , training places , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who have to be gre@@ ed or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help , non @-@ profit char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates how An@@ ni@@ ka Engl@@ ish@@ le reports .
it is hop@@ ing to ensure that the work leads to a positive external effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
that is not only work .
the day require a solid structure , say goo@@ d@@ le and customer .
the people would have to develop a sen@@ i@@ ority .
so do offers offers such as sport , contacts with local and especially language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so you can ski@@ p your board and honorary citizens .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they welcome them in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it only takes to make them meaning@@ fully with them , for example with language courses .
whoever wants to feel the feeling that he could not work in Ur@@ bach there may not work , neither be un@@ profitable , who would never be able to integrate .
the significant majority be motiv@@ ated .
problems also , however , says the customer hon@@ est@@ ly , &quot; people , where nothing goes to . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ t and the customer is therefore always too motiv@@ ating others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mamm@@ alog@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do they both have become afraid of radi@@ cal@@ ization in front of radi@@ cal@@ ization , even in a small village like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher might call n@@ ai@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a residual risk and don &apos;t want to exclu@@ de them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sen@@ si@@ zing be the hel@@ pers already .
these incid@@ ents are also subject to refugees .
they are wor@@ ried that the attacks carried them completely in ob@@ itu@@ aries .
&quot; they want to show that they are nothing to do , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honour of guests must be met on site and in the region according to activities .
in the background , they are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants might come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
this question is clear to answer this question .
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there , where we want to go , &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Engl@@ ish@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
RE@@ G@@ INE Client also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been appropriate to integrate existing people reasonable .
these are currently around 100 persons , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women are single .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
chim@@ ney : in@@ crimin@@ als related to Hel@@ icop@@ ter
