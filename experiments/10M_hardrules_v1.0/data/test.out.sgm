<seg id="1">Clint and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: IT's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - that's to both Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidate, however, are among the tax and energy policies as well as in a basic query.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental difference of more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The importance of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns, as the state of the economy harm - with taxes and taxes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton to put his death to death and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But by contrast, he was very different, said trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will repaid rafts massively, and he will take care of far tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to open, he has disadvantageous opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the wealthy would rise, says she.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">To invest in the leash, Trump and Clinton's almost wortful.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes into the infrastructure include classical democratic politics and become rejected by the state-critical Teachy wings of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">The internal discussions could be added to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">More significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and drive the coal extraction in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction has also been possible to cancel the protected areas in the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to expand the renewable energies against their investment program and calls: "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create million jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is probably either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only for infrastructure - even with international trade agreements the two competitors are not far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Gazide trade agreement, don't want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both wanders would not isolate the international trade, but only American jobs are better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They then are supposed to be paid better, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be down, then he says he shall not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably develop rather to develop the control policies of both camp.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him, so the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton wants to demand at least of the wealom that they would pay more taxes, and their critics saying: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="25">In her homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>

<seg id="31">Too, all women in refugee camps were often deemed to be considered underminating and worse than misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to the fact that approximately 90 per cent of women living in the Munich area are traumatised, estimates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children were certainly not volunteered."</seg>

<seg id="38">On the question whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich, in their authority area, answer some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in the governments of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone there are not only separated women, Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle franken is available in some common floors or private houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two key accommodations solely for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The European Parliament's rights and gender equality has also calls for women to be separated from men in the European Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published by the Committee, it is said: "it is very important that men and women can be separated."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Relations"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and claim an official end of the eight months of lasting war in the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counteracting in the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot forbid me that Ankara wants to reconcile these reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a blow, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putting the smiles worked narrower and radiated warmth, even for his return to the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, said repeatedly to his" "" "friend" "" "Putin - according to a report of five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to crisis, but can even improve themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have occurred as it would never happen something worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">My enthusiasm appeared to me rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant and sustainable cooling demonstrated that the Russian government had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the reason of the crisis was the first, what he mentioned in his execution: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was wroneous.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The move was even bigger as it was committed by a good friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetropes rebuild again will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media held a violent, unrestricted attack against Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed to bear all the guilt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the most difficult, the allegations of senior officials conducted that Erdogan had benefited own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, who will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He was disputed of this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message said that it was time to look forward to the front.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of the President of Erdogan to the debt that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of an armistice are clear at hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs all friends who can get started after spending last month with a failed coup d "état almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical designs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have taken their importance - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has dropped by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agents and Charter companies will be facilitated when the flights will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late summer onslaught of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecast the State television inexpensive fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural exports are imported again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it like this: "tourists there long, tomatoes here."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is astonishing in the West, since there was a reaction to the question of power to put in a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To do this, the continued groroll through the snow-stamp of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pippike to pull out the cool mood and reduce the relation of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian State government won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara with security that he asked for the attempted coup d'etat in favour of the chosen organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is well-known for Moscow a self-intelligibility, which even has to change a deep breath in front of rain.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace of the sea facilitated Russia and Turkey, a similar way to me as an analysis of analyst, "Alliance of outside lateral" states: two countries taking off the west and poorly to feel badly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is in Syria, where Moscow has recently been the role of peace times, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual connections.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be characteristic that after almost three hours of chancakes, both presidents on the press conference said they did not get the topic once again.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey didn't expect to reply to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to accentuate this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey quoss the Russian combat jet - surely it is certainly better that the two heads of state will speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin it is said that Putin have ordered his duties for the dismission of his duties as chair of the Russian presidialAdministration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Ivanovs's deputy, has been appointed to his successor since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn, in the Estonian capital, in Tallinn, he graduated at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of Kremlin it is (in Russian) that he later was a journal manager and Deputy Head of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">On his appointment, he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support their activities as head of government and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked therefore to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuading the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has been mysteriously in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time of the narrowest confidentists Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, who had been broadcasted on TV, both men claimed that Chief of Staff returned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the lungs for cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is there thus a consequence of a kind of power?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once appeared as a potential president to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov "it's true that I have asked you to do this very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - you could have to mention this very much more than four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it emerged, I have been chairman of the Russian presidialAdministration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin became a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">He called his name to power Ivanov as one of five people, whom he confided in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov was assumed to be the second term of office in Russia, as a third term, putting Putin to the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, nearer ally putting Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Brown's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Green my: investors should become much stronger into the duty in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How is it reacts on the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 favorable apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD beats a "hand-concept living" for the next ratch.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First line is about the question: who should actually build the favourable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">SPD faction Chairman Christoph Frmann writes: "we are pleased with the Green Party: who wants to build on urban areas, in future, 20 percent of all flats have to prove more than social dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can also be found in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "the big dispute in the Town Hall is, however, Frmann:" "" "how are you looking for investors to build private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors at least 10 percent, but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as a social dwellings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new municipal housing programme that will cost millions of costs and will be financed for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem so Frmann: "there are currently no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as a few rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Linke will continue to serve hardness levels for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, Fratmann, exhort himself a disclosure of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">When the concept concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear if we get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not completely overhauled: because the approximately 1260 new homes should be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">What would you like to compare the loss of further 1300 advantageous dwellings in the period to come out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the current ties out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, in addition, apartments would have to be thought back to the prize money back again.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">To a blow, the problem would solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city, at the end of the year, at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: these are the owners, the housing companies do not want.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social dwellings in the West town again increased drastically, one removes itself from the goal of the so-called passage.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should not be a concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens should calculate that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">Group leader Holger Herlitschke writes: "a vast majority must have the CDU with the ship."</seg>
<seg id="34">Indeed, I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child will no longer go outside, but rather do you prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens at screens, was in the last decade of many complained.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is to get people from the sofa and you can get active at Pokemon Go.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning the screen was at the beginning on the TV, then on video games and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I have helped me of course on the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters, which first were created for video games in the 1990s (later there were a animation series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of populations hit the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">In other countries, the market launch in other countries has been moved to the server which overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within few days, Pokémon uses more users as a Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go with their smartphones outside, looking for Pokémons, who are pursued with a GPS and once they were found once, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">One generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that return the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch, the 35,000 user followed, the Washington Post ordered that within two days following the market launch of the game, the number of people who followed every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data for auction.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns to take about 30 minutes "to come" from the sofa, "and" every day to be active "shooting down in ears, because many public messages are boring in health and people come, look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the significance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances to attack cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to perform them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that people are doing something in the open, making it fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered, movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt for even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">Like always there are mürric destroyers which always have to complain about anything.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps have already been able to follow our activity earlier than Fitbit, they gave us no reason to play sports such as this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose his appeal and use the use of the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and will help many people in the hunting, more active, emitter and healthier.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present myself among the women's trial in the Tower and that out of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I've been in the summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. were never so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second: this team has three turbofans, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüterine and Madison Kocian, which is catholic, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this kind of sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the past four years, the number one was named Afro-Americans in the last four years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas became a surprising Olympic champion and the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be as she was unexpected, but most amazing gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual surplus event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but so turnaround classes did not see in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympics is only four gymnast inside the team. Moreover, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality sees so that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner first line in private gunite, which will be maintained by parents, set out for the training, installation, travel goods, competition, and hotel costs (for the trainer and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gobservers are in well-known suburbs which support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, Turner got their entire training and that is a devourful and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainee of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We must be inspired to the churches Aun innumerable, young girls who will be inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a powerful and easy access to access.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gum Foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have offered free and affordable exercises in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) offered by national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home town) in order to offer youth high-quality exercises that make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as a hard work, discipline and destination for the spirit.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long benefits for health and to school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of that team, who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the exercises and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" through the Holes of the Olympic Team Gold Medal and thank you to motivate her way to begin healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="11">People who had already a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The application design of NICE, which today has been released, recommends a 12-month-taking of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily dosage of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively increases other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options of thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British journey subcontracted his immune system and digrooted a serious testing by taking some of the most dirty and toughest locations in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and autautor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will shut up his course on a euro coin, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rushing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before extracting every object, he used an Luminometer to show and show us what he is going to be.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising result in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the rinsing pot of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely decent, but in fact there are actually more bad bacteria in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left what he ableaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intestinal by taking through the world, as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations up to molds of toilets, the task exhibited his immune system definitely under one sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health was concerned and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was devoted to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing that he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its proegistrations showed a luminaire number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminance number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refused after its luminary number above 4000 units, whereas freshly washed hands have a weight of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial counts of several sites like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this is the worst thing that I have called in a toilet, close to."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I don't hear anything here, because it is inside the inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producers of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company offers Mr. Wright with valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Validation senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at the same time, explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstormings through which we were saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is to a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how they are associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the directing of the film, added: "let me lose my respect for Ian, if he would have tasted some of things I have instructed to him, like the ecliptic Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there was things where it was easier to bring Ian, to make them groove, and others where this was quite hard.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we have recorded some of these dirty beech trees on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed rebate bacteria, especially with the well-being of gastrointestinal bacteria and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed of speed, with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to mist.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a superb team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south on the weekend, until the end of October it is expected to be completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The contrary is also the opposite of the construction works, for example, if it goes to the facility of housing drives.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site taken on Monday to the South, and even the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was abolished and thus the connection to Rottenburg was relaxed, the traffic situation inside the place has relaxes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now leave Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Transport to return through the place seems to be back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there are partially significant complaints," says the general manager of the refurbishment of the refurbishment of the general manager of Florian King.</seg>
<seg id="13">The local residents of Bachar Road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many slighters sought and rather to their Navi confided as the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to that lack of truck was engaged in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because the speed limiting cannot be stopped, the municipality strengthened the measuring car from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant surges," says King, who made itself well over the location.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg is now open the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen do not hesitate to look in the cards.</seg>

<seg id="29">Not only him, but all hosts I met it "hard."</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy could have been reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government President Jörg Schmidt on an enquiry of Göhner could give it a financial compensation otherwise by the advantages of the location on the B 27. now they also have the disadvantages to bear the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows of other counties, where something generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">During all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">So that other guests can now know less frequently due to the complicated traffic governance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you do not drive, it is also what beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner does not return any doubts after the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of crises with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner keeps the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the largest crisis that has experienced its food site in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="25">And in some point - in the unequal treatment of Gedser, for example - the question arises: what does it actually do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it's important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be found in offsetting that the terrorist attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, China is the second most important market, sales amounted to 14 percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany, deliveries of deliveries are almost one Sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brand-CEO Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker numbers from July, mainly on two sale days less in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="18">In this period, 1.3 percent more vehicles sold in this period, around 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had manipulated with a software gas tests.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW, the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.</seg>

<seg id="23">The vehicle branch office supplies the customer according to the retrofitting a "guarantee" certificate, but not from a "guarantee," as it was called on Friday in business.</seg>

<seg id="29">"deviations of these are not accepted," stated Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has adopted the guarantee that at fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, or engine output, after retrofitting, no deterioration and all type approval of the car will remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not how it was called in business.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "guarantee" Volkswagen provides the possibility of having a half year after retrofitting for example with a engine damage in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in the customer interests, it is important to avoid that there is no other damage caused by etchaiding to do nothing with the abgasskandal, as it was meant.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination panels: who are actually buying sound plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love sheets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you make the comment part in order to overdosed him under the pseudonym-Nonaggerm-age with harsh interests, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Youthv the complex recovery of sound plates do not want to achieve a boom in millennials, who would like to welcome the rety of physical objects, but on Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is not a horror by hobbyists - it has a emotional significance: older record players remain your feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of Youthv?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was an news report on TV, I would follow me the camera, while I carry out a modest street in Soho, a humble suit and wild, before I stand, hold my hands and something serious, just as: "so let's let us take a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's let us throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly entering its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now complete the buildings where the formerly independent Seller are located - is there as a handful of a handful record contract.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would ask the camera permission to switch the camera to the next part, where I stand in close proximity to several men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind due to observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data: two young women, three men middle old age) into Reckless Records (data: eight men middle age, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sound plates, shown above (it has sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't have followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy boards that he could not afford to buy themselves and buy items which he sold, when he was young and plea.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are of the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably too young to buy it," says he.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is true that those who purchase slabs, rather release and gladly spend time to spend time, and adds: "I smoke not and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who are hits to the Youthv-Profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people, who are affected by the Mediafpe, people who have heard about the comeback and imagine to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the talks, which I have led, people usually have defended up their collection as early as 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers that sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy themselves their records, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of Appendices of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the innate emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes some seconds in a business like phonica in order to detect that record business offers a soothing community of equations.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers assumped to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw the stability of familiar silencers, from objects that queue the happier periods.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void, or the ownership of your possession, as a kind of comfort," says Weber.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it is so many people so.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" not soldered a staff from a stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM revealed in April, that almost 50% of people who have bought a plate over the last month, they haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player they never use it, while 7% are those who buy a plate, no record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the message report, I would probably look very careful, while working with a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (number of people: three men aged aged) has notices a "trophy" of the revival. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone has recently been clean and said:" "" "I don't know a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead Schallplatte, so I can put it into shelf" "", "says he." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happened.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicians.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, no older who only come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has an audible audience, as I go clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts as the latest synthesis and sextet Pop instead of experimental speakers from speakers - is it good to see such diliity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but fixed psychic traumata are difficult to conceivable if you stand up for 30 seconds in addition.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and sees the variation of the available records.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a mannequin bumper as a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, therefore, it's no real option, says she.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of slabs is... "it drives with a sigh sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, of which it is said that a new generation of record boards is to have inspired: urban outams.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the ticket to the jeans-Hotpants, I observe a group of young people who group cares for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter is superior to buy a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of platters from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential boards for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to hold them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that each attraction for those objects represent more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about themselves.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research noted that the results of Youthv agree that, at least in record shops in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record players exist in reality, turntables and online forums are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are possibly working at school or office in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not surrounded by plate business of Berwick Street and the leaves through slabs, while at the starring view of an infurious, 30-year old Moderator to abstain from middle age over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a hearing of this week, the authorities argued that the state should be competent to sell 72 temporary businesses within the camp's goods, sale, hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places would be overthrown, because they would represent a parallel economy, that no tax would be paid out of which no tax would be paid and the risk of fire and sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that stores and restaurants are important, as the free meals provided by the state-supported association and other groups, do not offer sufficient food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need to offer.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there were no legal basis for the expulsion of people who had to operate 72 temporary businesses, however, that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "could be completely retraceable."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that the food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role as merely people to feed the "in extremely preventative conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by defeats was the jungle Book Kids' Café in the camp, which is charitable and with 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultancy regarding asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors in stock.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was that the closure "for these children were a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two auxiliary organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of Migrants estimates that the number of people in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - according to a steep increase of newcomings in the summer of summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at 7-time Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated at a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji granted a master class in the handling, side stepping, aftermosquitoes, liner operation and raw power to win gold - her first Olympian waist of every color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was disputed by the non-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - British Britain in this day - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in the shape of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it's probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult road behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost under Ryan each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This canopy will be weary, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful, and ordered the attacks by GBS from Spass.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell an and Co., when the World Series winner would run 5-0 to the top, when Osea Colinisau passed over the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of game play Jerry Tuwai, Jerry Tuwai, added another attack from the right corner that he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly believe the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hamper Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to get a third gate, but it has stopped Fiji only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner had a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa, added a new since the re-fiff, and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou tapped through further weak Tackling of GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion carried a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji, who was born to play 7, while GB are still relevant.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time through and lock the fijianic gap... for the whole four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova went through to a Brilliant Stop play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton took a trial for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already long in favour of the southern Indian, whose fans were pliers and dancing at the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the gaming approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fidelta slipped, the Fijis reimpoverished and GB, and they were beaten up in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Formerly on the day Fiji Japan defeated a semi-final with 20-5 defeated and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive footed and achieved a gate among the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliantly late factoring of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of English 15-Aside teams, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotional gold than for those games and that wants to be a hot gold.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard Hieve I found in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainers Robin Williams, was present at present as they changed to the second Olympian old in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, which laid a scale of such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, all of you have 39.ter unwilling, which is also an exemplary.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliants Athletes, which reflects the surface with the elegance of the elegance, reflecting not the nature of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the rowing machine there is a battalion of content to contribute to the incremental progress, which make the difference and it was no more beneficial than the trainer that would not survive this day at all, when it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, was able to have the interruption to a minimum, if this is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was at the hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it a larger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the absence of winning their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nervous morning with a little bit more than otherwise, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">To see when the centurion of the Royal Artillery Regiment was in use in Afghanistan, "I was a emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated that how much I mean, how much I and Helen and I have worked Robin.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you for him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to start up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It's really important to take away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we didn't make something to do something tolles.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to do this today no fireworks, we wanted to get a good result, going out and win the race what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions regarding its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Darshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now they just want to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">It took about six months in London to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all that new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here it took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">This feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="5">Therefore we observe the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Idylund Movement" is a group of group roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">It spends against "Multiculti-Wahn," uncontrolled mass migration, "and" loss of own identity by overforeign affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional protected in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the "Idylates" already.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said, his authority has worked closely with the offices.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'Idylary movement' are trying to pick up their target group, where it stands," said the constitutional leader.</seg>
<seg id="11">Generally, extremists try to arrange them with youthful language, often with poppy music.</seg>

<seg id="21">The decisive factor is that such people contributed to the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the clear increase of motions and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maate, he would not yet talk about new terrorism.</seg>

<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It can be quite good that further timicist groupings or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee camps or attacks from other legal circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of Justrorism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The groups were originated at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Concerned Maate about that many considerations went to the account of people who had not stepped in the right scene in advance.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the aroused aroused.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the facts on attacks on asylum are not known as crime, politically motivated offenders or followers of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">So many people have committed criminal offences, who had nothing to do with right-sexist, who might have politically indifferent, or for example, CDU, SPD or Linke, who, however, have become radicalised with the legitimate mood. "</seg>

<seg id="4">You can be converted into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein paintings.</seg>

<seg id="10">The news and their indignation were disseminated on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and motherboard, a day after Snapchat, that it would have been deactivated.</seg>

<seg id="23">Zhu criticized those of the large part of white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # Deleteer chat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either, they have no several representation of people with other skin colors in their employees, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they are safe or feel good to say what about it."</seg>

<seg id="1">In the heart of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are too late, the Olympic Games are too late.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and insofar, a rapid relay-run between competition and competitions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is more than the Olympic torch itself is an ignant staff, which turns off from the bracelet for the event to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to the TV, read a newspaper or when talking about your neighbors in the coffee shop, without talking about Simone Biles, Katie Leapy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of black with dimples, have had quite well known among these known names that were sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-being-being TV advertising, if he would have a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade the sports species that are not generally acknowledged: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I like a modest arguments for my particular Liebling, then you leave the attention to the discrete charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, it was the last 16 years that many which I had asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympian portart.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional Ignoance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, it never won a medal in the trampolines, until 2012 had an athlete, who made it to Endrunde.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tends to divide the prices for both the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong in China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampolintro jump a certain outer side charme, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear for a clownsschool as the sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this place, I should admit that I am no expert, but only a bundled enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorously potential - the cartographic trembling of his never to end up - but also the grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports, which combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means a lot of" "" "dive board" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Slow start jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hugly and salad) before they stood at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympics article, you will be evaluated for degree, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-ranking athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vektor is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go on top of gold after gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, down and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not just hunt the finish line or the output wall, but in the TV broadcast also another minor goal: the world or the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented streches is Nobel, admired, even fanatic and it's enough to beat a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself playing for watching these games as a little fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an open house.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prenties, seemingly heavier and like a astronaut, go to the top, then effortlessly back to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, just the dreamy, elegant period of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is so Zen as the contest for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final friends of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will grind the final round as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a calm, nice moment, one who will probably see in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness can only be reached through the attaching and the objectivity of male athletes - like the male U.S. Turner first proposed to the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his after air-ring, new fattendding.</seg>

<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid composite of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government had shook the country and increased steadily to more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and the required fundamental political changes.</seg>

<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous land of Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services collaborates closely with Ethiopians, to fight terrorists on the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopians economy expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has been drastically improved - there is a new endendpoint in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are normally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was more than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to continue the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, dissidents were dissidents effective to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were put into exile or put into prison, or put them into the wilderness of the wilderness.</seg>

<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering all from the floor up to the seasoning with regard to power of the regimes of the regimes.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the stresses climb along the border to Eritrea; a fight for these jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Surveyor fears that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden the turbulences have exploded over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Explain several factors, why feelings of failure after years is exploded under the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopian people were able to communicate through the social media, because cheaper smartphones have been more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are at regular intervals, especially at protests, do many people still communicate over Internet-proxies that conceal where they stop themselves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Eons the Amharas, which come from Ethopia, predominantly in Christian redeveloping countries, in the politics and the economy, while she exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated right by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population, and the military, in the secret services, in the trade and politics are dominant.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-public disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered the tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that it was especially promised to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers to edit opponents and make it harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing on that fundamentally," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict of conflict.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopians, new prime minister, Hailemariam Desallegn, was selected from relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Another than Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray in northern Arabia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts predict that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fears that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was one of such uproar, in 2005, after thousands against elections protesters the government had to pledge from the government and then stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raid, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of the disturbances went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts encouraged Ethiopian leaders for its visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new pendoscope, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this does not have the intensification of the internal abitation of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she takes a dangerous ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesting in Gondar, an amharsh city, by Tigray guided shops and the hatred opposite the Tigray is still practised in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say the protests in the USA and other Western Allies in an independent position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, even if she had recently decided this basis has closed this basis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest spine is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland. usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return on board the research ship Sanna into the sea after an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is floating with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland about 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the Greenland expedition along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is just 1.220 meters away.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it occurs, it accelerates the five meters long animal to a gradient of 2,6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This from long-loneliness lifestyle seems to be a godfather for a tall age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal Science "in any case from Greenland, the 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "he commented on Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland become stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lack the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe and finally live in the ice-sea front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they had water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the lifestyle of Greenland, researchers know very little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their period of time they emptied six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nonetheless, this sharks make this sharks: on the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had shaded the jaw of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly hunt them asleep animals or patrol on the ground of the polar seas and looking for cadaver which swings from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland's, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 is size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises from the birth of the sharks, which contained therein no more.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when atomic tests had increased major amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">At 220 centimetres in the length of the smallest animal, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from atomic bombs, it should be celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens abnormalities, all larger carbon-14 amounts found in the atmosphere by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock was actually shown for a 493 centimetre long Greenland angle at 335 years, while the record shark could be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Greenland-females only got offspring, if they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Well, researchers of the length could be assigned to age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably aimed at the threshold for sexually mature and its age at 156 years was determined, Greenland's sharks will be at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also that should be world record for vertebrates at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland expedition, penetrated a 120 year old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through low temperatures frequently the organism of the living animals live on savings of savings.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and at slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often are particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal is heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal is therefore dangerous and should focus on it as soon as possible as many offspring as possible," "" "says the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerlein as soon as possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should invest its resources in a long life over it.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the role of the anchorman Sir Chris Hoy who had made his estate and proudly made the legend, when he stormed into the house to get a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago England claimed a shocking win while Hoy fetched the fifth of six Olympiagoldmedaillen.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick, after they held in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys just a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did it in time as a hind.</seg>
<seg id="8">Planys, a gap produced by Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they remained, when they saw the potential in the Scots that now unfold.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner set up a Olympiarship in the qualifying rounds, but in the standstill wounds the New Zealand also prevailed in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">He turned almost back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy of strategy made a large part of transformation, with the execution in a higher gear to slow it down and tell them, and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC-expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they came to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We put a olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are no better way to win.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side Kennys and Hoys gave him a weak start to the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He drew this statement later and there was no objections of English Rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">He said: "it feels like London's entire GB flagship to the grandstand as London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We are so bad in so many world titels so bad that it was incredible again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, who won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing as well as in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that a cash flow of our progress has been in the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>

<seg id="29">It was born for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sport; at the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister was born) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">The beetest of Hoy is the same.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will start over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team-event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels something unique to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">He said, "When he gains two more gold medals, he should be beaten for the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was another good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brake Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 on the finish line.</seg>
<seg id="40">The record, who won gold in London in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the Rower, while the Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he was fighting with the qualification before the qualification, when the officials were calling for him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women competition, which continued tomorrow and ended, avancated Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is leaving behind his strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and collect a sar in medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It was playing drums in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst sexes and Mobbingsis and the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you see the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks pretty thereafter, as the legendary reputation of GBS that has reached its peak at the perfect moment.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather bulky.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was at the beginning eight megabytes, that would be enough for approximately two lighters with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be reached by creating new possibilities for ortsentious and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local congregations there are already 10,000 new apprentices, 40,000 new jobs will create jobs and youth unemployment at the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead for us in London 2012, there will be such that the challenge of extension Heathrow is too big.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was told me that England will never be ready for the games and we will be blaminate for us on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2012 the bians had injustice and they are also wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers to answer any one.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">The expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in humorous growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs to leave the airport as well as in GB.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which was a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program that was elected by the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two frequencies from the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to supply a third running steer, which is supported by £16 billion to private investments.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I'm confident that the Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model probably habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA has developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble them of climate researches.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once danced with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 tight atmosphere once ensimilar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously noted that the slow circulation of Venus could be declared by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin, erdlike atmosphere, and slowly continue to move slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model lighted the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet thought to have probably more dry regions than the earth, but had once enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited from a sun that matter 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS-model simulation, the slow circulation of Venus is nearly two months long," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a rainy, in order to reduce the surface of the bulk of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model presented a history of the Venus that was similar to evolution that had previously assumed by Planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was formerly known to be inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years, was exposed to heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its oceans are evaporated and vapour of water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their Hydrogen discharged only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid willingly to the perpetrators required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are specialized in accordance with the observations of Malwarebytes and fixing into corporate networks, according to the observations of Malwarebytes.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially limiting ransom is significantly higher than with private use.</seg>

<seg id="9">In 2008, most painters were still designed to send advertising to advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the Daily Alpressing software discovered for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private use was the goal, but the change to company attacking was frightening in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once upon the computer of a sacrifice, it is searching for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archive of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files are encrypted with Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software introduces the requirements of the compressors.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to get files, the victims must assign money - usually in the form of Crypmalnutrition Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But wherever private use the personal photo database on the game stands, it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without leaving the production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is due to damage when a Ransomware hit.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies had reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent had to stop the activities completely, in case of cases were people in Fatal.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say to the victims": pay not, you only promotes this problem, "says Kobzynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to remove the demand of the perpetrators in the operation of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researcher from F-Secure examines the user areas and the contact with the expresses, and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to rebuild a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set free support sites or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they will be punished according to payments of a few hundreds of euros, companies must pay part hard negotiating and five-digit sums to get their data unturnkey.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potential high and relative risks of the Ransomware refund the hackers are always professional and split the work, explains the security specialists Chester Wisniewski, by Internet-vendor SOPHOS: "a single person can write about within a week."</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V was rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, there is no place closely.</seg>

<seg id="10">The boot space can be loaded well, however, the height of the charger with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l-Diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you can be rolled up for ever, at night you wake up hours. in the morning you don't forget to think of sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep problems and more than ten percent are often found out of sleep or permanently relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are among them many causes are underlying, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Sleep Fasting and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you look forward among them, but is the Insomnie, so I have an input and asleep sound.</seg>
<seg id="8">Straight, many people are going to sleep as harmless or inadequate, as Jens Wagons, member of the German house medical association with medical practice in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleeping troubles?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychic or behaviour-related factors can also take medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Unseldom is the sleep disturbing expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is common primarily with depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that various factors need to go to one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who has a herniated disc can be poorly, wakes up all two to three hours and starts womensable to greet about everyday problems and to greet, Weeß is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when do you deal with sleep disturbance to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week and impaired on the day should be doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The influence can look completely different: it is struck, tired, unfolding, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical problems like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disturbance, it is essential to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options include behavioural changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medications - classic bedtablets only in the exceptional case and the maximum for two weeks - inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there are hardly underlines of living-mediaesthesia in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the Interdisciplinary Research Centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore one should consult with sleeping difficulties first at the doctor, Weß Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarify if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleeping laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">To study in the sleep laboratory, physician, for example, in case of snapshot with breathability to sleep during sleep or if you do not find the cause of asleep sound.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just please do not have lunch," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wired, one goes to the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body one carries a nose-brille, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">Furthermore, a camera stands on the blanket of the sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people affected the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are rather many positions to which one can set for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular bed- and rise times, not too long in bed, in the day not sleep, not television to sleep, alcohol, and at night not at the watch - then you start instantly up, and that's all and absolutely not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="5">Article about this trendy district, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls in the last weeks, however, prefers with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts located on the ground floor are yet occupied spaces and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, since the beginning of the year, right for a hard drive of the police against the project, the area known as "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June, the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, were patrol three weeks from official statements, with 30 to 40 civil servants and three club car on site, locked parts of the road, and held visitors to the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, identical construction workers on behalf of the unknown household owners offered the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin administration decided that the clearance was illegal and one day later, police and construction workers under the Jewish of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents go with children, people sit on the brush in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the skin projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main orge of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the area since 1999, and Jana *, which has been attracting three children, especially from the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the skin projects, they divide the care before increasing and gentlemons.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound according to a pine, who wish to wish to arrange a majority of police protection from vandalating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior and the police turn up between squatting and their neighbours, obviously not exists.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin actually was a traditional labour quarter, which is even today compared to the rest of the city a lower average and high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">The occupied housing projects and the resulting residential projects are already long to the area: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire mainz street, close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under large police force, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer, and are partly inhabited by people, who had occupied them from 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the quarter in the past years has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and electoral liners from around the world: with them now, people from GDR-times and former house occupied their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can also be felt in the rent which has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuilds on the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them from the raised discs or freshly damaged facades that were discarded with color damage.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year as often as "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for that, not all neighbours must be regarded as a problem, that they are not necessarily affected by the crime, according to criminal offences, according to terrorism, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offenders make damage to newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, no speech may be no speech.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence acts, is it crucial: people in the 94 are their neighbors who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars can be delivered directly to the Rigaer for longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied Architecin is not a criminal fuel point, on the contrary: "here you can find one another, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than what else."</seg>
<seg id="30">In Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the people resides their road: from the police, politics and the media, who came in in July all of the Deutory understanding over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer will continue to move away: by provoking newly built new buildings in former buildings that forceases the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are the condominiums that are not interesting here for many people - here are people who are not so well," "" "says she." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I do absolutely not look."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if someone does not hear anything?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration in all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the trailed, the sticky bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the pines.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who goes on, should be aware of it - just like anyone who attracts himself in a Kneipense, there can be poorly complain about noise in there.</seg>

<seg id="4">In July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social pedagogical support the team of management by Achim Grow berger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities, and who else was missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">REGINE client from working groups indicates that the honorary citizen is more thankful, that Deuvert is now there, the eager heatchsau which is especially a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spottingly than rather than the multitude of what would require, in fact, when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We sought a management team with a talent for languages and people, connected to a long-standing experience in the field of social work.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration is not its central area, Annika Deuverle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, we go to organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with it for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has a 50 percent job on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that Annika Englishle honors and capitals are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small issues, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the dairy street</seg>
<seg id="17">Since some time, there has been a serious problem for some time units that have been recognized for the connecting tours that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection of the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accept the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must wear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from Landratchet to Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far did it not work, you have been prompted to private apartments, so Deuvert.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, non-binding dwellings must be deemed necessary as it is so fair.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon as soon as soon as new containers are installed in the washer street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Englishle embrace.</seg>
<seg id="30">Apart from a permanent stay there are trainees, training places, training courses, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants who have to be greed or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help, non-profit charitable work - and that motivates how Annika Englishle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is hoping to ensure that the work leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">That is not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day require a solid structure, say goodle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a seniority.</seg>
<seg id="38">So do offers offers such as sport, contacts with local and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can skip your board and honorary citizens.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they welcome them in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it only takes to make them meaningfully with them, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever wants to feel the feeling that he could not work in Urbach there may not work, neither be unprofitable, who would never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The significant majority be motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problems also, however, says the customer honestly, "people, where nothing goes to." the work of Deuvert and the customer is therefore always too motivating others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "Mammalogger" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they both have become afraid of radicalization in front of radicalization, even in a small village like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer very clearly," "" "what mancher might call naiv." "" "there is a residual risk and don't want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensizing be the helpers already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They are worried that the attacks carried them completely in obituaries.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they are nothing to do," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honour of guests must be met on site and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the background, they are always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants might come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there, where we want to go," says Annika Englishle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">REGINE Client also makes clear that the Urbacher has already been appropriate to integrate existing people reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women are single.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no simple answers.</seg>
