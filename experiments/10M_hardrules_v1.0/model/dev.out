to have shot his gir@@ l@@ friend , Professor , His gir@@ l@@ friend
in a emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon told you with a loud voice of the police , that he shot his gir@@ l@@ friend and would have to come to his house .
by reason it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably wake up , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house , the civil servants of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was critic@@ ized on a white block , I loved A@@ my and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to information by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no reference to that , who had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , he had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where he has shot a popular history teacher , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed .

he said that he sometimes had the fat@@ eful emergency call sometime after it .
by the end of the day there was another death : he took the life , when the police arrested him .
a day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of it , which suff@@ ice .
those published by investig@@ ators to the two ends of the state published details , such as students and staff who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but probably difficult to draw .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where he died , did not have a history of violence or a criminal record .
in one of his written book , Schmidt was mentioned , in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; mentioned in whom he shared his academic life .
both trained in the department for social sciences and history , whose teachers included 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ asts , the Lamb lob@@ b@@ ed , said that he seemed to be a little bit excited and nerv@@ ous , &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
in addition , the Delta State University had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had no problem for health reasons .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university was significant that the promotion , for which a hard work had produced so hard for him to obtain a automatic way for an automatic way to an assistant as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knows nothing from the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs screening . &quot;
these are any questions that can not answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs gauge , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ sas on his journey .
before he was arrested , self @-@ killing myself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of its parent &apos;s house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Ro@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran into the drive .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson told that he knew that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , he began work at the university , covering 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants , and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he received his doctorate in Spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of sl@@ bs called him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met by joint friends .
they and their friends were in the High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to bring their guitar play .
he was the black pearls &apos; at that time .
all the girls at that time he was there , &quot; H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 , and in the Jackson city of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ab@@ un were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick house where he ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you at G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am , said they were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am on his daughter .
she and her mother were absolute best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am he said he never met , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues .
he met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met three years ago on a summer fair market three years ago .
later they played together one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am said he writes his daughter and s@@ ings her own music .

there was no indication for anything that was not right .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were at the cleaning and tired .
I mean , they had both a good sense of sh@@ ear .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was notable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were waiting for the roy@@ als , and I perc@@ eive that the seat is empty next to me , and it will be certain that Princess Diana will sit in front of me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to me in my mind that I am a simul@@ ated c@@ rows and a arm length from it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date .

UN Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says , his reply to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will become ir@@ relevant for millions of people .
the UN leader calls upon all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to join and integ@@ rative negotiations to fin@@ ing a political solution .
ban on a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet foreign minister of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain , and France - at the edge of the general meeting of the General Assembly , in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
he was sorry that the dra@@ fts in the Council and the Syrian People and Regional powers can not make this situation dis@@ sol@@ uble . &quot;
ban called for the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity of the crisis in Syria by demonstr@@ ating a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Qu@@ ery values , showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken .
some have tried to fire him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to move a Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper push back to change , it doesn &apos;t work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys show Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask of what it means for the od@@ ds of the properties of property Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is too early in the election period .
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump will win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys were asked to join the rising Herman Cain , of which nobody won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have in a general election .
but external groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps through stamina and start to run their dollar to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some recent survey figures that indicate that the property Mog@@ ul isn &apos;t just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ on@@ ur in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University found that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate mo@@ g@@ um .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac system in I@@ owa has seen last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with the for@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; dis@@ fre@@ t &quot; if he was the candidate .
only Ben @-@ Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about the pump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio is with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters think that they &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; conf@@ is@@ fied &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate .
a majority of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans see Tr@@ um@@ ps Tem@@ p not as a problem .
during the Donald Tr@@ ump , a journalist critic@@ ized for his journ@@ alistic and inten@@ sely att@@ acking claims that the property Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first paragraph state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
however , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of 10 un@@ dependent shows that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House P@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
when they apply their money care , Republi@@ can voters guard Tr@@ ump to real .
when asked if they are being asked who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten had set their money in J@@ eb Bush from the end of July .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not the clear crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans perceived that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination by only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a wide range of GO@@ P voters will view tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as a pl@@ au@@ sible .
even when the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans settled around another candidates , Tr@@ ump strikes yet almost every one .
some experts believe that the sh@@ atter@@ ed field may likely to work with tr@@ um@@ ps lead , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread over a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ on @-@ head race between the tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump the majority support .
he was 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , especially Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Kas@@ ich , and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ thet@@ ical head @-@ championship race .
a big majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans speak that they formed their opinion .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only more than half the voters want to support the g@@ ump , say that they have set up their voices .
of course , there can do a lot to change that , and no one can really tell you ever .
46 percent said they will leave the door to change to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree to immig@@ ration in the subject of immig@@ ration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , some months immig@@ rants from Mexico called &quot; rape &quot; was the immig@@ ration and a met@@ ering event in the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the latest bast@@ ions are compar@@ atively til@@ ted by the decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ American from the Republi@@ can Party and is dam@@ aging the new ori@@ enting efforts .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they co@@ inci@@ de with a g@@ ump in questions of immig@@ ration .
as long as immig@@ ration stays in the spotlight , a Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ stration concerning the government climbed to new high@@ s .
in Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben @-@ Car@@ son , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters falls , mostly through their Foreign @-@ wing status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they would prefer to use a political role as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry against Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago showed that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; in@@ satisfied , and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ king trail there is the most expensive home residential community with a view over the North Sea .
the road takes a square meter for a home wall on average 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt we have limited the offer of objects in nature , &quot; says it &apos;s in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows which total layers per square meter will cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student card in Munich are not really a little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ residential buildings , one of the price will be as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Service Engel &amp; Ful@@ ler published a leaderboard for the exclusive German residential sites - with square @-@ size prices in gr@@ ass@@ essing heights .
since there are several ten thousand Euros in one square meter , a well @-@ noticed .
but good that can aff@@ ord it ...
by the way : Munich is just as an exception here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to H@@ eller and Go@@ dd@@ ess
double go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pir@@ ro : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller is simply a barrel .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller delivered the way to FC Bayern with a score of 3 : 0 at olymp@@ ic pir@@ ate - then ran it .
a sover@@ eign start to the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have described a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milano &quot; by the FC Bayern in War@@ eh@@ essel .
the team of trainer P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola has won their kick @-@ off match in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in h@@ ott@@ est atmosphere thanks to gar@@ bage &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race @-@ success in series is to be the first step towards final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally get up the stern expedition to Munich .
he received his 28th matches in the Champions League for the Bavaria @-@ leading heavy relief of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto who led an thought to pass through the world champion in the Champions League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium prior to 31.@@ 6@@ 88 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Munich @-@ based word &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they demonstrated a concentrated and eng@@ aging performance , without swe@@ ating .
Pir@@ ro had won his most recent six home games in the roy@@ alty , including famous clubs like Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here .
however , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ ellen were defeated with Greek teams , but didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they went very cour@@ te@@ ous to participate in her reve@@ aling efforts , but often to find works .
the attacks were led to the outside attack on Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , who came in rare against the previous German @-@ silence Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ aou@@ i rarely .
Müller had more luck left than his fl@@ ank from the right half field on the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion scored the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Yam@@ ye Brown presented the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26th ) .
then by direct connection , the go@@ al@@ keeper enjoyed Roberto with the kne@@ el ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bayern dominated its warm play , pir@@ ate was able to place pir@@ ate con@@ i@@ fers .
but Manuel New was refer@@ enced in Tor@@ hil@@ ly Manuel New .
thus , when he de@@ fle@@ cted a shot of ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that worked fine .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat at first outside .
the World Cup - there was only light green light only after the ending @-@ green light , &quot; said Sport@@ chief Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; those who want to do something else , this is true . &quot;
also at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he had brought his King@@ sley Com@@ an for his convic@@ ts Lev@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Mu@@ eller still set a dr@@ on .
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partial tran@@ ss@@ ing Bayern fans in their audience @-@ block , the supporters of H@@ ous@@ eus seized his words and G@@ ath@@ est prov@@ oked , attacked the security forces and went with head@@ winds against the Munich supporters .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , it is not only the lung , but also the teeth - that sets out a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk is rapidly sin@@ c@@ rate .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this goes from the long @-@ term study of an international researcher teams , including several of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , smoking was the risk of loos@@ ing their teeth less than 2.5 to 3.6 times higher .
more than 23,@@ 300 participants were observed .
the main causes of teeth fall as@@ ies and inflamm@@ ations of the g@@ um , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these par@@ o@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and g@@ low loss is therefore back on common g@@ ums in smo@@ kers .
don &apos;t be resolved what you have increased the risk for car@@ ies too .
people who list@@ ened to smoking , could reduce their risk from short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; within a short period of time .
however , it could continue for more than ten years until the haz@@ ards return to the level of non @-@ smoking property , the first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
they had to convince people of it , non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained the cur@@ ator of H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and leads to our in@@ sights as well as to a good tooth health until the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are afflicted by Z@@ ah@@ os@@ mot@@ ely , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed over 20 percent of the population .
previous studies have already noted that smoking will raise the risk for early tooth fl@@ aring .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ divi@@ des the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late anti@@ quity

the EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over the TT@@ IP
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current financial system by the European Commission via the proposed trans@@ atl@@ antic free trade agreement for TT@@ IP .
the controversi@@ al private cas@@ ual equipment for any disp@@ utes between the companies and the states must therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to clearly more traditional dishes in its function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want a system to trust the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ miss@@ ile Cec@@ ilia Office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ des must bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade discussions with the USA .
the German government announced support .
the largest free trade zone in the world will result in 800 million people by TT@@ IP .
according to the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings , the EU states and the United States will jointly select an independent judge for a new investment plan .
they should come from the EU , the US and third @-@ country states .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow me to raise up against Ur@@ als obj@@ ections .
so far , the process involved in arbit@@ rators , to date , did not have a formal opportunity against their sentences .
in the discussion of the past months , the citizens of the old IS@@ DS system has failed in terms of fair fair@@ ness and justice , commented .
in the long term , they will continue to work according to an international investment plan .
this could then be clari@@ fied between the Chinese and EU states between Chinese companies and EU countries .
most of the required investor and arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the major reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional refer@@ r@@ als are critic@@ ised as a type of parallel to the companies which extend the tax burden of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws or to cut CO2 emissions and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act includes the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) can not be dealt for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state champion Matthias Mach@@ ene ( SPD ) called for his plans , on the other hand as major progress .
the Commission entered into account with the fundamental points of the Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in the spring of other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of the U.@@ K. .

del@@ ik@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
11 years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Luxor ) .
besides him , there is a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the sh@@ y @-@ looking folder of the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized of Stev@@ ens .
he tells you from a variety of places that he always refers to the map , what about his minimal and z@@ art arranged songs reported .
where they were created , and how it looks , in his home .
since then , Stev@@ ens has been able to re@@ discover more than wonderful creative ones .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear to appear harmon@@ ically very close to U.S. folk folk music of the late six@@ ties but at any time you can drift away .
rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a ver@@ gen@@ ic series : everyone of the 50 US states should be reviewed in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the proximity &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and there is positive expectations .
this reduces the Stev@@ ens here .
live with him guitar and Ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician returns to New York &apos;s living musicians .

persu@@ asion of ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic features .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any yearly chart on the most influ@@ ential music media .
following exceedingly productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic offset pieces .
this sixth regular studio album is still very wide orchest@@ rated , but of programmed sequences or be@@ ats and plays with all the effect and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller club , the stage shows are here at the colorful spect@@ acle on ne@@ on Stir@@ ling belts and large fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band from Germany .

Theater presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; since March , which is available since March .
although almost 2000 guests are banned in their chairs , the pl@@ ain@@ ly sensitive Stev@@ ens comes back to in@@ tim@@ acy and for folk .
without a word to the audience , the group is playing excellent musicians a wide @-@ enriched album .
one stop from the audience : the talk is &quot; op@@ ul@@ enter &quot; and one could possibly throw the &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since its election Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s has been working with tension at the Prime Minister &apos;s performance .
the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s issues and to join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be lifted up to noon in order to expos@@ e the first of his six pre@@ defined questions to mid@@ day , whereby his power is likely to be checked out of the media and the Labour MEP .
he called &quot; less Theatre and more facts &quot; on this weekly event .
he said also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to transfer her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary audit for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , since it comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett and following his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the ruling of the Labour leader , on Tuesday during the occasion of the occasion of the national an@@ them at a ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes the criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MP@@ S , and stands in the centre of several tit@@ le@@ faces @-@ stories in the newspapers .
M@@ R Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has caught attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have had &quot; in respec@@ t@@ ful silence , &quot; and he said the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle to England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ atten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of its belief that the mon@@ archy is to be abolished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to minister in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s top team , and she is committed to differences in business , defence and foreign policy , while less than one Six@@ th of the Parliamentary Party , it was originally supported as leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements were also soci@@ ally st@@ alled in Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s post@@ ings , to the European Union and the limit of profits .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour Party do pre @-@ put to remove all the idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pen@@ sions ministers decided that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the g@@ overning plans to lower the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 in £ 23@@ ,000 .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , who became David Cameron since he became a member of the Dis@@ patch cabinet during the last decade over the Dis@@ patch cabinet .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy attachment , says that he has given &quot; crow@@ ds @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the reconstruction of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally , and that he will have both &quot; impact strength &quot; and the battle with resistance to cease . instead , he has made serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
M@@ R Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of business , is represented at him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example , when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea to the conversation , that other colleagues fail to take the word , and that he spoke John Ber@@ tha , the spokes@@ man of the room , spoke to the problem .
when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he would remove from the politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ ual fel@@ ine &quot; and often associated with the Docum@@ entation of the Prime Minister . however , some years later he pointed out that he failed .
since it was first sent to television in 1990 , the questionnaire was considered the most important Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and its position among his parliamentary group , although Crit@@ ics argu@@ ed , she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and a lot of re@@ forms .

that percentage had been the fastest and replaced ass@@ ess@@ ments over the time of a interest in interest .
the pound increased by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump from 20 % after the acquisition of the Ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v .

the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter C@@ ow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it may be un@@ likely that this purchasing power would be the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

Met@@ Cash starts the campaign against mit@@ igation against Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ a tries to protect the IG@@ A branches from a Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ whol@@ es@@ aler has started a trap campaign in order to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , strengthen your relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ tra@@ ders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as E@@ ish@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in IG@@ A stores samples and shop @-@ owner who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league to faithful customers .
it is expected that the cash and further details of its defense strategy will be published on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers of food , alcohol and devices through their annual investors will pass through .
it is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ stores and generate greater profit margin as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern countries .
proc@@ urement in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ic provincial market and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern engineering .
however , an@@ alysts predi@@ ct such Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries will gra@@ b and take care of all existing members , but mainly that individual retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley published that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million sales per year and cash to $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and a turnover of $ 500 million in each market .
the loss in food and grocery and at large quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed base could cost met@@ cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , metabol@@ ised market shares in the East @-@ states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the best men .
Morgan Stanley is participating in the food and market market at 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , was after a business year in Melbourne , that the cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
the cash key refused to react publicly on the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is assumed that a board member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ abol@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Dou@@ glass &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food retail , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflec@@ ting up 43 percent interest in operating pressure on revenues and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers , however , is investing more than $ 150 million to buy sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and provide a better selection of private label food@@ stuffs .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging program programs to be defined and hopes that the wholesale distributors go back to earnings growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis center Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserv@@ es praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserv@@ ed praise to view the President of the Australian tennis courts Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for his own behavior .
co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special KS &quot; because of the not@@ ori@@ ous argument of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters to the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati , afterwards , co@@ z@@ k@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison had to pl@@ ush Cy@@ cles , and I shou@@ ldn &apos;t beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen as he cr@@ ushed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp@@ on def@@ ended a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , coconut kin@@ ak@@ is of Heal@@ y was def@@ ended .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic , the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that I rather en@@ vi@@ ed me is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken the r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost a cr@@ ack@@ et in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has destroyed a bat of Fr@@ ust , with himself , and I know Tan@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he did feel extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly professional voc@@ ative affairs of Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserv@@ es a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I think he was treated a little too hard .
he is a very rei@@ fer 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he doesn &apos;t fit in his team and so on , he is fil@@ tering hard , it is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think it deserv@@ es it to be judged by his own secret services .
Heal@@ y also supported the decision to consider Cy@@ cles on the important preliminary ruling that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; shared decision &quot; than the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term stronger component . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is fully concentrated on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y .
and I believe that Nick has done very quickly the asc@@ ension , of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray went out . he &apos;s in the eyes of the public , but we try to think of him to understand the consequences of his business . some time outside the ramp , in which he can think that it is best for the crew and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
European refugee crisis : Hungary declared Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , which continues to return refugees
Hungary explains the emergency , and locked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held out all who tried to stop illegal in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land re@@ acted and Serbian civil servants re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
people who fled from violence , have fled for an unknown period in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the lands and built there tents in tents .
but fru@@ str@@ ations increased .
as a police helicopter on them floating , the immig@@ rants &apos; open the border ! &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian will@@ ing@@ y .
some counts of protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia explained that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ alism .
it must be held during the coming days of convers@@ ations with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the tur@@ mo@@ il of the Hungarian @-@ Serb border arrived in Brussels a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block at a controversi@@ al meeting in Brussels .
the ministers agreed not to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who have sought refuge in the over@@ crow@@ ded Italy and Greece . they afflicted their hopes that - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would have more than 120,000 refugees , including several from Hungary .
on Tuesday , Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary , however , set its hopes to a b@@ lower case of Brussels or its neigh@@ bors .
on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities gave more power to conquer the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ as said that his country has also completed the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even periods of prison was used to create the bar@@ bed wire sp@@ ell between Hungary and Serbia .
during the last months , Hungary is home to many of the war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a significant bott@@ len@@ ecks and entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming business trips are looking for a better life , and not war@@ lor@@ ds who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high gate to har@@ sh the government along the southern border in Serbia , for a crime . this law also impos@@ e higher adher@@ es for condemned human tra@@ der .
&quot; because of the situation , which was made by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency condition , &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the Southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very much : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament has to agree on the use of the military , yet to agree that for next week , but repor@@ ter from Associated Press are seen at the border severely armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on day @-@ ang .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities have caught 45 people attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were deeper into the country .
they come over by paying the fence , they are now in police custody and will be accused of off@@ ences against the new law .
the authorities are to repair the fence .
Hungarian civil servants signed two of the seven border contracts with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a pulling vehicle with bar@@ bed wire to close the limits .
chaos cancelled the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ aria opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and cr@@ ushed a crowd in order to push it out there .
around 20 succeeded in coming but thousands remained outside .
another group of immig@@ rants block the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water to travel to Hungary .
option @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s ledge ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US @-@ Secretary Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination of national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders to win her from the ground .
Clinton has now backed up 47 percent of the democratic voters during the previous elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is rising in second position , at 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced if he dict@@ ated for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters .
more than five months before the beginning of the election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ t supporters are permanent as those of the other candidates in their election .
since the C@@ BS News Report Clinton has lost a series of dem@@ ographic groups while S@@ anders had posted several prizes .
Clinton keeps a big advantage over women and moder@@ ates , but these jumps have reduced .
their support for the men has pl@@ ung@@ ed significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage of democratic voters under the age of 50 has decreased , and s@@ anders are now at the same height .
but Clinton has yet a major advantage over the older voters .
the past month was Clinton in front of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit advantage over the Liber@@ al but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead to this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections will say that they would support his enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some benefits and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support them for six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons current supporters are particularly impressed by it .
the views are al@@ bl@@ ended with those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would thr@@ illed them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters think that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters throughout their leading candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it &apos;s time is that a woman &apos;s president will be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters , its connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) will also be mentioned .
consent for the handling of problems and the elec@@ torate is also cited .
as the vice president let@@ es a potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ an office , 57 per cent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race , though a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters want to be asked for the party , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top .
by Clin@@ t trailer people say more than half that bi@@ ans would have their second choice far before S@@ anders .
the Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , will increase Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters want to see candidates a candidate with the best chances of winning choice ; however , this figure decreased by 78 per cent in the last month .
be@@ eing is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that has seen him as the &quot; selectable &quot; has increased .
however , on the question , what is important for one candidate , the Democratic Vot@@ ers call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month , a single dem@@ oc@@ rati@@ onal candidate or potential candidate for this sel@@ ections could be recognised as in@@ acceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates provide good results with some important features for elec@@ tors of the party &apos;s elec@@ toral elections .
focus on multiple Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ds as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong gui@@ ding qualities .
he cuts the lead in the three candidates , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters think that Clinton &apos;s hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
Democratic Vot@@ ers for the pres@@ election will generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , some of the democratic voters think no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clinton to use a personal e @-@ mail address and server during the term as a Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation of the aff@@ air and say that their opinions has not influenced in total .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans are not satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion of that happened in March , shortly after the problem of the light came , sp@@ itted .
most of the Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion anno@@ yed their opinion .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views are worse by Clinton .
although Clinton has watched by the voters of their party as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for it under registered voters . only 32 percent will see it as hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of voters do not hold for hon@@ est and tru@@ st@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters think not to be tru@@ thful as non @-@ hon@@ est and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes with guidance .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son , and Bush were best in honor .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather as hon@@ est , but as at Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rates for the survey sample by 351 elec@@ tors in the elec@@ toral campaign is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son back near Donald Tr@@ ump on a nation @-@ related survey
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates the half of the voters falls in the new survey , and others are going to fall dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters still support tram in great number . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey which was conducted by Fox News debate in the last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son counts between 6 % and 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son works well with dem@@ ographic groups and sur@@ passes the cl@@ ump among Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Kas@@ i , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sins Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who has fallen to the deepest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Govern@@ or J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ sas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio is located at 6 % on the third place .
the error mar@@ ge in the sample of 376 persons of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week shows that Car@@ son emerg@@ es in the surveys , with 19 % support for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
overlooking one of the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side@@ hi@@ es for former neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , even after Car@@ son decided to ap@@ ologi@@ ze mour@@ ning faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday while a campaigns in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of Baruch College new@@ com@@ ings
almost two years after a student had to perform a student at a student union at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ lament for five people will be submitted .
members of the New York &apos;s Baruch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ och joined Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introductory rit@@ r@@ als in September 2013 , and delayed its transportation to the hospital , which led to his death divided into the police .
civil servants said that he had been loaded with blin@@ king over a 30 pound back@@ pack , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go through a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally fell on head@@ ache , and then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was lost and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , such as the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to bring advice to advice , said pol@@ ishing ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members of the U@@ ten@@ sil@@ ia started to hide and presented the health of the Brotherhood fundam@@ entally by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ os@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ve revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning by his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has been repeated with dum@@ b power injury on the head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the weak@@ nesses of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
frac@@ tional ships and their members must be drawn to account , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe Reception received an indictment for murder of the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are accused of accused of har@@ sh attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to take responsible person , but if there is an organization that has - officially or un@@ officially - this will also go to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Brotherhood College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood again rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases its interest
an interest rate is coming , and the house is brought into sl@@ ender , yields top @-@ ends to bonds , and the economy is driven into recession .
we know that .
what we can not know how long will it take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy does not offer low instructions for the course of the procedure .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months .
the ag@@ gression of the Federal Reserve at an increase of interest rates is often , if it is not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank so viol@@ ates that investors should not concentrate on it when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather , on the time period required for the normal@@ ization .
in fact , several variables are playing a role .
however , at the end , market participants could determine that all the exc@@ itement could be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated due to interest rates .
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be refused by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; endor@@ sed money , &quot; by Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers .
in contrast to this we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at low level , to allow for the seism@@ ic shock that seem to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is an area of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the result of interest increases for a while .
once the increase arrives , the effect is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a trend that stake will be decl@@ ining for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps constit@@ uting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank an@@ alysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a recent study , what happened after interest increases of F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , quite flat in the 250 days after ( average profit after 500 days ) , with an average return in the past six past cycles from 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief unit strategy in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management .
Deutsche Bank predicted that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the enh@@ ancing cycle , and the return period starts to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic experience , but interest rate do they often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is con@@ fron@@ ted with some conditions that could not make it a recession and accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 tari@@ ffs increase since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few predi@@ ct that this will take over and expect it to be only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
interest increases in a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and tos@@ ses the question as if it is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year at a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were on the inaugural session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , there are just a 25 percent chance of fut@@ ures .
&quot; in our study , all increases cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in GDP has taken place and prior to the onset of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report .
in contrast to this , this is a clear recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , whom the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ ati@@ l as the market increase interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds are faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
with bonds , the R@@ end@@ ings seem to change the direction once the initial increase / lowering is done in the cycle .
at the end of the lif@@ ec@@ ycle bin , the Deutsche Bank said immediately .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a closer and shorter bor@@ row@@ ings close to the length@@ ways and lead to a decrease of the curve .
highly emb@@ ell@@ ished bonds bear a often better income , although &quot; we were still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come an@@ alysts in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
being interesting , Jones said that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy requirements .
&quot; besides the Strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some signs that the market adapted to the higher market policy , &quot; wrote them .
short @-@ term interest has risen , the revenue curve is flat , credit lines increased and the volumes increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed fail its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies will wrap up with the bigger part of their business activities in the USA , including interest rates rising and local products will be more attractive .
multin@@ ational corpor@@ ations with high debts are worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products at the global market more expensive and the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equ@@ es to react extremely positi@@ vely , three months after initial interest in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ an@@ alysts were in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong results achieved a weak balance sheet after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital expenditure as well as low volumes in their shares were also exceeded with a low @-@ quality counter@@ parts on average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the purely stock market consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars .
as@@ par@@ agus could see gains of higher yields , even if experts in different opinion may be held , as fast as possible .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says the member of parliament of Andrew B@@ ingham
the parliament &apos;s con@@ serv@@ atives critic@@ ised the transmitter for his &quot; ins@@ ane &quot;

he also moved to the BBC Music Awards , saying that it has only been released The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; parliament @-@ collectors &quot; Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts the member of the parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does not do something that the private broadcast@@ ers do not .
the Con@@ servative Party Andrew B@@ ingham has also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ legal radio station &quot; has sil@@ ently &quot; and increasingly become more of its commercial opponents to be distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also moved to the BBC Music Awards held in December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , appear to be the Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - this are two spont@@ ane@@ ously called examples where you &apos;re actually only the im@@ itate that is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC general director showed that the BBC Radio 3 proved that the BBC Radio 3 shows far off his commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;ll learn about classical music somewhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to give the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works on behalf , I really hold that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that har@@ der had to be worked to eng@@ age the audience , as it did in the past , because the British will be informed about classical music .
radio 3 was however not the only element of BBC production , that during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport facilities under fire to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals on his feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins handle The Voice to - the musical talent show of BBC , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of $ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not originally , and not particularly striking ?
LORD Hall insi@@ sted on show that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George when judges - &quot; was produced on a special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wish that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our company &apos;s house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it st@@ ats the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to add money to the commission from other entertainment formats .
Internet sales continued in August on the slow@@ est down and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were 7 per cent increase in online selling .
last month , the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bund@@ led the virtual shopping streets , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain turned into gh@@ ost@@ alism .
but experts predi@@ ct that there are now reports that the online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers were only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the start of the record in 2000 , with just five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers show just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sales pro@@ sci@@ ut@@ to the Guardian went back in time . &quot;
he declared that the online sales increased three years ago , as buyer began to make purchases on their phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments such as home on the sofa .
but now , one comm@@ utes , and we might be able to see the growth .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for downstream sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on Friday last Friday in November .
in the past year five times the average number of buyers got around their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some merchants suc@@ cum@@ bed off .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could pick up because of bar@@ gain , buyers would be able to make purchases .
a study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 spending a little more than 1 £ online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now carried out more than one @-@ third of the purchases over web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of the people clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident of the killed - Bin Lad@@ ens family will be poll@@ uted
the bodies of 29 victims of Muslims are carried by Muslims in Mec@@ ca for the first tra@@ it@@ ments in Mec@@ ca .
Saudi Arabia puts off the collapse in part of the huge Bin Laden Group to load the load
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered together as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury them that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca .
filled in common , largely tr@@ dressed in white , the circuit to be poll@@ en , when the first of the dead left their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ eg@@ m gra@@ vey@@ ard .
the sad@@ ness of the grapes under@@ took over the holy place , where only days before a crane ran through the ceiling of the mosque , and then over@@ threw the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the fun@@ er@@ als , when the Saudi King about the construction company of the Bin Laden , due to the cat@@ astrophe , which killed 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction was imposed .
the dead bodies of 29 du@@ ers , which were killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the large central central banks of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane began when the crane collap@@ sed .
M@@ R Ak@@ ram was with his parents in front of the beginning of the annual h@@ p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already promised that the p@@ add@@ sch after Mec@@ ca will continue to go on to Mec@@ ca , who continue to go on to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , would not have to stand the arm of the wre@@ ath when he was not used .
a Arab version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language Service of the News Agency reported that details did not say that the leadership of the company abroad must be banned .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man brought to reveal what the fall of the crane suffered , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a courtyard of the grandfather , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims before H@@ add@@ sch , which later takes place in this month , were met .
the Bin Laden Group issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Decree also holds the group because of its current security measures and because they have not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surrounded by hills around Mek@@ kas is part of the massive construction project that will be guided by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades , and assumes greater construction projects .
the deceased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a graduate son who was disp@@ oss@@ essed from the family in the 1990 @-@ ies .
the crash of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the mushroom travelling , which is at least once in the life of each healthy bed .
civil servants said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials announced that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the crowd , and the same amount of permanently injured .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of endor@@ se Eastern European professionals is over
Brit@@ ons employ increasingly art@@ is@@ ans , says P@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increase behind
this leads to the fact that 200 other screens , which are situated on tra@@ des@@ men , are being opened
simultaneously , King@@ F@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets nationwide close
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City boss @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent to the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Britain carry out their hammers and brush in favour of the deployment of qualified workers that perform the work in their home
if you sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush for decor@@ ating walls , you belong now to a minority in today .
because Br@@ its do increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ men to perform home @-@ work jobs in their houses , so the Chief of the Company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ F@@ isher , who has the Baum@@ garten chain , said that a great increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ men from Eastern Europe , offering services to low @-@ depth rate , has been out@@ dated .
as a result , King@@ F@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fixed Shops , which ranks to crafts@@ men and 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ shops , because eight of ten merch@@ ant decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment their workforce remained silent .
she said it is necessary to establish the growing dem@@ ographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there are still a majority of males in our stores .
we need to move it at a balance .
in principle , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also adopted her top team to reflect a same number of males and women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including his Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - variety is an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher was a decline in the half @-@ year profit and re@@ plac@@ ements , after the group ow@@ es the cost of the closing of the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ F@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches .
member of A@@ ich / DO@@ B due to non@@ sense of court
in the regional court of Klagenfurt am Klagenfurt am formally established two func@@ tion@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball @-@ runner A@@ I / DO@@ B because of un@@ faith@@ fully and job education .
the accused pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of abuse .
in May 1992 , he was acquitted of this charge .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had emerged in the preliminary investigation , that the accused were allowed in the years 2006 to 2011 , over which they have allowed them to have transp@@ onder@@ s for private purposes .
at about 400.000 euros , he will pay the damage .
the sports work are also charged due to financial groups .
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ats , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be made at a later date .
as a result , the defence lay the defence , that at no time , the association was not present at any time .
the sports club currently counts allowance and the sport club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , in which they spent much time and money invested in debt - the liabilities was around 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( about 44@@ .000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : we lead the club more or prosp@@ ering ? &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ conv@@ ection of the financial Office .
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have decided to take money when security concerns the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in depos@@ itory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it has been agreed : you can manage the money , there are no debts to be made .
in addition , in the corresponding financial contribution , the withdrawal of the allowance is decided at the end of 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance is only years later , namely in 2003 , when an increase on the account has been paid out .
therefore , the package - and not detailed information , explained the former Ob@@ lig@@ ations .
the accounts and savings managed the two def@@ endants , together , said the second accused .
why the out@@ flow of the association could not be published in detail , in@@ quired the judge .
the club did not interested in detail for the financial ar@@ isation , important to the freedom of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , when an important investigations opened for municipal abuse , an amount of € 120,000 was posted to the annual account .
the def@@ endants were declared , declared the def@@ endants .
the stock bank was based on the names of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
it was a long answer to the questions .
then he said that he had believed that this would be the best for the club .
if something happens to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosec@@ utor took place in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed of the func@@ tion@@ aries of the func@@ tion@@ aries .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage restoration sleeve . &quot;
why rep@@ urch@@ ase ? , we want to know judge and the public prosec@@ utor .
it was the first def@@ endant , having not been associated with this formulation , because the association was never a harm .
but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; You are all of you out of the cutter . &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? , &quot; he asked .
in addition , the func@@ tion@@ er said that he never earned a cent content , he reck@@ oned only o@@ dom@@ ain@@ ees and di@@ ets .
however , on di@@ ets he charged EUR 1,000 per month , the actual effort , however , added much higher than he added .
additional documents for the early years could not point the def@@ endants .
these were according to a aud@@ iting , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer kept , declared it .
the second accused had also had o@@ dom@@ eter .

Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the ongoing head@@ count , the computer giant has been working for further jobs during the three years of the company .
there is no end to power in the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US @-@ technology group plans a reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
the company will thus be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , by selling the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around € 2.7 billion , which will inc@@ ur in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years .
hp had at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year still around 30@@ 2.000 employees .
listed in the stock exchange the Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Share amounted to 2.3 percent .
the group is currently un@@ ob@@ sol@@ ete from California &apos;s Palo Alto , so the computer and printing business are still being bund@@ led in a new company - separately from the future areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .

the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late that customers will buy smartphones and tablets rather than usual computers and always do more business online .
Whit@@ man restructuring plans will see a total of approximately 55@@ .000 jobs in total .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
direct involvement of German soldiers to mar@@ tial artists in Iraq would decrease predominantly on re@@ jection : 54 percent talked about it , 35 percent showed themselves .
that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent found positive .
in contrast , 24 percent are in contrast to the conflict .
in collaboration with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of the respon@@ dents , said 20 percent would be .
29 percent could not decide .

at the core of the fair stand up until 27 September , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the slogan &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the wide audience of the audience can be visited by the IAA from Saturday .

Ho@@ ess : violence towards Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police seized on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Dis@@ rower against several hundred in@@ dem@@ ent refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ward @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced violence at the border control point .
he told us :
a group of refugees crossing the border .
behind it had formed a police line and behind the police officer , a j@@ ector was ready .
40 to 50 refugees came with stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the civil servants .
the officials initially raised un@@ inter@@ rupt@@ edly .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
lots of trou@@ bl@@ asting was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was dissolved in 1979 .
the refugees have now been withdrawn .
an pregnant and apparently last woman was carried away from the zone .
children that had met the g@@ lim@@ ati@@ as , cried out .
other refugees worked together and suffered under respir@@ atory .
the press secretary of the Serbian police have suffered injury due to the use of rub@@ ber@@ as and pepper spray .
time of Decision on interest rates for the US score
the world ob@@ serves when the US @-@ bank is coming to two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade associated with interest or not .
a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists , conducted by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of view it was said that the F@@ ed will still do it , now think that the F@@ ed will keep still a little longer , and the interest rates on the present stand of 0 - 0,25 percent will be kept .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed Inter@@ est on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach one situation where a big central bank is leaving the zero field and a process of normal@@ ization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Sales at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is being added to a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will be added to the balance and generate only a low level of inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less reliable outlook on global conditions .
it war@@ ned against the markets , however , set up an increase , but the signs indicate that the od@@ ds of such measures are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death Row at the Delta State University left the decision to be noted .
after the shot and killing of his gir@@ l@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues , wrote Sh@@ annon upon a note to say that it might be &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could not make it happen , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that pen , lecturer for Ge@@ ography and Social @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he was shot on someone and someone killed .
in addition , he said the staff of the Emer@@ gency call to send the police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one is anno@@ yed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not ple@@ ad to him .
Lamb didn &apos;t give any explanation for its shots .
as a police came the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to do it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman that loved me . &quot;
after the writing of the note , he drove to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday night , when polic@@ emen attacked him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said that he knows nothing from the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs screening . &quot;
in spite of reports on Monday , which seems supp@@ os@@ edly believed that Pr@@ un@@ certainly had a relationship with Schmidt , said &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ ning was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am , who told her that she was about seven years as a &quot; good man &quot; described .
the two were di@@ vor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ am said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed &quot; at the bottom . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ ning her daughter , &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ usually worked online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close gir@@ l@@ friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Know@@ les said that with a dog named Light@@ ning , Know@@ les that Pr@@ iss had a dog for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said at a certain point on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ emen r@@ apped him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , he rode his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .

don Sha@@ w by Manchester United can not play monthly fre@@ igh@@ s for months
with Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester in the Champions League @-@ Champions of the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double fr@@ aging of his right B@@ one .
while def@@ ending the left def@@ enders to the weeping and to finish it for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal did not give hope that Sha@@ w could play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a promising attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V sector .
he was treated in the field for nine minutes and applied oxygen before he was taken into the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double bath structure and lies in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow or perhaps a day later , it was re@@ located and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s awesome - one boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United it is very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
he had a oxygen mask on the jacket in the cabinet .
he wept . he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the suspension of a stal@@ eness .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not punished the Mexican escape .
van G@@ aal assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee went wrong .
you can judge for themselves , if I say that a mis@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
one : &quot; thank you for Sha@@ ws &apos;s account : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken me , my path to recovery starts now , I &apos;ll be back stronger again . &quot;
thereby : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at PS@@ V
the UK defender ste@@ ep@@ ed an additional incenti@@ ve with the European Championship in France until the coming of June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this type of injury and is all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico at the World Bo@@ omer@@ ang Championships at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , this is not good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who was in another direction , so it looked like to see &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels like , I don &apos;t know how hard to be something like that .
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry for me .

surely David Cameron add the Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that will soon learn all parents : if your child loves a book it will not take long until you know it almost completely .
unless you are , you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favourite chil@@ e book , Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company super@@ camps , and goes on : &quot; fun , creative , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to give my children , because it seems to have always a picture or a message that we missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent article , in which Cameron speaking , supp@@ os@@ edly describes the action of the book , instead , adding a syn@@ op@@ ses of the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the original original text .
&quot; in the surrounding city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y who met its desire to see a real tree , met his dream , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss @-@ Geis@@ el , and who died in 1991 . however , unknown origin unknown .
as if it was not yet susp@@ icious enough , the text reads that by Cameron , reads some of the summary of the Lor@@ ax Film , which is on the web site of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial , and even the air is a commod@@ ity , hopes a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is engaged to be a pr@@ ag@@ matic father , it appears un@@ likely that Cameron stands as little familiar to the action of the book , as the local environment because of the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ur@@ king nature , &quot; which is spoken in the name of the tree &quot; is rav@@ aged . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was assigned to a hel@@ per , which the Lor@@ ax has not read for 20 times in a row .
one Dow@@ ning @-@ Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably taken by Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s voting office .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult to
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the c@@ ader , the UK for the tour , is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat at my map .
I would not close a down victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Side is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in Batt@@ ing task , and the community is powerful ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a young and positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ ors Ali was developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown level of test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from the England test g@@ ader and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as its head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , of course .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks on difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that sho@@ ck@@ et@@ ers are al@@ igned to results .
there was no rush @-@ mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , where - and I said this . players are their own best sel@@ ector .
long ago , one had extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had the control over his own fate .
when he hop@@ efully further information for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance arrives .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not make good achievements , and I will not be surprised ; he is especially a team man .
the question how much time has a test @-@ impact driver receives to be his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got 9 .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance for home and down@@ wards playing .
the only way to raise it was that England first arrived in Turkey in spite of the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a bu@@ y@@ man who I counted towards her .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ising what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire in the early season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge .
he must have at least the same od@@ ds as those obtained before him , but this depends on the use of Team properties in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to run Mo@@ een to cook in addition to cook for an extra spin Bow@@ ler and got four Qu@@ icks , di@@ pped up , and I did nothing about it .
I do not see why a stroke cannot hit there , and this left hand has already shown that it is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket Players .
mo@@ een may not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop before joining the open@@ er in 2001 .
he had made three hundred inst@@ ances immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he is very impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on an average of 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup coils that rise their hands and the coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England a few wise supplements are made while exercising .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Lin@@ awar@@ ates , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ coup .
it is one of the nic@@ est guy of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences since it has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is ready for the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and powerful applications into the setup .
I always felt that he created for the International Cri@@ cket Competition as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela has in@@ sights , of which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing cabin , even if the messages are con@@ served in line with the previously said .
coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be deployed at the One day Day@@ light , R@@ oot has a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it .
some are not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as the players receive their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not taken in light heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ going British accession from the EU ) could gain access to all if the economy is in a bott@@ led area until 2017

foreigners also have Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at who said that some member states , so deeply impos@@ e in different cr@@ ises such as the EU is now and not always from their own debt , Great Britain , created Agenda with ri@@ ven resi@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive contractual changes , they are mostly not satisfied .
in Brigh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not be even if they end@@ angered the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance of Finance will climb during summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities make a picture of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come to home and say that they gain allies for re@@ forms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to wishes an outside great Britain inside the EU &apos;s Zel@@ tes - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone tells us with France , &quot; says Berlin - and we can expect more and more short minister and officials to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go .
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel has a ally , but it has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them how it looks bad for them like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a promising power .
Poland may soon have a national@@ ist right government , Spain , in Spain .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they are going to be a blo@@ b to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be used better for it , Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tenden@@ cies can .
therefore , some such ministers possibly do not optim@@ istic about remarks , throughout the SN@@ P style , while the UK &apos;s contribut@@ or campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process in 2017 , believes my friend .
the New@@ est was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the negoti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how r@@ att@@ acking the fle@@ et Street to its costs and what EU sc@@ ep@@ tics claiming the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n to report it in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can recall my strength at Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportun@@ ists , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Straight ban@@ anas in Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his mer@@ spar@@ ity , Ed Mil@@ i@@ band knew , who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ advoc@@ ate trucks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers @-@ countries and the pseud@@ o @-@ not @-@ industri@@ alized countries have belonged to most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air had thought about it , but noted that when one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get distributed better ban@@ anas , instead of your lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mil@@ i@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he was opposed to Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s refer@@ ee , because Bl@@ air had turned down to the Constitution of the EU , who then was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which thus opened up a back@@ door .
the press has never for@@ ked him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need more time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ ott Mur@@ y Strategy of the 80 @-@ 60s to repeat , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take time but he must develop a coh@@ er@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s official position to Europe - I use convenience from - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blood @-@ ar@@ p tendency and the wild bra@@ i@@ ded of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can perhaps say anything to this Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in Radio and TV this week , when the boy sc@@ ou@@ ting in him fought , not ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s appointment of prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father stri@@ pped himself on TV , loy@@ al to his Labour cabin , without going to walk far and lose his cabin job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys Battle was even more attractive .
but to fight in &quot; under all circumstances , Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , even what J@@ C told his fellow cont@@ ests and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on Monday night .
whatever the touch @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants us - remember that he even touched me - news discipline stays in the dawn of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ y@@ al .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron &apos;s free ticket for Europe allowing us to hold corporate support in the speech campaign for a self @-@ understanding , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins th@@ inks of that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s basic multiple comm@@ it@@ ments to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite high @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of emergency discussion under the left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small sub@@ mer@@ us is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its multi @-@ big@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is fel@@ i@@ fi@@ ably convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for the withdrawal - no foreign diplom@@ ats will attempt to seek to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin use political capit@@ als , they also have a strange voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this can be point@@ less ?
the United States are already quite dis@@ ap@@ pointing from the weak military service in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government , which at the start was somewhat rec@@ alled on Monday of anything , which was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critical report by Public Health England about E @-@ cigarettes
the asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded government agency that e @-@ cigarettes is less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et admitted by critic@@ ise the instructions for the public health of the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes in their report .
P@@ he published the &quot; tab @-@ book &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have put the ability of the data on demand and the links between some experts and the tobacco industry meet .
a guide in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month laid the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy foundation , &quot; based on the P@@ he his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the alleg@@ ations made &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ rav@@ am , Professor for Clinical Epidem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the detection of the efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public is expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes is around 95 % less harmful substances that are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for a multi@@ fac@@ criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions concerning damages from different nic@@ ot@@ ine hal@@ ve products ; the results of the meeting were combined in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ am said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director told by British American Tob@@ acco funding ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants stated to the meeting , provided an average of an E @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but does not have the financing , which he should receive reports before from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added it .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not supplied , but include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , of which some are also speci@@ alize in paper financing in the paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco leadership of P@@ he participated in the session .
research work of the group &quot; refers to &quot; con@@ stri@@ k@@ ingly &quot; that there is a lack of hard evidence for the damage of most of the products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ am .
however , no such connections or limitations in the P@@ he report will be discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ rav@@ am said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes or a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Wellness at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already re@@ acted to the claims by BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are considerably less than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life cat@@ cher dies in his ad@@ dic@@ ts .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes is low compared to that , however , we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he gave the unique obligation to the public about what the proof of evidence and what is not , especially if it gives as much public confusion about the relative thre@@ ats in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people die each year in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health Care division 2 billion per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking by smoking , we meet our national competence .
BBC should play East@@ er@@ ders , says former chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC would stop to send programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial Ri@@ vals would give her right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
it critic@@ ized the BBC that it is likely to become public @-@ legal programs that probably be seen from a smaller audi@@ ences in hard @-@ disp@@ uted time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transmitters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Con@@ si@@ onal General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson reported that he tried to contact me for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have trouble with the idea that BBC programs is on behalf , or sending them that could not be demonstrated by un@@ conventional Ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson reported the upper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Communication Committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of his investigation on the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , what I don &apos;t want to keep in @-@ term or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should begin its production at least on programs that do not do others or on behalf .
they send The Voice in a prime time window , because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it is ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs is financed , which could be financed without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ el@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ est@@ ly , other channels would give up their right arm .
I would like to see me as this is to be a public television .
I don &apos;t think that this was to reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , directed channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC ow@@ d on the hunt for reviews is &quot; due to the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show that the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ d@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows would be like East@@ er@@ ders .
Johnson had said that the more publicly @-@ legal N@@ ative Programs could go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their duties , and they can argue that , if they have prepared their apparent missions to just@@ ify the legal just@@ ification of £ 4 billion . &quot; now , of course , we have prepared all those ob@@ sc@@ are programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them into a window , where nobody wanted to see them .
to the broadcast fee , Johnson re@@ ject the Committee : &quot; I challenge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , you think all , think we all think you have a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money is , if this is correct , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called that the BBC will check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to compos@@ e and maintain . &quot;
he said , only a little bit of BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio stations - and they should change this in the publicly @-@ legal TV stations in Australia and Canada .
as a question of the partner@@ ships , El@@ stein said that BBC should do more in areas like the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only one hand@@ ful of television is shown , and to make up the commercial alli@@ ances alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ odes can change the direction at the moment in which it is ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound im@@ pulses .
scientists have been grown saus@@ ages with genet@@ ically modified ner@@ ve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ odes change the direction at the moment in which they have sound im@@ pul@@ sed which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , are ir@@ radi@@ ated .
im@@ pulses are working through the turn @-@ on of mot@@ one@@ ur@@ on cells , which are genet@@ ically altered to react to the di@@ ap@@ hr@@ ag@@ m channels , which react to ultr@@ asound .
another to this topic : researchers reading and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , called son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics , at which ultr@@ asound can be used to activate a range of brain , cardiovascular and muscle cells outside the body .
Srebrenica municipality , Srebrenica , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ as@@ ive process , which gives electrical im@@ pulses to the brain treatment of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
dam@@ age@@ 1 respon@@ ds not to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani established that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , rein@@ force the ultr@@ asound waves , which then enter into the wor@@ ms .
the increased ultr@@ asound movements can work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 receptor channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the dig@@ m cells .
the sound waves carry the aperture of these iris channels and enable the cells to be m@@ apped , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultr@@ asound @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ odes , Hal@@ as@@ ani has genet@@ ically modified the wor@@ ms that some of their Mot@@ one@@ bin@@ s TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when he uses ultr@@ asound to the changed circle , sound waves are reinforced by micro@@ bl@@ iss and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ genet@@ ics , a pione@@ ering tool that enables scientists to initi@@ ate neur@@ ons with im@@ pulses of light and to switch .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ et@@ ics could have some advantages across this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , the low frequency ultr@@ asound tissue should happen , and can be sent to the brain from top to the skull .
&quot; we believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make temporary human neur@@ ons temporarily to make certain neurolog@@ ical treatments for neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight Golden rules for life in students
eleven years ago , I moved as self @-@ confident 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in belief in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now , I recall the stressed smile of them which I have been off@@ ended - and to the numerous many @-@ strong complaints about others .
most of the thing I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight single rules .
the entrance in a student residence is enough to fri@@ gh@@ tening up to completely fri@@ gh@@ tening up to completely fri@@ gh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to tell you : people tell you from where you are going when you are thinking about Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re hon@@ est@@ ly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s only a yeast extract h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
bre@@ athe in through .
help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it &apos;s the conversation and helps you find the people trying to figure out what you would not talk , even if your lashes would be burned down in fire and fire extingu@@ ishers .
let men leave .
the rooms of people are often living in beverage rec@@ tions , film night event venues and loc@@ ale meeting points , but they are also the places where people pulling in and their under@@ wear .
in this regard : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted obtained a large treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student dormitories offer a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ culture , friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing can say to you : &quot; I like you , and I want to pass through our friendship , but you must go away that I have consumed the energy , that I have consumed with you for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ it@@ ability of soci@@ ability is exhau@@ sted - and send it an SMS instead .
A@@ pro@@ po@@ s ank@@ ook : do it .
a guy in my student dormitories had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through B@@ aking .
since you start the University of Back to the zen@@ ith of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the Klo@@ pping on the doors of humans , something wei@@ rd at the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have somewhat b@@ aked . so , and now please smile when I try you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made clay plants offer a good way to close friends .
your roomm@@ ates still are committed to enter@@ tain and become associated with a marv@@ ell@@ ous surprise at the end .
of course it depends on whether you are an independent b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ums@@ y from flour , sugar and the fat carry the people to sleep , if you bet .
food to steal , is a common crime in a student halls .
of course , the har@@ sh of chicken is a theft , but is it a drop of m@@ ash for your tea ?
check it with the dairy farm .
the od@@ ds stand well that they are saying to use themselves , even if they cook in the interior .
if a man tells your stuff , it is anno@@ ying , and they have compassion on them - but try to destroy balance as my fellow worker , who added their milk to an ins@@ ing agent in order to seal th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
you should do not make noise which keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not just about to be an independent man but that you belong to the people &apos;s true sense that sit in the glass .
a girl on my way asked her neigh@@ bors , whether they make something more quiet , drum &amp; bass had a lot qui@@ eter than it arrived three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a trial in the morning .
they re@@ acted with more lu@@ cent music .
when they left at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly made their neigh@@ bors nor sleep two hours before they left their own music , closed down their door and ended up to their three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic when your future sp@@ ouse would come into the same residence hall in the same residence hall ?
the vice vers@@ a way , it would not be a ground@@ less , if you encounter a roomm@@ ates for your future sp@@ ouses , they must go again and see them every day and perhaps to see how they ride all common friends ?
of course the heart is going through its own ways - but when a hot roomm@@ ates definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try to talk about your under@@ taking a little mind .
in the exciting moment you notice that som@@ eb@@ ody has left his key in its non @-@ closed rooms , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ one appears as it seems .
a good pleasure is fun , but it takes only moments until he will get to the bite .
share by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson over security - but don &apos;t store anything bad room with t@@ ooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
complete your door , and put their key into a glass of water , which then put in the freezer , but you don &apos;t make your poss@@ essions to the ceiling no more than twice .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , all@@ ying , Ger@@ ing@@ er@@ wir@@ er
in the middle of the estate managed Markus Gil@@ mer@@ it builds a lot of money for people who did not have a lot of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus about the refugees - but also to signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need hab@@ itable space , but also the mit@@ ig@@ ning mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ray He . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show all the 44 @-@ year @-@ old says in the interview , as you can book today and easily : &quot;
thousands of refugees are on their home market .
business@@ man Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tors believed to know how quickly established residential space can be created : he builds on a project H@@ ousing Complex for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Mr. Gil@@ mer@@ cen@@ aries , many refugees live in the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ mer@@ it : a serious accommodation in containers or g@@ ym@@ s has no sustainability .
for human beings remain in a large part here .
as far as the refugee &apos;s refugee we also need a living room in the coming decades .
a whole , three storey detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ mer@@ ía : a terrac@@ ed house needs the least place .
it facilit@@ ates the integration .
this is different , if people are in blocks of blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be converted into their respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
Gil@@ mer@@ ía : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
that is reasonable .
have the rules stra@@ ight@@ forward their plans ?
Gil@@ mer@@ ía : I have been working properly in my project .
apart from it , it always makes the dro@@ v@@ elop@@ es of special construction and the regul@@ ary regulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still sub@@ du@@ ed who manages three apartments in a terrac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches .
only in cities are missing for this .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did people react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
Gil@@ mer@@ ía : there were who accused me to create a luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely does not vote .
but do you not wor@@ shipping the compet@@ itor in order to be paid ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tors : true : we were in the last five years a building boom in Germany , but were built up luxury apartments that can hardly be played .
my project has the message , also the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the united Mother , or the Ger@@ ing@@ ray He .
I show , as is today to be favourable and well to build .
it is therefore about that .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple version is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , you can download the option to download and install it .
some are flo@@ cked after installation on problems , since you received an error message that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either to wait until the look@@ out is returned or re@@ try to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has done so much easier to do so if you want to delete a special tool if you want to delete apps , and then re @-@ install it once the process is finished .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple is unable to keep the update , as the phone may turn on a half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Qu@@ il@@ ted office looks for direct contact
Sal@@ im and Al@@ ten@@ io centre have opened a new approach under the man@@ tle of the social institute and opened at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , you can also participate in courses .
social stiftung moves it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently a new office center opened there .
here , directly next to the purchase market , receive seniors and advice on questions such as nurs@@ ing insurance or achievements of the health and care materials .
for years we have established that ambul@@ atory care service , we often have been left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; even rarely many achievements of the insur@@ ances are not being used , as the complexity of the insur@@ ances will hardly be understood . &quot; explained the new head@@ master in Jutta W@@ eig@@ h , which is responsible for Anton@@ ist@@ ani and the Civil Hospital as well as to the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Amadeus . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office offers health care , health care and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ im was taken by boat .
therefore , you can use additional deals like crash prevention , remin@@ ding training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ ary complement each other in an ideal way .
sal@@ ts stands for prevention , prevention and re@@ hab .

the reason for the opening of the new branch office in the city center are particularly striking in the dem@@ ographic change .
for this will make a de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the various districts of Bamberg in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) during the inauguration festiv@@ ities , the Qu@@ arti@@ c &apos;s office also dedic@@ ates itself to the organisation &apos;s position : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite you to receive a regular sn@@ ap ar@@ rests . &quot;
this means the social institute provides a large contribution that elderly people can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ am@@ orph@@ an@@ office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm .

in addition , Sam@@ t@@ é@@ k@@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann , business transport in U@@ ta S@@ eim @-@ Schwartz and As@@ endor@@ f , mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
physi@@ cians are missing in many places in the country . in contrast , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low went into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor in the next few months even with half a half part to the site .
after a reconstruction @-@ phase , Müller opened its practice on October 12 , till then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros into the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympath@@ y for the first sight when the Fel@@ lowship of Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ overn@@ ights , who is currently completing her specialist training in the European hospital and is trying to enter the practice in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit good in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low and laugh@@ s .
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot;
the idea , in future , enjoyed the idea to operate their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the near@@ ness and the permanent contact to the patients are very attractive , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to study and accompany families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he see , soon his own boss will be too soon .
and so one was embar@@ ked , the rub@@ b@@ ish sold the house with practice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ é@@ de@@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Mu@@ eller &apos;s G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients go to the practice of Fel@@ low , in Northern German language practices there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house practice .
a positive effect of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy goes according to the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , it would have gone too .
who attended the succession call , the way continues mainly in trusted faces : assume the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force will take over the rock face .
with their departure , the medicine ended in As@@ endorf , after all , the medical profession is practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen th@@ mun@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;

your husband compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels abroad .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; the border controls are also asc@@ ended at our south border , &quot; said Minister @-@ Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
inspec@@ tions on the Hungarian border will continue in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even as it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum request , this also could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power supply and safety of humans stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear , however , that there are significant signals , &quot; said the Minister .
the people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , not on the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia denied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would leave the coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and could also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
in such a way , the Minister of the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar in La@@ bach was not , however , not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolute in@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather re@@ open the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , Croatia is already heavily controlled as outside border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , he wants to un@@ lock his borders for the refugees , but not un@@ locked .
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system does not work , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian Government said , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in Ost@@ c@@ roati@@ a , at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ ID , to exp@@ elled the registration .
in the Croatian police , it was able to take home in the lower corn fields .
according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars has been gathering including new refugees .
it was mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children .
the Red Cross are also in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
furthermore , co@@ aches of Pre@@ se@@ vo predicted at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian Serbian border , which so far had led to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , argu@@ ed that it was the way to hit certain routes : &quot; neither can we do that , nor want us to do that . &quot;
according to media reports , in the early morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived at the Serbian mar@@ g@@ inal S@@ ID , during the course of the day , additional buses were expected .
in Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which took place around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has arrived , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , it could actually be predicted to prevent the previous shi@@ fting of the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west route .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities to cut control &quot;
Croatia , Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously emphas@@ ized that his country has prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong state of refugees for possible ex@@ tradition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he didn &apos;t called , but he pointed out that Croatia is as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for limit control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you lead strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen Area .
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partners introduce a good testimony since then , subject to the standard of the border controls .
on Serbian side , approximately 300 refugees have been arrested along the Hungarian border .
according to the media reports they reported the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , both borders limits Hor@@ g@@ os and B@@ g Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees continue to continue to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior Neb@@ oj@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to soo@@ the day at a local state of hor@@ s@@ os : he will keep the debate on alternatives of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
there wouldn &apos;t be a high number of refugees at this moment .
one could not even say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or other country .
assistant rates of Mig@@ rants to - Dangerous are Alternative
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the refugees and are characterised by an alternative routes through Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not quite harm@@ less : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia @-@ wars still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine own in the border region was sent .

E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ able Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a service around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the human gest@@ ion is done , sometimes fast pac@@ ed , partly easily squ@@ ee@@ zing .
it is based on the two stations of the Mannheim Car Park on the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
town trains hold .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ bollah did this action on its 20 @-@ year anniversary and looks very clearly con@@ fron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are life , therefore we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ able is the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks , such as the volunte@@ er employees .
while wh@@ ch a Pass@@ ant spont@@ ane@@ ously to the chal@@ k attacks and pro@@ claim the proposition &quot; my life for years , &quot; to stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer &quot; to stop the war , but they &apos;re getting short , read , say sentences as &quot; so far I &apos;m still not &quot; and go further .
and again , on the si@@ del@@ ines of small discussions on the action , about life , dealing with the death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is just on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I do clearly , that for me , when the end of this world comes , I can enjoy the responsi@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ ian Hospit@@ iz@@ able Hospit@@ iz@@ able hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public effective action is good for a 20 year olds .
that is not everyone on the tablets may be clear , however it is under@@ stand@@ able , as it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death shall be adher@@ ed to as before with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer , even the Hosp@@ ice movement in the last few years has contributed much to the fact that humans can open .
an assessment , the Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id shares .
the death and sad@@ ness is one of the volunte@@ er employees in the early hour .
with a personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to eng@@ age in the risk of dying .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid met in the Order of Hon@@ our in 1995 , she was immediately reported to have been in the founding of the company in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the person concerned and relatives in private households , hospitals , nurs@@ ing secret and care in the Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another warm , keep it for precious things for the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory Hosp@@ ice Service is free and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ able .
the financial support for the sick@@ ness funds and donations of relatives and clubs allows training as well as training and super@@ vis@@ as of the death and tragedy .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ber @-@ Giant bor@@ row@@ ed its profit views on a whole year due to the weaker demand for fre@@ igh@@ ters and higher costs in his transportation services .
the company also said that she is planning to present approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share came to over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market entry 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex expressed an profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and earn $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends next May , 20 cent less than in the previous forecast .
an@@ alysts expect a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which are 4.9 percent on average and on January 4 , and despite the higher performance for Bo@@ d@@ casts of heavy and large boxes , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it is still expecting to increase income from the previous year on the basis of a cost reduction , higher income and growth in online trading .
the Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will be able to bear solid operating conditions as expected economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment have been announced a day later than the Ri@@ val@@ as UPS , who plans to hold 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
the quarter , which ended on August 31 , finished in F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , representing twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research , asked An@@ alysts predi@@ ct .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of Z@@ acks demanded the expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex resulted in a decline in the international priority claim to stag@@ n@@ ating sales in its unit Express shipping .
the boom in Online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost for larger pack@@ ets and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
at the pre @-@ market trade , about one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday , it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spent two days this week round about a 27 @-@ minute Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table sitting , to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade the control movements .
above them at an end of the restored , two @-@ storey residence sa@@ unas , is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a memory that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues to place the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ way order from Congress : to maxim@@ ize US employment and prices stable here .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have been recognized that there is an un@@ written third , financial stability : financial stability .
and this third mandate may be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be cured by the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , could make recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets t@@ ackl@@ ed these volumes by raising the interest rate for federal l@@ end - and be it only by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line could be the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Economics in the Mak@@ ler@@ ship Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that in search of a pre@@ text , the interest rate was not to increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty was to wait around the global market enough to wait &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sens@@ us about what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures on themselves the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were asked recently from Bloom@@ berg , have predicted a interest rate of this week .
however , the financial markets await the F@@ ed , with a key indication , which indicates a 30 % chance to increase an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the Strat@@ ist rank it blow out , by saying that a further increase is far away .
the Dow Jones Industrial was le@@ ap@@ ing by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 on Tuesday .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy calcul@@ ates the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have to calm the financial markets in their statement to calm the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a tax increase would be calm to the financial markets because when the F@@ ed is going to fix it .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow deep@@ ening of monetary terms which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ els had said in the spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , liber@@ alis@@ ing more economic progress , an increase of the set is expected .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , has been the lowest since more than seven years and near the level which saw the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment .
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
and although the inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them at low voltage on the job market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets around the world ended up in the end of the last month , after China had withdrawn its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average was over 16 % below its highest level in May , when investors had feared that a slow@@ down of Chinese economy would support global growth .
the market has recovered something in this month , the Dow Jones now runs almost 10 % below the May of May .
for the F@@ ed Representative , the market tur@@ bul@@ ence influences the complex lim@@ estone when to increase interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy did not appear in the last few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he says that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty in what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers .
the health of the world economy is none of the main concern of the F@@ ed , hence they shou@@ ldn &apos;t be related to this decision .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Fund is the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in the last years .
the mere reference to the then called Ben S. Bern@@ anke announced in 2013 that the F@@ ed could restri@@ ct their monetary expansion &quot; could restri@@ ct some confusion surrounding the globe .
in a world where markets and econom@@ ies are increasingly being inter@@ ro@@ gated , can super@@ v@@ ise from the F@@ ed Representative that they do not only monitor the developments in other places , but also advice with other central banks and experts to receive a better understanding for the global economy .
the decision is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ dow@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of inter@@ actions in financial market movements which have not@@ ted with the economic fundam@@ entally foundation . &quot;
L@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to interest rates , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its crash by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite lim@@ it@@ ated effects on growth in the US , &quot; said tr@@ acker .
one year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis as the market launch in 2008 , the former member said Adam S. Pos@@ en , a former member of the Committee on the dis@@ closure of the Bank of England .
the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il has not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t want to come into the situation , in which they are afraid of a interest in interest , because the markets drew off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act does not contain the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should be at the time .

Brazil &apos;s Su@@ e@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy how important nutrition during the breast@@ feeding period . it is done with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted in boo@@ bs which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies give all the nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised , its daily calories to increase by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ vor@@ ous adaptation , the mothers should be made .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women affects the genes of their babies and protects them before the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , a healthy diet of the child may neg@@ atively impact the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ f sports hall
the Bern@@ ward municipality appro@@ ves the building application for the 2,3 million euros in the sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for a solar system .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around construction at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds are prec@@ eded by step by step : in the recent meeting of this meeting , the construction entry was blessed without serious discussions .
before , the board was adopted , among others , a request to a construc@@ tive &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid earthquake plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof structure .
consequently , an &quot; ar@@ ching roof with non @-@ mit@@ om@@ able First and roof@@ top was meant to be erected .
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof of solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderful big sweet@@ ener together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the session .
the &quot; Liberation &quot; went again around the til@@ t le@@ aning , which results for energet@@ ic reasons - differently than in the development plan below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
therefore , a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the plot plan does not decline any &quot; exceptions , &quot; which moving to the administration of the municipal council in the rule during the liberation war rather restri@@ c@@ tive .
but we do not have a recur@@ ring project at the turn@@ around project : &quot; we do not make a preced@@ ent &quot; that St@@ eigen@@ berger .
gym W@@ allen@@ berg at the Sports Centre is a community project for the community and SV Bern@@ ardino .
costs around 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
grants are expected by school and transport promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be presented to the Council with the Council .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed as planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be present at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees go from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au as well .
this is shown by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district of Land@@ ing Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White confirmed .
the decision on the Supervisory Board , and the pon@@ ds commen@@ ces on Wednesday , 23 September .
plans should be realised and then all the remaining 50 employees would continue to continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with fishermen and the further existing host@@ ile station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff , which cannot be offered to Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered at home in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white .
the staff are informed about the plans .
triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the mission of Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic until the beginning of the year and has changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question that the successor is to compete , came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; which was ready to take over leadership as of 1 October , to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the home in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is an &quot; recovery &quot; and a spread of the offer within the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside of the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
transferred to the next two years , Fischer with his team will bring together both houses until then next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ y , which has still over 35 beds , will finally be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the administrative district planned for 2018 now , if the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim is finished .
ep@@ her@@ d@@ ess J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , went to face that the house , which is owned by the Federal Party &apos;s property , is to be used as a housing estate for asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say that there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such a chance do not return &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so f@@ ishers to the le@@ asi re@@ location to the Le@@ ch , who had been positi@@ vely pri@@ zed by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very under@@ stand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been a real perspective for the home in which Fischer has worked as a boss for more than 30 years .
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical Director .
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was at the last decades , repeatedly of closure , divisions were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics .

refugees Need accommodations : drug war@@ ns against H@@ ousing
the situation on the German residential property market is cl@@ amped .
also more refugees seek an affordable way .
the pressure on the apartment market is growing .
the social housing is faced with a challenge .
the mani@@ fol@@ ds on the German housing market have long been started .
with the coming refugees and test search from the EU , more people are on a market who are already over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with a income of income to the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
a study on the order of the broad@@ casts of &quot; Social H@@ ousing Development &quot; is presented at this result .
by comparison , in Germany 26@@ 0,000 units are completed .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay there is no longer oblig@@ ated to live an asylum seek@@ er in an initial accommodation .
many encounter the housing market and lined up into the long p@@ liers in front of the apartments .
but according to the Federal Statist@@ ical Office , however , less than half of all the asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market does not only have to pay homage to the rising refugees .
the study also accounts for significant per@@ sever@@ ance in the housing policy of the last years .
Germany was a housing deficit ahead of itself , which will be larger by year to year .
currently , Matthias Günther , author of the study , had already lost 77@@ 0,000 units in metrop@@ olitan areas .
many of these enterprises were therefore involved in major cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained at the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; owing to the floor in the housing market .
in the large cities , the number of square metres per capita has been reduced for the first time in the past few years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing Development &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new incenti@@ ves should boost the social housing construction again .
as a result , the Gr@@ under@@ ing employment tax could be w@@ ai@@ ved and the property tax for sponsored apartments could be suspended .
also ass@@ or@@ ted to the Alliance attractive tax @-@ ti@@ zation options .
the incenti@@ ves for refugees in the State Bank Kf@@ W has already well received in cities and municipalities already well .
a good week after the start on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the previous EUR 300 million had already been issued .
now , the project could even be applied .
refugees have free escape : Croatia and Slovenia in a corridor
according to Hungary , practically no more , there you always choose refugees in the way of Croatia .
Zagreb announces the travel through Slovenia into north without hur@@ dle .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia intends to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior Minister , and when it &apos;s necessary we will organ@@ ise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area already .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country yet .
after the de@@ fle@@ ction of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to arrive in Western Europe .
some 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , in the Croatian broad@@ c@@ aster RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of its border .
new laws , which entered into force the same day , do super@@ flu@@ ous in Hungary , practically super@@ flu@@ ous in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and reach something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police occupied the first refugees at the Serbian border on Serbia in the morning .
most of the media reports are reported in Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus as well as with taxi in the Serb border town of S@@ ID .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
during the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees meet a fence .
this sp@@ ills other d@@ angers : there are still sharp mines left from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
Min@@ d spatial plans to create a safe passage in now .
according to Hungary , barely more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police was reduced to 366 times .
just before the end of the wall on Monday there were 9@@ 380 .
the New Hungarian La@@ ws of Hungarian La@@ ws of Over@@ coming and damage to the Border z@@ a@@ us as a crime .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 pen@@ sions were initiated .
the convicted of pen@@ alties thre@@ ats up to five years and deportation in the country .
according to the immig@@ ration authority you have to meet the newly set up of trans@@ itz@@ es &quot; on Tuesday in a total of 94 asylum applications , of which nearly all - 93 - on the most important junction of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applic@@ ant are 13 families with small children and two older men .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
however , nobody has granted a view to granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the previous asylum seek@@ ers should have been lowered there .
there were only a few hundred refugees in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to clean up .
they gathered a gar@@ bage to leave the tens of thousands of people during the past weeks of the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood were min@@ ed and one of the recording facility in the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to voice this task .
Austria is only a few refugees arrive after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
furthermore , the country has strengthened its border controls .
but some 20,000 migrants were still missing from the country but in the country .
in Salzburg about 1,400 people wait for the trip to Germany .
the train service from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities on the morning .
in free@@ wheel , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
Mayor also drove &quot; over the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge at Sunday with the Au@@ dre@@ aming , when suddenly ten people were stood with passengers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ einer mayor Alois Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany was sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ pris@@ ingly , because Germany was sur@@ pris@@ ingly sur@@ pris@@ ingly , the railway traffic on Sunday was adjusted for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his assistance and drove along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the near Pass@@ au Pass@@ au .
previously , we did the uns@@ at@@ ched guests at once , with snack and drink .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said this with the car to Pass@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very than@@ k@@ ful .
a man didn &apos;t take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very pleased , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train series went on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional direction to pass after the short notice that the rail traffic was dropped to Germany after the short term , but still attempts to try to change over the border .
the regional train was placed in front of the bound@@ ary at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border generally remains high in the course .
the bridge fest joined the Bavarian neighbours , Sunday , previously a bridge of a bridge - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is embroi@@ dered to us more than thousands of us , is a logical result of an apparent field of politics :
rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately , our Federal Chancell@@ ery has officially adopted , and publicly accessible the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ lop of National Soci@@ alism .
Lei@@ d@@ trag@@ eous of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now con@@ fron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
also the vol@@ at@@ ters have to state that the &quot; gel@@ ob@@ struc@@ t country , &quot; which she has invited , and welcomed , nothing as another refugee camp .
there will be a major challenge in view of the continued refugee currents and the near win@@ ters to restore de@@ cent differences for protective seek@@ ers .
and it will be still greater - peace , security , and stability in Austria .
Konrad based on the search for 35,000 w@@ inter@@ p@@ ants Quar@@ terly
Konrad has forced to put all hands with the refugee into her hands .
Christian Konrad is usual that his word has weight .
the government used the former strong Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ kers to al@@ locate some quarters of thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the premi@@ er centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already been given a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; in his initial success .
the domin@@ ates of the 20,000 refugees who had come on Monday to Austria is without great activity , &quot; says Konrad and praised the organisation &quot; Master &apos;s performance . &quot;
by contrast , the Ministry of Interior spoke about a &quot; cr@@ ack religious situation . &quot;
a total , Konrad calcul@@ ates a total of 8@@ 5,000 quartz releases in the hot year .
in order to meet the number , 35,000 accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are supposed to deliver 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no barrel without the floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the state capit@@ alis@@ er , he performed inter@@ c@@ ations .
they had promised him , even for the coming refugees to create qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which should be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations also sets the aces coordination even into the ORF action &quot; Help , &quot; We do . &quot;
on the platform , individuals can offer individuals and complic@@ ations .
additionally , there is hop@@ ing for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for general accommodation as a &quot; very high &quot;
in emergency times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors need to have a certain height of the hand @-@ holder or the size of the finishing .
for a limited time , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply .
in contrast to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , he was able to have a greater reason , based on Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ lem@@ an who doesn &apos;t have to say without any further into the face .
the power generation is its main weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic no charge as they declared themselves .
their number of employees will therefore increase to three to four .
the first name search was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but , there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz ur@@ ges a better breakdown
first , no opening of urban sports and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees want to accommodate the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary since the person concerned may still be able to lodge without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but further sites are to be tested for bar@@ gain .
criticism of the head of the municipality on the part@@ iti@@ oning of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts have to contribute to their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : the bound@@ aries will not be sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone arrangement with the Bavarian Prime Minister , Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) was put on Monday the further procedure in the refugee &apos;s query .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er gave me a guarantee that the German borders are not sealed .
travelling further refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
however , there are now the corresponding limit checks .
special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer give it any more .
however , the protective search would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
by other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger required more reinforced solidarity in the refugee &apos;s query .
in fact , Austria also led controls to controls , is for ag@@ it@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the advance of the Germans .
the next r@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the Exchange Group S &amp; T listed , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the wise heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could present himself to invest in start@@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and to search for the search engine .
already from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to co@@ operate with the new neighbours - what does a lot promises : &quot; the next r@@ unt@@ astic is just a question of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the Land Ober@@ österreich and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building was le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as a Tech@@ centre .
more than 30 per cent of the 2700 square meters of rest in the building are already rented , for an additional 40 percent give in@@ quiries .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over it if I should not open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of its own site , in which only their hand@@ bags are sold .

the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from the city
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village whose inhabitants are an@@ cho@@ red .
this feature draws maneu@@ ver also with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always fine .
whether he witnessed a strange @-@ host@@ ho@@ ur@@ ly , journalist male dog or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office again wir@@ ls the election campaign strongly .
and cuts fine .
this is also registered in the pe@@ eling ic@@ ular town , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million h@@ erst@@ ones .
the New York with the F@@ ier@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is many in the win@@ eg@@ dorf on the wine road .
lacking in the 1200 inhabitants village is about -@@ thre@@ es@@ core corners that is related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the c@@ all@@ ele Simone Wen@@ del was shooting a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his aim , to become the most powerful man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow y@@ most exciting , but in her cal@@ ory nature were not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous spro@@ uts , in addition to Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for inf@@ ectious disease , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , according to the statement that he would also be successful if he would live in k@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
indeed , respect before the performance of the family , but also basically the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a little more common , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - is to be ro@@ oted in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump thus comes from the village of the village .
the g@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather was emigrated and opened in the USA a place for gold dig@@ gers .
laid the foundation of the real estate company in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of S.@@ W.@@ C. : their wish to return home to home , failed to the Bavarian state , to whom the Pfalz belonged .
he was not taken away because he was without homologation , because he was originally signed without permission , the Director of the Institute for Economic History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , became a movie start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ ration . &quot;
what is in contrast to the occasionally from the follow @-@ up statements .
he repeatedly said about Mexican immig@@ rants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border that caused illegal immig@@ rants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ari@@ ous , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ called tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a begotten Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the wine retired to the Americans are rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so ascending . &quot;
believe he that Tr@@ ump does come ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never takes care about himself . &quot;
the pension entit@@ lement in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came with a visit to the church organ , which was generally well attached .
&quot; I can not imagine the Donald House , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the has such ra@@ dic@@ als , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had s@@ ages at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. , as he had , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there is more interesting themes as it says &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ .@@ ich Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my president does not have it , &quot; says she .
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ el &apos;s Film , for the Tr@@ ump @-@ long interview , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ änger in the USA , and in the USA he awak@@ ens the interest .

seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson Br@@ ush@@ es to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ al leadership , but it has no major implic@@ ations on the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m g@@ ond@@ ola abolished the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Rival Chamber of Sunrise , with the hosts of David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Niagara Falls and Cancun .
this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection seemed to play an role for Australian TV viewers , with the average 39@@ 7,000 spectators at the five most capit@@ als , in comparison with Today 33@@ 9,000 .
Today posted a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its figure remained behind which from the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last months .
in August Today , Today posted an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40.000 and 50,000 was observed .
so far in September , sunrise at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators came to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 near Today .
this is the most interesting , what happened every morning .
winds of change affect those early mor@@ ants more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for checking !

the great novel@@ ty for the Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of packed to the ra@@ iny Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recent father , which closes in spreading himself with his two children on the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had asked if Thomson could bear a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and killed easily The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ ,000 ) and T@@ BL Famil@@ ies ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have an opportunity to know who the Bachelor is winning .
the woman when Sam represented in The Bachelor &apos;s Sam , was covered in the largest secret guard .
and none of the three remaining girls shall surely be in@@ advert@@ ised whether she is the one who received the last Rose .
but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows per day , before being three two , you might probably see a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood ref@@ ill up his lips until final on Thursday
all three women have left over earlier in the ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ or , amb@@ ition , family values and positive approach as reasons why they would like to be his partner in his partner .
but when the question is put , &quot; If not you , who should get global rose ? , &quot; you could destroy their answers to the game destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ age .
Je@@ av@@ &apos;s Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner of wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship between the first day .
&quot; from the moment , when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that it was quite compatible , and I thought the entire course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ ann@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is with both feet on the earth , making it so much fun together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that it was well suited for Sam Wood as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house was clear to her that Wood , &quot; One &quot; could be .
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am coming back on him now , &quot; she said .
and when asked , he was asked to choose the wood , if not she was , there was that .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girl alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle met great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent me to their impressive training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some co@@ aches have been banned from the rest of the game to the Bank as he lost a sc@@ r@@ ushing , as did the Aus@@ sie Rug@@ by League cont@@ actor at his first P@@ unt @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted in his husband and he gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and even in the ongoing game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the dressing unit after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies , he encouraged her to grin@@ d to the rest of the team by the mill .
Tom@@ s@@ ula confirmed Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ting por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by special @-@ team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ b to forget his pat@@ ern@@ ed f@@ ang and care about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne &apos;s pat@@ rol was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vi@@ kings in the first quarter
it certainly was not the start to Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian success@@ ors for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio station Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy in 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not show no worse start into his NF@@ L career ,
&quot; that was a thing that is coming to time , just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne explo@@ res the owner with his Origin in 2007 when a pass was in his own in @-@ Go@@ al region to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land .
altogether , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded the setup of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did it during the Yugoslavia War in the nin@@ eties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not on the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , asylum seek@@ ers want to slide the free elec@@ tors as fast as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ w@@ anger demanded more staff to the administration that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new aces , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
the FW body critic@@ ized that several states not resol@@ utely ready for several states : &quot; we ate most uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;

M@@ R Dh@@ acc@@ al said that police have used Tr@@ än@@ tie &apos;s police , and then pulled back into the air before re@@ trac@@ ed on rubber @-@ fin .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber com@@ rade that used to kill it , but they are traditionally used as less dead@@ ly alternative , apparently a so high death rate produced .
the strug@@ gles was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ h@@ esi say that new provinces are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , to decrease their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the Th@@ arus Group &apos;s ethnic group .

Google launches online donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( no . O ) announced a fund raising donations that will bring 11 million $ for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and exp@@ elled countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the dis@@ closure of the donation in his blog .
instead of a manager for announ@@ cing the announcement of a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud was a Google researcher who has fled to Kabul for her own personal experience when she was seven years old .
&quot; among our journey , many dark railway and bus trips , also hunger , thirst , cold and anxi@@ ety , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and some migrants has grown in Europe , many people are looking for the help of my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations are given to four non @-@ profit organisations representing aid for refugees and migrants : doctors without limits , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / year to $ 11 million .

for slightly overweight di@@ abet@@ ics , weight loss sur@@ ge@@ ons can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say , if slightly overweight people with diabetes by weight loss surgery longer than those who have non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show anything , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an article about the new study in j@@ ama .
weight loss operations or adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery use different methods to reduce the size of stomach &apos;s size .
reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to include food .
over the years , obes@@ ity has proved to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the trials were performed with people who are ob@@ ese and ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain dimension in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity - Mag@@ enb@@ acher and stomach aches - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were very overweight .
the average BMI among them who under@@ go this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
the BMI in the one who did not surgical treatments were approximately equal in 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % showed a completely new type of diabetes , and at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes slow@@ ed only in 1 percent comparing with diabetes , and partly at only approximately two percent .
in addition , the results were identified in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; in general , in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors revealed .
the researchers super@@ vis@@ es the patient &apos;s blood @-@ level hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , write the researchers .
according to the operation the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in medical therapy , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflect in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , so the gui@@ ding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also toler@@ ate average results in the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass Surgery Group lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , in comparison with positive feedback in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and showed a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit in the surgery for five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden , that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in ob@@ ese people involved in ob@@ ese people who have under@@ gone a Adi@@ pos@@ itas operation approximately 29 percent less probably in the course of 15 years - compared to a group of conventional methods .
although the new study did not have a advantage for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people with a BMI of 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because they says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group , &quot; without elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone explained that people and their doctors should start to take weight as soon as the patient with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait for a long time until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated those genetic changes , which have connected to their body with obes@@ ity and diabetes , it is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück

&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and explained that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East were ended .
the Tibetan Buddh@@ ist leaders called for the violence to end violence in the native countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of ob@@ serving refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dedicated herself Eth@@ ics studies .
it demanded that the concern of humanity concerns before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries may be ad@@ mir@@ acul@@ ously worth the refugee crisis , but the situation is not adequ@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though the Dalai Lama lies in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to sing the crisis , he stressed that it was only temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solution like a real peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim lands ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , we must think about how the killing in their countries is decreased .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never resolved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of violence and commented on George Bus@@ es after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and revealed that the US @-@ violent reaction to the US moved a chain of un@@ control@@ able occurr@@ ences .
after September 11 , I have written my supplement in a letter to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he set violence , and that was expected to be unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinfect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ed .
there are disinfect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , wine trau@@ ma and orange shower , which are very attractive to children .
ham@@ mo@@ oring templates contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
even a few syr@@ ing@@ ers can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication with very young children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; talked to Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of Gi@@ fts Centre at the Hospital of Kansas , the transmitter Fox 4 in Kan@@ sa City .
so , you would not leave off a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people let this hand disinfect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come about , then it &apos;s a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four syr@@ ing@@ es from the straw@@ berry smell of suspension agents at school , was brought to an emergency aid .
their blood alcohol concentrations was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of being dr@@ unken with adults , Dr. Chris R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey , a doctor op@@ ot@@ ation physician , who treated them in the winn@@ et Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ s their words and was not able to go when she arrived in the ambul@@ ance .
doctors super@@ vised it over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and joined the head , R@@ it@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very afraid , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s Mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinfection products outside the child &apos;s operating range .
more than alcohol in@@ tox@@ ication were in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ted by some disinfect@@ ants .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , for the shooting of slopes of slopes , which abst@@ ained non @-@ declar@@ ative ingredient .

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of the cover competition in Scottish football gets bo@@ red - de Bo@@ er
the former rank @-@ fiel@@ der and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the rank .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ ger is not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the sh@@ rank .
they speak about Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of voltage in Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see this games .
I will turn the things swe@@ ars by d@@ eil@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had already bad days , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly this - but we must go on .
we really need , really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
now it is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while increasing in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had risen from 10.000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( dating only ) .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland began to rise by 12,000 for the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 per cent during the quarter - an increase over the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
the State Secretary for Scotland , for the newest figures for Scotland , commented on : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish Labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I become a place of execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not going to sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p will be executed by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was already for the first time in January through his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I felt right .
when the day moved back , I began to fear me .
so why should I do it ?
I agree because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
there would be a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as seats , there is a spot@@ less lot@@ tery to decide which is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected will watch it emotional .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit in next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of short@@ age , with whom I have developed my own relationship in the course of months with telephone reservations and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often if we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to pick up a not@@ ebook and pen in order to record what I see .
I just need to try to remember all the details .
a repor@@ ter from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me to susp@@ end my im@@ part@@ ake .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the det@@ ain@@ ees , as He wants it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained about it with you .
she pointed out that she could have been form@@ ulate better , &quot; but it still th@@ inks that it is wrong , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I said to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants to be an international repor@@ ter present in order to write there .
if he dies , he th@@ inks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit beside me .
if you want more about the event , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to enter here on all details .
I cannot say with security that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would have him guilty , a bene@@ fic@@ er of fact .
but I believe that there is a great probability that he is not guilty of death .
I think there is no evidence that there is not suffici@@ ently pro@@ ofs to just@@ ify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really obj@@ ec@@ tively .
there will be other repor@@ ters who you can contact it .
what you can get from me is what it means to see a man should die of un@@ necessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police pursu@@ ing re@@ claimed to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police remained dry when he spoke to the man of C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Perth , caused by police , was un@@ successful when he was in the se@@ eding and sum@@ p@@ ages of water , just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police was launched on Tuesday to a peaceful decline in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , it tried to escape from them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not out , come and pick me up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ el Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t all thr@@ illed to make his uniform wet , therefore he turned a more reliable t@@ actic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good police negoti@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people will do funny devices to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
master@@ piece football player Ben c@@ ousin offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cou@@ sins had his car in the tr@@ ench , to escape an alcohol control and tried to swim about the Swan River .

Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to negoti@@ ate him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter Moody claims that st@@ ew@@ ards of Racing Victoria tried to re @-@ install a Spy in his st@@ ables and threatened to stop the race immediately .
he moved to st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ a because of a race @-@ day treatment of the last Stro@@ h@@ hal@@ m on Wednesday .
Moody &apos;s Fair@@ fax media that he is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he found himself in difficult conditions as it went to the positive co@@ b@@ alt sample at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept 18 months due to the sp@@ ying tor@@ ment , and didn &apos;t want to see it as the st@@ acking grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve got long on it , but sometimes you are fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was far away .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to make a high rise and I want to think my owner has to try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to remember what I do with my license .
prior to earlier , Moody had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ycl@@ ine that the integration department tried to sp@@ un in its stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen month , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , in a room with a man - which I will ren@@ ame - and b@@ anners to give him a job in my st@@ ables , to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moody on Rac@@ ing.com .
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they are surely tr@@ apped to their n@@ oses , because they have failed to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ g , the official president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ w , the current CEO of Route L , was aware of that today and today are still aware of today .
should I bring it to the view that it is personally ?
does Route L sei@@ ze themselves and will perhaps make people outside of sports@@ men responsible for what is going to do in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there I am .
you may have to take my license and remove me , and I don &apos;t doubt that what I say , that &apos;s what I say about it .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push it to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ str@@ ations @-@ levels of the train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting co@@ b@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ i and introduced the L@@ ate Sc@@ rat@@ ching that he could &quot; lay his license on the table . &quot;
Moody &apos;s best known for his efforts of eliminated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race day treatment procedure &quot; ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or tone on the horse deb@@ ug@@ ging was put on to the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do the full responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff is w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly applied to the leg .
it would have been that night so .
it would have been so yesterday all day so what was like that .
but it was so on the race day .
Moody could con@@ fron@@ ted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . a study of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who make these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need the rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moody . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy continues to fight against Ri@@ vals for cont@@ ests
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ized the cr@@ ackl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson announced that the arbit@@ rator drawn the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ ve &quot; with his team during the high Storm Victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett made a scar@@ cely sheet of the Storm team , after his team had made the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample @-@ example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League , and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land won &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ er@@ g of his team and said that she is just concentr@@ ating on her &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ avista added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading coach at his team is confident that they might be wor@@ ried to be struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again , I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson over tor@@ so f@@ ights , when she was struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed anything at our def@@ ensive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with sl@@ ackl@@ es to a real focus , and that &apos;s the trend for us .
Tr@@ ent is now for three years now , and he obviously has to train a great team . he is therefore probably not able to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is funny as it emerg@@ es back to this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and his ment@@ or to remember that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; long @-@ long football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was playing on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember , in 2010 St George when a bor@@ ing team was critical , and Wayne said that he will take care of a she@@ ath of di@@ vor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and play as exciting , in particular his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game that you like to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as these .
I build trust in how they say these things , because they have a bit wor@@ ried about to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us , as it went about the Big Games .
Bell@@ avista also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters experienced a higher score as the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two attempts in our game but is it an exciting game ?
or are singing and do not make a little bit ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me there are the sched@@ ules .
when they mention us , it means that we will be able to meeting in a phase .
at this weekend the Storm team got free because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land C@@ ow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales begin the next morning morning .
Serbia with $ 200,000 bond to drug ad@@ age
a man , who may have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence on the possession of over 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were for@@ ged to Que@@ ens@@ land , was freed against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic , 29 , was one of the five males who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , followed by South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was observed how he took his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a probably life sentence for an attempt to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the attor@@ ney of Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic that there was no evidence that he tried to have the entire amount and that in the Café could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ agan , was over the escape of the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared Court on Wednesday .
with the ple@@ a cause , he lied on the police over his position .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics Mother and father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the des@@ per@@ ation of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a safety of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judges &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it will not be enough to keep it out , not to appear . he war@@ ned .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic was released against b@@ ail , under the terms that he claims to leave his Australian and his Serbian passport , if police reports daily and stood at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used the phone of girls to attract female ped@@ oph@@ ile
a ped@@ oph@@ agus used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images from child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , log@@ ged into an online Mess@@ aging service , by which he received a number of un@@ acceptable pictures of children who were sent from another user .
the girl aw@@ aked in later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , the conf@@ using reports and al@@ armed forces immediately took her mother .
the police attacked and looked the five images , then analysed the computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; web @-@ resear@@ ching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search for search of in@@ resistant pictures of children used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ og@@ g then claimed that he had done it , because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and then &quot; he decided to be a police officer to make it fri@@ gh@@ tened . &quot;
the attor@@ ney at Eil@@ id@@ h Robertson said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ dic@@ tive , that it was ad@@ dic@@ tive to make people fri@@ gh@@ tened .
he gave that the Search took place in the computer of him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a police officer to make ped@@ oph@@ ile .
after his talks with the unknown entity , he asked him to send him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said that he did it to be@@ g them .
he said that he was ill in the head when he drinks , and he said he would see images of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Robertson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl had the messages written on the phone , she called her mother and was crying and in the weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then she saw also the in@@ standing images on the phone and con@@ fron@@ ted the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused was using computer and play@@ station to talk to girls who were a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , pleaded guilty in the meaning of the Indi@@ c@@ tment , un@@ disp@@ uted images of children on 14 June of the year , on 25 January this year , and not before the Court to be a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence attor@@ ney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g could not appear in the Register of sexual off@@ ences , as you could find that there is no significant sexual element in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael deals with judgment up to October to obtain background reports about social work .

along the border crossing Inn there have been more than 1,000 refugees captured along the Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were reached on foot via bridges and dust tube to the German site .
there they are re@@ sign@@ alled by the Federal Police in reception and passed on to the registration .
at Munich central railway station on Wednesday there met again more refugees according to Federal Police ( Bundes@@ wehr ) on Wednesday .
up to 8 p.m. , some 700 people in the capital had arrived at the capital , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after re @-@ launching of checks at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
Stuttgart : runner of &quot; Henry &quot; back in the South@@ west
meteor@@ ologists war@@ ns against g@@ mb@@ oph@@ ones in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
because of a low pressure range in Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the strong bapt@@ ises be the runner of the tropical city &quot; Henry &quot; , who has moved to the Atlantic Ocean in the past few days .
heavy stor@@ ms and thunder@@ storm are expected particularly in Baden .

on Friday , the Sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years the car will show its innovations at the IAA .
in 2015 , especially movement among compact cars will be recorded particularly well .
cars from the compact class are particularly popular : about 28,@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence Days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , a lot of new compact models will be presented to this year between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic instruments and new Ober@@ kl@@ as@@ se@@ - and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German high@@ lighting is the Opel Astra which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann on the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the nu@@ cle@@ us of the brand .
the volume of volume is also well sold , the new Astra should also be more expensive .
Opel presents a entry level below the Volkswagen Golf in the world with a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from € 16 990 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers additional diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / 200 hp , for which the first three @-@ cylinder petrol engine are also included .
unlike the most important compet@@ itor , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only one @-@ fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Combin@@ ation , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what is driving next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact car ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is launching the fourth generation of his Astra compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can exclusively be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
at the beginning of next year , he has also come as a station wagon at the beginning of next year .
Infin@@ iti : new Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan boom wants to find its position with the new model in the strongly growing sector .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines is fully compatible with the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also available in the offer of diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
depending on the manufacturer , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the market launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed , the compact class model DS 4 can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the precious Citroën Fe@@ er put in front of the front end : here the radiator gr@@ ille was newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was built .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons using a touch screen and the first Apple TV Car@@ Play is integrated .
at the IAA in the compact class , a series of over@@ working models and new varieties such as recorded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I was added .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has been quite righ@@ tly handed over to a former cell of the Justice Court of Te@@ gel , consisting of months for months in a small cell .
because of the injury of her human dig@@ nity , prisoners are generally entitled to pay financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells .
this decision was published by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
the interested party can even hope to spend money in spending only a few days in the room ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus a former in@@ mate was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated .
after this , the man , who has meanwhile been re@@ located on the free foot after his departure , was transferred to a larger cell .
his official liability conditions because of the in@@ dis@@ closure of the country of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court rec@@ eded the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and rejected the case again .
she viol@@ ently affect the man &apos;s human dig@@ nity .
chamber @-@ court decides about the amount of the compensation
even if legal reasons , only a few days of dis@@ closure for the compensation period are decisive , whether a compensation was given , it was called .
otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mut@@ il@@ v@@ ature of the personality is to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Life now must clari@@ fy the amount of money waste .
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past .
so they had only imprisoned in April of this incident , because he was still imprisoned in a cell in the prison cell naked .
if a decision is made worthy of 2011 , the majority of each cell is either a cell without separate toilet .
Moreover , in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court in November 2009 , Karlsruhe has also confirmed a de@@ cent accommodation for a in@@ de@@ cent purpose .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs lasted for over three months , aged between 15 and 21 hours , in a similar cell , as in the Car@@ ru@@ de district .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also remaining in the last few weeks due to lack of head@@ lines .
the det@@ ain@@ ees will therefore always be included 23 hours , and the ag@@ gression increases , it should be reached because of the cl@@ amped location .
according to the alignment of Justice , 21 places were not occupied in Te@@ gel due to young lack of young children , 19 should fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we do this &quot;
immig@@ ration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to report by Vice ch@@ anc@@ ler Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany , is even able to accept one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it , and we do this . &quot;
what occurs in Germany gives the following overview .
the forecasts are needed according to the different forecasts , between 3@@ 50000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Technology ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) Apartments each year - namely the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living room , but especially at affordable rental objects : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social dwellings made out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments , too .
Federal Minister for the Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from € 518 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social dwellings in each year and have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion annually .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister for housing are in fact that there is also more tax advantages for investments into housing .
according to the institute for labor market and professional research , it is assumed that in the long @-@ term 55 percent of the inhabitants will be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany could not be system@@ atically asked after their qualification to help them win the entry authority , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they will find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreci@@ ation in the admission period , but also for self @-@ est@@ e@@ em of the immig@@ rants , says migration researcher Dietrich thr@@ ott@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ill@@ hardt , a political shift was given : of the prohibition of refugees for recognition of work .
while earlier , a work was banned for asylum seek@@ ers up to five years , this has been reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that asylum seek@@ ers will be limited to a place of residence .
in society , the company has passed itself - also due to lack of obj@@ ection - majority of views are passed , that refugees should be facilit@@ ated faster than the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
until now there is no issue on general and related Spanish language courses .
research shows that jobs are most frequently convey@@ ed by personal contact .
the structure of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ hardt of the König@@ s@@ weg path .
the Berlin School of School has found that only a few f@@ ooth@@ ed parents have their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ root of parents it is only important to meet the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ diag@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate department .
to convince the family from the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration office is distributed in various languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators intensi@@ fied by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacities - about by increasing more technical schools .
students are prepared for tuition in the countries without German language skills .
they are not always taught by teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no need for them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ill from the Berlin School of Culture .
the German student union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
prin@@ cip@@ ally , there is no Federal Minister of As@@ ylum . the only exception was to date Berlin , In@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) but now abandoned his position .
courses willing to facilitate the entrance to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or dul@@ c@@ ary will not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ ers law , if they start a study .
the latter has basically no B@@ af@@ o@@ g , because they are not falling below the circle of pe@@ af@@ ers .
Ged@@ ali@@ ded refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months .
but this financing of financing needs to be closed but is asking for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin@@ s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play an important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and many are the religion important part of their identity .
Islam will succ@@ essi@@ vely split the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state churches are to develop into a new state @-@ religi@@ ons .
the establishment of a islam@@ ic effect also would be profession@@ ally taken care of the new@@ com@@ ings .
one of the rights belong to the right .
thus representatives of Islam must be at clear contacts and ready to work together with the state in many fields and to l@@ umen him certain control options .
the read@@ iness to act against religious foundation alism is also being heard .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , expressed as wor@@ ried about wor@@ ried about religious conflicts may also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to leave these conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately got their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
he suggested that it is Arabic to translate the Basic Law .
integration will in the future be much more than now a theme throughout society .
thereby , the majority society has to change the dis@@ assembly of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
in fact - as a result of European decisions , an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general equilibrium principle .
however , it is very slow as the NSU @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed that the police and authorities have system@@ atically igno@@ red the rac@@ ial motif .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ raine organisations and advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white German labor need to ask for many years , and for what international agreement , as the anti @-@ terrorism law parties must commit to become reality in the next few years , if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - at the sole of all .
in general , Germany has been able to medi@@ cally care of medical attention so far , the state of medical scientist Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the daily mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , all deriv@@ atives should be suspended at registration of health haz@@ ard .
this could be completed later by the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly desirable , so many people are careful with the limited performance catalog to see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise the physi@@ cians make the bar@@ ri@@ ers especially to create .
already before , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proved , migran@@ t bad about their diseases have been en@@ ligh@@ tened than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over .
many refugees too have been helped with more common medical atten@@ tions in emergency shel@@ ters .
and with another diagnostic view .
among young refugees , there are clearly more disp@@ uted Dis@@ abilities , and in the yo@@ ungst@@ ers there go about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
with the partial other diseases of the disease German doctors of their training , however , Mont@@ gom@@ ery tells us .
&quot; paras@@ ite cas@@ k or tuber@@ culosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and whatever the general audience does , let the refugees suffer imp@@ el@@ ight in sight .
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even physi@@ cians .
in order to be pract@@ ised , they would have to prove their qualification and wi@@ eld the wom@@ ens@@ able tests .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is psychological - according to the state psycho@@ therap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post@@ oper@@ y distur@@ b@@ ance or de@@ pres@@ sions .
among the leaders of the young refugees , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study published by the Technical University of Munich that the 5th Syrian refugee camp was trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany .
who &apos;s in a post@@ oper@@ atic stress @-@ disorder is that , amongst others , do so @-@ called Flash@@ back with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart failure and fat@@ alities .
other symptoms include sleep and concentr@@ ating disorders , strong scre@@ ech@@ ing and emotional dew .
in order to prevent the symptoms become chronic , a early treatment declared , declared Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ic sick refugees live a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social cases , non @-@ lab@@ our@@ ers or doctors who are not trained for the psych@@ ic illness , will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to in@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream

for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
so the gift for enthusiasm lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away the people of her daily work and to bring them to a completely different world for two hours , under@@ lines the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; is it not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well too good . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every survi@@ ving unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read from eyes after every wish .
we want to work together with animals and have fun with them .
but the beast doesn &apos;t feel well , I don &apos;t want to fly to the Man@@ ege .
the most important commandment is : good for animals .
especially on her Zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of one of Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is pro@@ ud@@ ly proud of .

Zimbabwe Robert Mug@@ abe speaks false speech at Parliament
M@@ R Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
it remained bad , but the video of the Falls spread rapidly via the social media .
the opening of the Parliament also revealed by alleg@@ ations of representatives of the opposition to alleged that they had been war@@ ned of anonymous k@@ im@@ ents , and they had been war@@ ned to accompany the response of Mr Mug@@ abe in Bu@@ h@@ call .
last month , they had ar@@ isen him , and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opponents have received SMS messages on their mobile phones which they were war@@ ned to trouble with Mr. Mug@@ abe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she said the title &apos; death &apos; , said he said journalists in Mug@@ ab@@ es .
they war@@ ns the members of parliament in the Parliament , and once they left the parliament , and once they left the parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the head on the party , led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is concerned about the d@@ angers to the politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is likely to have 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings in the company &apos;s services .
hp will be divided into two listed companies later this year , both computer and printers business from his faster @-@ growing company hardware and its service operations .
the expected job loss leads to a burden of over € 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise &quot; , said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ person and Chief Executive who is to guide the unit after the separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and stronger than HP announced today , and we have a broad and deep@@ en portfolio of shops that support businesses to transition to a new style of businesses , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focusing on the provision of highly integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des an enterprise that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ equipment and the Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sil@@ icon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring process to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturers , and one of the largest U.S. @-@ tech company , is the latest in this area , that is based on the convic@@ tion that focused on a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates from the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb has to stand behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
W@@ enger stressed by Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation after plan runs , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back on Christmas Eve .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will be surely still un@@ certain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had long ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ al injury and then returned to its old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not breaking his career , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it is a bone that healed not well .
this is not a larger matter .
it was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with its Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries which he had before .
that may be from pure medical point of view , but as W@@ enger has also accepted , there is the associated risks of other injuries , always when a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ as 157 Lig@@ as@@ games in the last five games .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they have played in six hours of play@@ times since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League clubs , who were able to list most vulner@@ able days .
W@@ enger accepts the potential of an Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ie , but Arsenal believed that there is an improvement in the risk of injuries during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you return an injury , you have a su@@ cking time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; said W@@ enger .
jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabil@@ ized , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind it deserv@@ es .
Arsenal starts its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo &apos;s race against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on next Wednesday , and W@@ enger is introducing a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta will start .
W@@ enger can also start with k@@ elling gi@@ b@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and draw the players who need it , a small decl@@ aring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are made clear to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playground with the biggest insertion effects in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ sealed campaign &quot; campaign launched during the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday , where the numbers were measured at the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal has caught the teaching out of last season with the Champions League criticism against Monaco and remains committed by far hope , with his management the association to lead the association to his first European ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immen@@ sely , &quot; said W@@ enger .
it has never been folded for ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m very long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not a dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ ship Festival : the Com@@ edy show , giving us serious lessons over men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what the need for men to open themselves , now even des@@ per@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ates among young males prove on a 15 @-@ year h@@ och .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and there are three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against The Living Mis@@ er@@ ote ( CA@@ P@@ - campaign against her@@ ed@@ al life ) in 2015 announced the year of man to ask the culture that seek culture in question , if they need these need .
friendship is the heart of the heart in battle to master this challenge .
a current study at more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pres@@ sive symptoms determined that if the l@@ apping had enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy attitude &quot; , has doubled its chances in satisfaction .
for those who are non de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends cop@@ per@@ ates the risk of mental problems .
but of course you have to have any friends , so that a friendship can work for .
in the age of social media , communication with its focus on the substance , the in@@ ability of response is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , fun and successfully to appear , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what Psych@@ ologists represent several differences ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship which impact on our mental health much more deep @-@ feeling .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire , money declared , money could not really buy .
the beauty in friends was that this focus was put on my head .
each character has not been defined by his work but through its personality who finally sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
hum@@ or of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents during football gu@@ ises in cozy s@@ ills and his desire from Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to any case , even if they often go back to explore fully their feelings .
as a staff of the telephone line I declared to me : ... &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who are de@@ pressed by de@@ press@@ ors and showed me really clearly how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
the old familiar phr@@ ase &quot; I come with it righ@@ tly , &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you speak about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term growth mechanisms .

di Maria meets , to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malmö .
angel Di Maria celebrates his hits against Malmö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
in his debut in the Champions League , on Tuesday , the PS@@ G helps in Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the Re@@ action on the Game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani was held when Paris Saint @-@ Germain commenced his Champions League 2010 with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ ticket stadium on Tuesday .
when Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion out on the way , but thereafter they missed a series of opportunities before it finally achieved a head Gate in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sh@@ am@@ j@@ or Don@@ etsk , in the group A , Paris is taking a strong start against the Swedish champion , since it is not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Th@@ reg@@ ain , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no class game of Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ in &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an Ibrah@@ im@@ ov@@ ics missed opportunities before the gate . he became later in play against his home town team and against the club , with which he started his lively career back in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or downhill to the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause problems and relax , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , though I am sorry that we didn &apos;t have one or two more gates . &quot;
Ibrah@@ im@@ ovic returned to his injury on one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , which was holding a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the First division , but was finally engraved in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argentin@@ ian imp@@ eller , called the PS@@ G , was taken over to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , when he entered in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö opposite , before he graduated in Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any one believed that PS@@ G would gain a big win , it was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Malmö , the Cel@@ tic in a Play @-@ off hit the field , came up with nine national players on the field and was rounded up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a serious opponent .
but except a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who was far presented to Kevin Tr@@ apps on the 34@@ th minute , they made little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself were sometimes up , with some mis@@ si@@ ze@@ es and bad conclusion , not least of Ibrah@@ im@@ ovic , who was rolled out at no less than five trials alone in the first half , then after Cav@@ ani had used him after a re@@ boot .
nevertheless he did much more creature when he brought his opponent in the game , and it was a pass from Ibrah@@ im@@ ovic , who was related to Di Maria in a shooting incident , who was buried in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole . ...
the second gate was at last shortly after the Cav@@ ani km mark . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth part of the season , after rec@@ tan@@ ovic had caught a left slope of Max@@ well .
this finished all thoughts that Malmö could come back , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from no shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result down before replacement player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , age Har@@ ei@@ de gave later that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have played only in the Swedish League that did not have the same level .
the Quali@@ fications are not enough . &quot;
hat to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented from 2008 Transfer to FC Bayern
world Champion and European champion X@@ avi played for al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern stood obviously almost few years ago before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , which played for FC Barcelona at the time .
eight times of Spanish champion , three times winner winner , four times Champions League winner , two time European champion , two times European champion , a time World Champion , the title of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to Qatar @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca Ver@@ t X@@ avi , I now hear that he stood before the departure from Barcelona in 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid has everything , we did nothing , &quot; he tells you .
and the registered name of the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a quot@@ ation of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in memory : Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern in the summer of 2008 .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi failed ?
but the change was not found .
and the decisive man has now been working for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explain why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has seized Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a magnificent house . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ EP said to me that I couldn &apos;t change that he could not present himself without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that he has been re@@ spite . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns 2008 / 2009 would have walked with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the Bavarian , split the Red Square ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown did sho@@ cked him to un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor from The Mar@@ ti@@ an .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the industry , Ben E@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers in order to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to think people think about it - who will always be the director - as they deal with the harmony of the Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and it is a n@@ ut@@ te which is sm@@ itten with its white growth .
the producer of Mr. White People set himself for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for the control rights in the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end we could spend something , what we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain your diversity - that is SO @-@ K@@ NO@@ W . &quot;
the twe@@ et has been selling more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 le@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time of representation in the media at the top of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the movement Black Li@@ ves achieved a nationwide effect and displacement of law and authorities , dis@@ co @-@ discrimination against color content .
in February , the singer Prince found Prince &apos;s play during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) .
like books and black life , albums have still their significance .
in younger time , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of Fox News @-@ personality Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ as a group of hat@@ ch as a hat@@ red group should be considered .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on had been on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producer and media @-@ mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope , to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .

professional Sport@@ kl@@ ing and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athl@@ ete , who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million with home .
the competition Show , which finished her 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant who could close all levels of its obst@@ acle course .
during the season finale there were two men , cal@@ am@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final .
the climbing site was one of the 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I never earned more than 10,000 $ or her life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so completely suddenly . as I can imagine even how this is ... the future is unknown .
the Chief producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went down with The Hollywood repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why he finished first at all , not any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , the one receives the quick@@ est time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how very the money is a wonderful place and changing life , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think that he swe@@ pt up about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
mass of awards received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his sons and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be sm@@ itten one from someone , I &apos;m glad , that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt so , if they had caught the rolls .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an extended season and will start shooting in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers turn@@ outs on Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s
MIN@@ ING L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Sp@@ o@@ iler , but played a perfect match against Minnesota &apos;s Twin@@ s with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the Twin@@ s scored a chance to asc@@ end into a play@@ side of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , that was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make a fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon maintained its early general support when Detroit lost three times in the first two inside , then in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) nar@@ rated for 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to qu@@ it this year , &quot; said Simon .
it is hard to throw each game in the bul@@ l@@ pen of each game , and therefore I will be concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and stayed in two inst@@ ances , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit @-@ hit @-@ game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits in Seattle , on July 6th .
&quot; he said well , &quot; he said well , &quot; he said .
he looked good when ( running training ) , look much better from the bul@@ l@@ ad , and he got it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the back end of the seventh inning , Twin@@ s had its best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning d@@ inning with a double on the left field line .
the Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a bun@@ ch , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Hard@@ y left by the left hand .
Hard@@ y out@@ lasted the wall , the only man that was con@@ fron@@ ted with him , in front of the designated Rook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , which was offered a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the finish Run in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen took the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play .
it was the major league in the Major League leading 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe had a Double Play .
after Detroit finished at the end of the ninth cable , a R@@ B@@ I double was able to put an R@@ B@@ I double against the C@@ loser Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right handed down is S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for the Fifth Save .
Detroit was prof@@ ited for the opening of the game by an even event@@ ful Phil Hug@@ hes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the ro@@ bes of the veter@@ ans that had been kn@@ itted in front of the game of the herd , after having missed more than a month because of a back @-@ face .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , whom I w@@ ished , &quot; said Hug@@ hes , &quot; but I felt happ@@ ier when I got rid of that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after they received the first lead to the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es introduced a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ks .
a two @-@ Out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought the play Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z succeeded in his 0 @-@ 21 business series with the laps in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos , with a single on the right , managed a further Run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to go to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers in the second saw an One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said Twin@@ s Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not be well beaten , but he caught the right spot .
Hug@@ hes found herself in a pitch @-@ Count , recorded no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ability A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hug@@ hes came in three hits in six hits and a walk with four bands .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP An@@ i@@ bal San@@ chez was separated from the violation of the ap@@ ex .
he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who started the finishing shoulder in San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , on the second position of the herd , in mid @-@ August , due to a shoulder of shoulder , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the po@@ d@@ list to start against the Twin@@ s .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers , since he has been in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he has ste@@ amed since 20 August due to a dis@@ closure of the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and the Twin@@ s will finish their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday

Isch@@ l : German military measures in Syria
the leaders of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Il@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a way .
&quot; I believe that the far@@ ewell of military options may not be held without Germany , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago it was delighted to give the cup of a military participation in Germany .

in Germany Austria , Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Austrian Minister for Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained the Austrian television station on Tu@@ esdays , but no one would now send back no one to Hungary .
Germany also has no refugees to return to Austria .
&quot; no , that is agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could take a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already given talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
there was no concrete figures called it and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees reached the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your objective is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann formally applied together with several other EU heads of state and government to a special summit for next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states did not have a common occurr@@ ence in the crisis so far .
the EU interior ministers want to take a new mark on the upcoming distribution of another 120 000 refugees on the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of a strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support people in the first intake and distribution of people .
the alliance will be doing this jointly with the countries , Merkel announced at the end of the end evening after nearly four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ score , those people who bre@@ w@@ ed protection , can do it as well .
but those who have no lead perspective , cannot be kept in Germany .
this idea was in@@ scri@@ bed in the round .
the German Chancellor explained the state as a whole , to cope with an &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
thousands of des@@ per@@ ate refugees have now been spot@@ ted on the Balk@@ ans .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometer border to Serbia during the night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , including the border with a fence .
this neighbour &apos;s neighbour belongs to the EU in differently than Serbia .
Hungary wanted to prevent the tu@@ g of damage from Romania , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ as said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ as said to the planned new limits .
the Romanian government thus condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut fence .

this dew point is only small but nevertheless too big for an almost constant cel@@ est@@ ial body , it is said in a communication of the Corn@@ ell university in I@@ th@@ aca ( U.S. state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers have presented their analyses in the journal I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was no longer known that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ er@@ us li@@ que@@ fied water must be given .

no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain much sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he that desire to battles against his slim line , often her@@ al@@ ded by them often .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
good are the exotic fruit : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all contain Mang@@ os but a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta carot@@ ene .
whoever e@@ ats the fruits , thus supports visual force , immune system , and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying Mang@@ os , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or to be anno@@ ying and cre@@ ep .
the sh@@ ell@@ fish alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gan@@ os can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within few days .
then they taste of course or sweet food .
but a man@@ go there is also heart@@ ed dishes .
she mil@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of leaf sal@@ ads such as Chic@@ o@@ ree and Radi@@ c@@ cio .

Rome now has a Martin Luther &apos;s Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of town President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened a well @-@ known place in the Park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hill on the name of the German reform@@ ator .
in the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he was honoured as a German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation .
the park is right in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Con@@ sortium for the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants in the town of the Pop@@ es were able to live more than min@@ orities many centuries ago .
with the square , it becomes visible in a symbolic manner that their tradition is welcome to the Christian faith in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ in@@ ad@@ mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time than those who fall into sin .
his negative impressions could em@@ bol@@ ted him , according to the view from hist@@ ori@@ ans in his future fight against Rome .
in Luther n@@ Luther was then directed the split of the Swedish church with his thes@@ es .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the haupt@@ werke , which has made by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with magnificent images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no way syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective topics can be adjusted rather dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been working on his Bible project for which he has hit a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection of the many different areas of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cycles of the way are the cycles that dev@@ ote yourself into the issues such as the way of the way , cre@@ ages , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
the same thing has been fascin@@ ated by several partners : this is true of the Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler World @-@ Verlag with its focus on artistic books .
and that is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible verses .
he interpreted the bi@@ ble Bible by the Ot@@ mar Old Bible and translated into current connections . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirrors from Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded in between the original biblical verses of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jew@@ ellery band has gold letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately even trig@@ gers for the Bible : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant powers of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing of the education took place on the cane wind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to re@@ work this to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to restore the art in faster time again : &quot; the perception of image worlds is influenced by the l@@ ame and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is pushed into action .
artists have another desire and desire to show things .
pictures have always some mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard I am a din@@ os@@ aur . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt let like that the viewer in the images &quot; let him go , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stopped this Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like to know how he is living with his images . &quot;
the Bible did not estimate that the Bible is completely appro@@ ached to capture the Bible , which is important for him even mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no co @-@ operation on the eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the pictures depic@@ ting the text &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; merely &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it was a pictures of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to inv@@ ent his life in freedom and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts are talking for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas photographs - will be presented at an exhibition in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction commen@@ ces for BM@@ X train
plans made , place found , contrac@@ ting down ground for a round course : one year later was almost everything ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train , it was already over .
sl@@ ander@@ ers in policy and administration offices for an@@ dr@@ uss , especially when people wanted to pro@@ claim rail@@ ways .
so hills moved up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permission was to be initiated in October , the first concer@@ t@@ art@@ in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock has now allowed to communicate in children &apos;s und youth committee .
&quot; I hope that this year was even more visible , &quot; she said .
then there should be &quot; more commemorative break &quot; with works at the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to the end of 2019 , while the Bundesliga was a significant sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ vely position in Germany and sec@@ ures politics impos@@ ing its help in preserv@@ ing the pending problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there no one can tell no one , that &apos;s nothing but I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that must be interested in every individual to get this topic in the grip , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Lo@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Regist@@ ler@@ amt and meet the State Secretary of Mr@@ s An@@ o@@ ğ@@ ce and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic is certainly to play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football could help and help .
but the decisive turn@@ around has to place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football Association is so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some Federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
already at this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ brill@@ ator set a clear sign when it takes place on the left of tri@@ k@@ ot@@ mel , instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) to help &quot; Help &quot; - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; will take place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make sure that all of them should help , where and how they can only play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports head of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called the project as &quot; self image &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; The refugee drama appears every man , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football world@@ ly , no , we must use our jet power to help our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredible , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
the Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig said from a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
for the EM quali@@ fier on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
kidney best@@ owed the support of refugees as a &quot; large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licens@@ ing had started their own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we have spent , we lived in football .
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association will jointly with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , reported ren@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP board of government loses an eye when an accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye because of the fall of July .
when the accident at the steps in the home of his brother in the USA he fell to a water glass , which he had borne in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost le@@ ver@@ ed , was rewarded and dr@@ ag@@ ged on the road - that he tells us so very last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so flat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could lead his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager would be able to work with the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of labour &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and lead further to the software corporation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I got the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and whose chairman Has@@ so ak@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t insi@@ sted between Germany and the USA , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can pass through such a thing . &quot;
&quot; important is to qu@@ it again , if we go down . &quot;
McLaren @-@ substitute Master Magn@@ ussen An@@ gle ...

football : Bv@@ H without re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : wheat flour in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes raised to a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of the Europe League .
the national player will be missing the table leader of the football team in the du@@ el with the FC Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t look back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match of Le@@ verk@@ usen : &quot; we expect the Bv@@ B coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high intensity of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem from the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ ter@@ position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes a lot of art@@ ender Roman Pain@@ ki .
&quot; he trained in absolute top level , &quot; the football @-@ teacher gave the world champion .
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open for the future in all Europe league @-@ games , but Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open .
with high probability , it will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ge statement by Mit@@ ch Re@@ us that the final entry for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League will be the goal , keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ trac@@ table : &quot; that &apos;s not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to enter a pione@@ ering role in Germany
Germany shall be according to the will of the Federal Government on the change of the car technological potential .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the home of traffic minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which provides an investment in expanding digital infrastructure .
he added Do@@ fi@@ dt on Wednesday at the edge of the International Motor Show at Frankfurt am Main .
the automated and connected driving will boost traffic security and ensure less stress , Do@@ fi@@ dt said .
he wants to discuss the topic even with his counter@@ part from the G7 states that come together with representatives from the industry .
the Austrian Foreign Ministry is emphas@@ ising the importance of the mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid transit on digital radio stations among others .
at the moment of testing new technology , a test track is currently running on highway 9 in Bavaria .
the German government wants to examine the legal requirements of any additional dis@@ claim@@ ers in order to verify the legal requirements , and where necessary to custom@@ ize the new developments .
as a result , Germany is willing to announce that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government will also serve as an amendment to the Vienna Convention , which has so far only made man as driver .
when automated driving takes over the car over increasing the car , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless we are still expected to expect vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 .
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD Transport S@@ ör@@ en Bart@@ ol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of liability in accidents and security of personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are more sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than Fr@@ ench@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on the AA @-@ specified survey of the For@@ sa Institute in order to ensure that only eight percent of the Germans are believ@@ ing that in @-@ risk cars will go through in the next ten years , 32 percent are reck@@ oned in 20 years , 31 per cent believe in all at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents in 2025 will count to 33 percent of respon@@ dents in the US .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to leave themselves on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a collection of the digital remaining IT@@ KO@@ M , only seven percent would agree to control the control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , there could be 15 per cent of traffic in the final traffic , which is 45 percent .
well each V@@ oting would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ work and double start at ping p@@ ong @-@ EM
according to actual stand at present , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer intends to attack a single session on September 25 to October 4 only .
the final decision should be on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title also without Timo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll has been at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed center in China in China .
the 34 year @-@ old German Master is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer a clear Favor@@ it , &quot; explained single European champion Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ er@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remin@@ ded the EM 2013 in the chat .
&quot; at that time Timo was ste@@ aming , and we became European . &quot;
&quot; at this time , we should mem@@ ori@@ ze , &quot; declared the World R@@ ank@@ ings @-@ Fifth .
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has pulled a serious infr@@ ing@@ ement at the right B@@ one .

Gaul@@ tier feels like being old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mixture of quite a large fashion show and one wax figures for string quartet : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which seem to look like human @-@ projection thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular creation of the French designer , who was play stage out@@ fits among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the large star of the fashion scene - so that he put males in Rö@@ cke .
&quot; I can no longer say that I really caught the enf@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was easy to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen on September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a lucky enough to have changed the fashion to a look at a show over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me had sound a little bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when people die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made the most impressive collection in Canada and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it goes to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written a fashion history without ever completed an apprenti@@ ces@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the vision is not built , but it &apos;s an excellent chore@@ ographic work that has been operated for much effort : to continuously ze the d@@ olls , for example , a styl@@ ist was hired .
after 14 tons of material , the makers lost Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot according to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest was a special scar@@ let in doing so : a leather out@@ fit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sl@@ ender as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier .
also Gaul@@ t@@ ers old Teddy is exhibited in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , slo@@ ppy mo@@ de@@ man experiments of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) , he was attracted to his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , Gaul@@ tier .
his parents have not allowed him to play with a doll .
the t@@ oss of Fashion have subsequently transferred itself later .
he st@@ ole fashion signatures and looked upon the designs of other designer , as Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it but naturally .
for his first own mo@@ at review , he has not allowed to pay the models .
so they got no@@ where , but they kept the clothes .
jewelry instead curtains - Pl@@ au@@ ener peak as fashion niche
previously , it went on the long der@@ y machines in order to make it about one meter .
the embroi@@ dered substances and tips were created in great amount for customers that they re@@ processed for instance , ceilings and curtains .
today the just doesn &apos;t work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of fashion show seats .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the pointed tip , fashion played a major role in fashion , was pushed by the home textiles industry and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt introduces several examples : top of jewelry , for accessories such as bags and regional trails .
even the so @-@ called vintage style , which reflect on the past Stil@@ ep@@ o@@ chen , uses a increasing client potential .
none of the chemicals sector in the textile industry is no longer served on the market .
half of all orders have been made with us already .
fashion stories Pl@@ auen , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association pl@@ au@@ ener lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
over 80 percent of sales have been taken away in the last 15 years .
private specialist stores and also wholesale are almost no longer available .
our products are almost no longer reach our customers on this way .
the mass goods become cheaper in the Asian region today and is almost entirely distributed over chains .
in addition , exports , currently to Russia and the USA .
sufficient reasons for new ways .
in order to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer made by the embroi@@ der@@ y in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year , we have introduced a seal of quality , that shows that we are able to produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
she designer U@@ te Schmidt is taught at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au and specialized in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips at the Faculty of Applied Arts .
in order to meet the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it needs time and courage .
it arises a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories which need to think all economically concerned , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a building of existing design is often only varied to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , fashion designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter new the historic sn@@ all@@ ast@@ er@@ head .
the machine embroi@@ dered in some places small ch@@ icks .
the pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ sch@@ mi@@ ed@@ em@@ eist@@ er Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ g was inspired : &quot; I was able to do nothing with the traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ fl@@ ap for her jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate procedure , it domin@@ ates the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Ho@@ ek - both young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
she also supplies the USA , to Australia , and to Finland - especially on customers whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ aces and surroundings . they would like to have a reminder of a reminder .
with this I see my jew@@ ellery as a modern ambassador for the Pl@@ au@@ ener top .
Disney Plan new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ Film

according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; it doesn &apos;t have a new re@@ spiration , but for a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical child ma@@ ids .
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family of Ban@@ ks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins and plays more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director already stands out : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

big no@@ d@@ fish already are so strong with mercury so that , on the basis of the limit values , about 50 per cent of the catch can &apos;t be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.5 percent would have been in@@ sufficient .
in return for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish at present from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , acknowledged this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller gra@@ b @-@ fish , such as car@@ p usually are so low , that they already hold the planned maximum value today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ mi@@ dt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that this is why &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ verse of de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that is strongly vulner@@ able to the food chain in particular in pir@@ ates .
the Federal Government war@@ ns against it that &quot; low quantities of the nerv@@ ous system will cause &quot; already small amounts of damage to the nerv@@ ous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Environment declared on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however that a &quot; health concern of the population population &quot; must not be expected .
mercury is primarily due to coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Federal State , Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck issued more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the German coal power issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish about light@@ years in the river Elbe , Rhine and the Danube was exceeded &quot; Perman@@ ently and widespread dis@@ closures , &quot; the Spiegel &quot; had been quoted from paper in March .
last year , the war@@ nings related to mercury in fish already related to the most common health Ris@@ ks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
