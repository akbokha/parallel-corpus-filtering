the aim of the securing procedures in this Convention is the timely discovery of nuclear weapons of peaceful nu@@ kl@@ ear@@ ing activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other core compounds for non @-@ known purposes as well as the deter@@ rent of such a de@@ we@@ al@@ ment through the risk of early @-@ time discovery .
for sub@@ sist@@ ence of the article 28 established target , the materi@@ al@@ location of fundamental importance , related to the sp@@ ati@@ al input and observation as an important compl@@ ementary measures , used .

H ) procedures for rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this Convention do not stretch on material in the mining or the Ar@@ tis@@ ation .
B ) will not date urine - or th@@ ori@@ ous material that has not been achieved in states , so divide the community of the organisation and composition of the material with , unless it is not specifically implemented for specific non @-@ specific purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear power material , which is manufactured according to the composition and pur@@ ity for fuel production or the process line , in which it is produced , or is introduced to the core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear plant material created in the States , so it is subject to the other in this Convention .
a ) The measures specified in this Convention shall not be termin@@ ated for nuclear plants among the conditions mentioned in Article 11 mentioned prere@@ quis@@ ites , the comm@@ union of nuclear material , the securing measures after that Convention is not possible , re@@ fill out the organisation and the community with each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The backup measures specified in this Convention shall be concluded under Article 13 mentioned requirements , provided that the organisation and the community will determine that this core material is practically not reco@@ ver@@ able .

B ) nuclear @-@ material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ produced , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a is@@ ot@@ ran@@ kon@@ centr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is about 80 % .
upon request of the community liber@@ ated the organization nuclear material that would otherwise be governed by these securing measures , provided by these securing measures , if the entire , due to this article in the states are not at any time more than
a ) total of a k@@ ilo@@ grams of special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :

the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by @-@ Kredit@@ agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tors , if the banks provide an appropriate request .
the agreement could be closed until the total amount of the credi@@ tors to the mechanism paid to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2,@@ 725 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future income tax funds of member states .
already now , however , some conditions may be called to its application the BI@@ S would be ready .
at any stand@@ by credit credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without that it has been exc@@ eeded for a total of five years .
when opening the loans , as well as with its possible extension the BI@@ S would have a credit cr@@ ying .
in addition , the first civilians were not agreed before exp@@ ir@@ ation of a month after completion of the stand@@ by @-@ agreement , the bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liqui@@ dity .

the terms of conditions would correspond to which the BI@@ S are committed to the respective conditions at similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would correspond largely to the market &apos;s market .
