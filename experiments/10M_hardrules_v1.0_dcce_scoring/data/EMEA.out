this document is a summary of the European public public@@ ity report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is explained as the committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to discuss recommendations regarding the application of medicines .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the pack @-@ line ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tray ( tablets that can be in mouth ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ector solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ling thinking and Spre@@ chen , Hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or see of things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ king @-@ I @-@ disorder , a psychological condition in which the patients have man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des ( periods and periods ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of heavy to severe man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and the prevention of man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in patients who have addressed in the past in the past .
the injection solution will be applied to the fast control of st@@ ables or behavi@@ our@@ al problems when the or@@ ale intake of medicines is not possible .
both diseases can take the solution to take on or mel@@ ting the mel@@ ting tray for patients with which the sl@@ ing of tablets could be prepared .
patients who have to take other medicines the same as A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of ner@@ ve cells with each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol probably works mainly as a parti@@ eller Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amin and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ xis just like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and D@@ op@@ amine , but in inferior size as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters affects the recept@@ ors .
since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , contributes to the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms are reduced and their re@@ visions will be prev@@ ented .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the re @-@ occur symptoms , was investigated in three studies about up to one year .
the efficiency of inj@@ ecting solution was compared to the patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which suffered an un@@ disturbed un@@ disturbed , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in a further study A@@ bili@@ fy over twelve weeks in 347 patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo which were re @-@ occur to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the eff@@ ic@@ acy of A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ uri@@ al solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in the symptoms experienced by patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment .
the company also led studies by investig@@ ating how the body mel@@ ting the mel@@ ting tray and the solution to take resp@@ or@@ bit ( ceas@@ ing ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in dos@@ es of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.75 mg or 15 mg , a significant increase in symptoms un@@ disturbed un@@ rest as the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
the application for treating bi@@ polar disorder has decre@@ ased a@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five c@@ zz@@ ar studies more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy covers up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo the res@@ ili@@ man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des in previously treated patients and when it was in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg dos@@ es decre@@ ased also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .

the committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) , at the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy episode in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and in which the man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ xis said , opposite the risks .
moreover , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ uri@@ al solution in rapid control of disturbed un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des at Bi@@ et@@ op@@ hr@@ enia , if an or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission of the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eu@@ tical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is shown for the treatment of moderate up to heavy man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des and their man@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ep@@ zol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness of dos@@ ing over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dosage .
the recommended dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as Mon@@ otherapy or composite therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ oc@@ op@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initi@@ atory dose , if clinical factors this justi@@ fy these ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ in@@ duction from the combination therapy is set to be reduced the Ari@@ as pra@@ zol dose for the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ en@@ vis@@ ually behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treating Ari@@ pi@@ os@@ zol ( see section 4.8 ) .
outcomes of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder has no increased risk to Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ benzene in comparison to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol should be proj@@ ected with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovas@@ cular diseases , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic disease , conditions , which is intended for hyp@@ ot@@ ony pre@@ de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blo@@ ody per@@ me@@ tic medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including audi@@ ting and mal@@ ign@@ ing form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that have been a year or less continuous , there were occa@@ sional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if at one with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y patients signs signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ati@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esth@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dosage or to break the treatment .
when a patient signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns to indicate , or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , will be set .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol should be used in patients with scr@@ amp@@ ors in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are associated with scr@@ amp@@ ors .

however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fix@@ ing dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the approach for un@@ wanted un@@ contam@@ inated events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ es or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em or death , was reported in patients suffering with at@@ y@@ pical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no precise risk evaluations for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ie @-@ related un@@ wanted events with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ y@@ pical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , the direct link .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of the gl@@ uc@@ ose values .
a weight increase in general at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ens patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic medication is known to which weight increase as side effect , and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol on the Central nervous system is bew@@ are , if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ xis are taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as Se@@ mer ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agonist of Fam@@ oti@@ din , a Mag@@ ens@@ ä@@ ure @-@ Blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ p@@ action of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol , however this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically .

it is expected that other high @-@ effective in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ed constructions .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abo@@ isi@@ ans can result the common application with highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ alised compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ext@@ ensi@@ tive Met@@ abo@@ isi@@ ans .
if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail over the potential risks for the patient .
other high @-@ effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , can have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ed constructions .
after gradu@@ ating of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be raised the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y at the beginning of the esc@@ ort therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 shared with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , can be counted with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ st@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies showed dos@@ es of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abo@@ lic of the sub@@ str@@ ings of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ph@@ an ) .
the patient should be recommended to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or have a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol .
due to the in@@ sufficient data base for the safety when people and due to the Re@@ production studies may not be applied to this medicine in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits does not justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be war@@ ned that dangerous machines , including fuel vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ xis have no negative influence .
the following side effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) on than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) :

Abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European public@@ ity report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is explained as the committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to discuss recommendations regarding the application of medicines .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ c@@ ament ) is not shown together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Dual@@ therapy ) .
it can also be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be accomplished with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dosage .
in combination with a Sul@@ fon@@ ts or In@@ s@@ ulin can be kept the old dose of Sul@@ fon@@ ts or the In@@ sul@@ ins with the beginning of Ac@@ qu@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic treatment , except for patients with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( Low blood flow ) ; here the dosage of the Sul@@ fon@@ ts or the In@@ sul@@ ins are reduced .
this means that the bodi@@ ment of your own ins@@ ulin are better utilized and the blo@@ od@@ le level decre@@ ases which type @-@ 2 diabetes is better set to adjust type @-@ 2 diabetes .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy , in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a Sul@@ fon@@ ts , in addition they received up to 3,5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed her@@ b , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood flow is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it easier that the blood pressure values are reduced to the application of dos@@ ing of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a Sul@@ fon@@ ts in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Values um 0,@@ 94 % , while the extra hub of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and In@@ s@@ ulin in 289 patients has been studied in addition to In@@ s@@ ulin , a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values of 0,69 % after 6 months compared to the patients who were in addition plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper brea@@ ths ( Erk@@ ed@@ és ) , weight increase and hy@@ po@@ esth@@ esia ( ver@@ min@@ ated sensitivity against tire ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used to be applied in patients , which may be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , her@@ cin@@ ante or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ wers - sec@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ egel - in the blood ) .
it has decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the only use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment of met@@ form@@ in patients should serve , in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 ert@@ eil@@ ed the European Commission of the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited has a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until white , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combination with In@@ s@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood flow in@@ sufficient and in which met@@ form@@ ulation is un@@ suitable because of con@@ tra @-@ indications or intoler@@ ances ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on for patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endang@@ ered by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart disease ) or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dosage and enhance the dosage schedule .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a her@@ cin@@ ante , weight gain or ov@@ aries , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ovas@@ cular reserve .
the patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a her@@ cin@@ ante , to be observed and observed by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ ovas@@ cular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ y in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ cular disease was performed .
in this study there was an increase in reports about her@@ cin@@ ante , but what did not lead to an increase in the Mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with an increased compensation ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the Nor@@ m@@ enri@@ s ) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
when the AL@@ T @-@ mirror is increasing to the 3 @-@ purchase of the upper limit of the north @-@ range , the liver li@@ sters are once again to control as soon as possible .
if a patient &apos;s symptoms developed to point out on a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as uns@@ ett@@ ty , fatigue , fatigue , appe@@ tite , and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver li@@ vel@@ i@@ ties to review .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continued , should be headed by the laboratory parameters of clinical trial .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ y , a dos@@ ed @-@ dependent weight can be proven and in some cases linked to a liquid level .
as a result of an hem@@ op@@ ution came under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a reduced reduction of the middle her@@ mo@@ unds ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and of the ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ ri@@ ts ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in a compar@@ ative trial studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients in met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ ian resin and In@@ s@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the her@@ etic ) and In@@ s@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the her@@ es@@ her@@ um at 1 @-@ 2 % and of the ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ ri@@ ts around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased in@@ sul@@ ins@@ ensi@@ tivity in patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale or triple therapy with an Sul@@ fon@@ ts or triple therapy with ins@@ ulin gene therapy with ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .

the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ In@@ du@@ ector ) result in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ buted to that using pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decre@@ ased by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which decre@@ ased by the mother of hyper@@ ins@@ cription and increased In@@ sul@@ ph@@ ous membran@@ e and thus reduce the availability of the met@@ abo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ates for the red@@ dish growth .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones br@@ igh@@ ten are used ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause at which a risk is made for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking another medicine ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vitamins ) .
to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the food order , the patient should take place until after the first intake of the day , the early ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet is not hin@@ ge .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already approved separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , put the company data from earlier studies and the published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 682 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D @-@ sp@@ read@@ ed .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D mirror in patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who were solely ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data against that , that in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE enth@@ alt@@ ed Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose exactly the dosage is required for the prevention of a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of motion apparatus and symptoms of diges@@ tive apparatus , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ings ) , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ings ) , rep@@ ented di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( be@@ amed stomach ) , displ@@ aced ab@@ dom@@ en ( bor@@ row@@ ed stomach ) as well as Sau@@ res .
in patients with possible hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tivity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components must not be used AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
it may not be applied in diseases of food supply , with patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ Flem@@ ie ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand at least 30 minutes or sit down .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission called Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
capsule form , white to broken white tablets , marked with the layout of a gar@@ lic on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or take on pharmaceu@@ ticals ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vitamins ) for the day .
the following hints are exactly to follow , to reduce the risk for comp@@ iling irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is supposed to be s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not turn the tablet into the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ timo . • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the ear@@ liest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. zzy Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal blood or surgical interventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal batt@@ les except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ thalm@@ ale reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ iti@@ s , mal@@ oph@@ thalm@@ ologi@@ al cor@@ rec@@ tions , rarely followed by mal@@ oph@@ onic cor@@ rec@@ tions , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly were these mostly primarily and required a hospital assignment ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms resulting in potential mal@@ oph@@ thalm@@ ology reactions and patients should be pointed to be pointed out in the appearance of symptoms or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ ing sor@@ eness or new or to merge the medicines ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ oph@@ onic side effects seems to be increased in patients which the medicines will not take correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that will take on a mal@@ oph@@ onic irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing instructions to be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large sc@@ ented studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk has been established , have been rare ( according to market management ) Mag@@ ni@@ et and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ ol , including some of them mainly and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
Oste@@ o@@ ek@@ boys of the Ki@@ ef@@ ers , usually reported in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ iti@@ s ) , has been reported for cancer , whose therap@@ ists has been practic@@ ed mainly intra@@ ven@@ ous Bis@@ ph@@ osph@@ ere .
there is no data available to inform you whether the re@@ placing a bis@@ ph@@ osph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a ki@@ osk surgical procedure to di@@ min@@ ated the risk of a ost@@ ensi@@ on@@ ment of the ki@@ ef@@ ers .
clinical assessment by the doctor &apos;s treating patients is author@@ it@@ ative for therapy planning on the basis of an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients should be dependent upon receipt of taking a dose of taking part of the dose of taking a dose for the next morning after they have noticed their failure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to take no two tablets per same day but the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned to continue the week@@ day .
other diseases which can affect the metabolism ( like vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ oth@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ tism ) , should be treated before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE also ad@@ qu@@ ire .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , Ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicine can affect the Res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ ac@@ uation studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in clinical trials was taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without a clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions appeared .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is intended only for use at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore should neither apply during pregnancy nor of nurs@@ ing women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fatty acids or post@@ nat@@ ale development .
Oste@@ op@@ pres@@ ets of the Ki@@ ef@@ ter has been reported in patients under Bis@@ ph@@ osph@@ ere ; but most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also reported at ost@@ e@@ opor@@ osis .

in the two @-@ year @-@ extension of these studies held the classification of the BM@@ D by sp@@ ine and Tro@@ ch@@ anter continues ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was sustained .
fit consi@@ sted of two plac@@ ebo studies where al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily on 2 years and then 10 mg daily will continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study reduced the daily G@@ abe of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at the appearance of at least one new sp@@ frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7,@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .

da Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ g@@ force already implemented in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously performed studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ g@@ raft as well as data published in the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented to the patients with levels of levels , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ g@@ raft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in .
the main inde@@ xed of the effectiveness has been the number of patients in which the tran@@ splan@@ ts was canc@@ eled after a treatment duration of a year ( by example , such as often a renewed organ@@ tran@@ spl@@ ant or rest@@ oring the di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) .
in addition , further studies have been carried out on 119 patients with kid@@ ney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with living tran@@ spl@@ antation and investig@@ ates like Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ g@@ force by the body .

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ o@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant sp@@ ati@@ veness , this drug should arrange or make changes in the immun@@ o@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically @-@ relevant differences of the system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m this can lead to tran@@ splan@@ ts or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ o@@ soup .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ tic form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; outlines the form@@ ulation or of the regime should only be made under the nar@@ rated control of an in the tran@@ spl@@ ant of medical physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of an switch to an alternative wording , a therapeutic cl@@ amps and appropriate dosage adjustment be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of waste and compatibility in individual cases ( see below &quot; recommendations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ tic level should be controlled by the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 was the system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure , measured as a tal@@ ents , with both formulations both at Ni@@ er@@ - and in the living @-@ tran@@ splan@@ ts patients .
careful and re@@ peti@@ te checks of the tac@@ tic tal@@ ents are recommended during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant in Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure reasonable substance ex@@ position in the immediate post @-@ tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
da Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m a substance with low clear@@ ance is , can take a adaptation of the Adv@@ ent Dos@@ is@@ sch@@ ema several days until the ste@@ ady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase accepts no or@@ ale intake of medicines , the tac@@ tic treatment of intra@@ ven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concent@@ arte for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) are initiated with a dosage of ca .
duration of the application of t@@ ur repression of tran@@ splan@@ ts needs to be maintained by the immun@@ soup ; consequ@@ ential treatment can therefore not be specified a maximum duration of the or@@ atory therapy .

dos@@ ing adap@@ t@@ ations in special patients suffering patients with reduced the functioning of blood tal@@ ents in the targeted field can be required for patients with severe life @-@ dys@@ functions in a dosage of dosage .
patients with reduced level function Da the kid@@ ney function has no influence on the phar@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic tac@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , it can be excluded , that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical potenti@@ als , however , is a careful monitoring of the kid@@ ney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ ver@@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ mar@@ bles , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ear@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) .
conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f when changing from an Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a tac@@ tic @-@ based therapy is recommended to care ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on tal@@ ents in full level the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of waste and compatibility of full @-@ blo@@ od@@ ly tac@@ tic controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the tac@@ tic tal@@ ents during the first two weeks after tran@@ spl@@ ant checks , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c checks during the treatment therapy .
blood level of tac@@ tics should also change according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dos@@ ing adap@@ tion , changes to the immun@@ o@@ supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in the simultaneous use of substances which may change the Tac@@ ch@@ li@@ m g@@ om@@ mus which are checked ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f a medicine with a low clear@@ ance is , adjustments to the dose of several days until the ste@@ ady state entered .
the data in clinical trials allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the tal@@ ents in blood 20 n@@ g / ml not exceed .
in clinical practice the tal@@ ents of tac@@ tic operations in the first time after living tran@@ splan@@ ts in the first time after living in@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts in the range from 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in kid@@ neys - and warm @-@ plan patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
while the fil@@ ing therapy of liver , kid@@ ney and cardi@@ ovas@@ cular diseases were usually used blo@@ od@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe un@@ wanted un@@ wanted events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ tic form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; outlines the form@@ ulation or of the regime should only be made under the nar@@ rated control of an in the tran@@ spl@@ ant of medical physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .

due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a flo@@ ating of tac@@ tic mirror in the blood and an At@@ ten@@ uation of the clinical effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , the taking herbal supplements ( hyper@@ tension perfor@@ ated ) , or other plant c@@ eil@@ ed during treatment with Adv@@ oc@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö is a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations in the blood since the tac@@ tic blood levels may be ref@@ used under such circumstances .
in rare cases it was under pro@@ gra@@ f as a car@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y Kam@@ mer@@ ing or s@@ ept@@ um hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur even under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ician distur@@ ban@@ ces , are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ tical ost@@ ero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kid@@ ney or liver functional dys@@ functions , infections , liquid assets and heating .
as with other Immun@@ o@@ supp@@ res@@ va , the effect of sun@@ light or UV @-@ light because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant changes due to suitable clothes or using a sun protection is restricted by means of a high level of protection .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of blo@@ od@@ ations in patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ related , blo@@ ody blo@@ ody distur@@ bing ) .
the dosage and incidence of the application are according to whether adv@@ ate for the treatment of bl@@ eeding or to the prevention of blo@@ od@@ ations in surgical intervention .
patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII @-@ lack , which causes blo@@ ody problems such as blo@@ ody in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from Men@@ plas@@ ma , but according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human Ger@@ der factors VIII .
Adv@@ ate is one of the other in the European Union un@@ approved medicine named ir@@ bin@@ ate , but similar , but the medicine does not contain proteins humane or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to medium sized h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of pharmaceu@@ ticals was investigated as well as in surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ent was awarded in the prevention of blood cells in 86 % of 510 new blood ep@@ iso@@ des with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are schi@@ p@@ del , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies compared to factor VIII .
Adv@@ oc@@ ate may not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against the human Ger@@ der factor VIII , mouse , or Ham@@ or protein , or any of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission called B@@ ax@@ ter AG an approval for the transport of Adv@@ oc@@ ate in the whole of the European Union .
dosage the dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ labour , according to the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient .

injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the danger to the patient is above .
during the treatment process , the control of inj@@ ections and the frequency of inj@@ ections is a proper determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and indicate different half times .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of blood cells in patients with severe h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given dos@@ es between 20 and 40 i.@@ E. by factor VIII per kg weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor of VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ instreaming cannot be reached or if the blood is not domin@@ ate with a reasonable dose , a test must be done to prove a inhi@@ bit@@ or .
in patients with high In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ evaluate , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be wo@@ und@@ ed .
the inj@@ ectable vel@@ ocity is to be directed after the reference of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exc@@ eeded .
the formation of neut@@ ron @-@ bodies ( inhi@@ bit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known compact instrument in the treatment of patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII gr@@ ated Ig@@ G Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins that are in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plas@@ ma by modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say quanti@@ fied .

based on the initial data provided on the initial data , the CH@@ MP risk has continued to be assessed as well as positive , but considering that the security profile must be monitored within the following reasons :
therefore the CH@@ MP on the basis of the Security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the fil@@ ing owner has to apply extra charge in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited European Committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched its application for approval by Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , the breast , the brain , the bones or the wheat ( tissues which connects other structures in the body and hing@@ es ) of it .
this is a kind of virus that gene@@ tically modified gene@@ tically , that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus , &quot; that was so changed that there cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in the human being .
Adv@@ exin could have re@@ juven@@ ate directly into the tum@@ ors and should allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein that is formed from the un@@ def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ Gen , usually bears the recovery of cor@@ rupt DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be reco@@ vered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , with whom the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen def@@ ect is , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not correct , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study with a patient before the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the field of sub @-@ construction , into the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP , the answers of the company on the asked questions were checked , there were still some questions uns@@ ol@@ ved .
based on the review of initial documentation created by CH@@ MP on Day 120 a list of questions that is sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP view of CH@@ MP was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore offers benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of medicines using the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of medicines .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ exin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company put the CH@@ MP not of that if the withdrawal of consequences for patients has currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ c @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed effectiveness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective ingredients instantly and the other slowly gets released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seas@@ onal Rh@@ initi@@ s ( Heu@@ schn@@ ing , caused by all@@ ergy to con@@ gen@@ ed infl@@ amm@@ ation of the nose @-@ cycle ) in patients with r@@ hin@@ et@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous nose ( hidden nose ) .
for adults and you@@ ths from 12 years the recommended dose of Aer@@ ina@@ ze is twice a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the Nas@@ en@@ et@@ eim@@ age ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of over 10 days is not recommended because the effects of medicines can be used on con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main scale of the dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hy@@ po@@ etry pl@@ omas that reported from patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients describe their symptoms all 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluated with a standard scale , how heavy symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the hy@@ po@@ dro@@ pl@@ omas except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ina@@ ze was reported about a withdrawal of symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in the patient , the P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the r@@ end@@ omet@@ ri@@ um was considered , the patients under Aer@@ ina@@ ze has shown an all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % towards 26,@@ 7 % in the patient , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ die ( cardi@@ ovas@@ cular ) , An@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( infl@@ amm@@ ness ) , con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness , fatigue , ins@@ om@@ never ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( bat ) , sle@@ eves and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze may be applied in patients , which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ al effects or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine to treat allergi@@ es ) are not to be applied .

on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission called the company SP Europe offers a permit for the transport of aer@@ ina@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is in the whole to s@@ wal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ash or to cr@@ ying ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used due to mis@@ conception and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application to 10 days because in long @-@ term use the activity of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time .
after decrease the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous in the upper brea@@ ths , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .

this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tical activity in combined application of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ cular diseases such as Bro@@ mo@@ id , cab@@ ot@@ amin , cab@@ ine mon@@ opol@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine , Phen@@ yl@@ ep@@ hr@@ in , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient treatment and the data are not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and the effectiveness of aer@@ ina@@ ze were not tested in patients with kid@@ ney or living @-@ functioning and the data are not enough to discuss appropriate recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment in appearance of a hyper@@ tension or a T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or from Pal@@ u@@ ations , cardi@@ ac disease , nau@@ sea or any ampli@@ fiers or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be set .
when treating the following patient groups , patients under Dig@@ ital@@ is • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with Hyper@@ ton@@ ie • patients with a m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ant in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ stering or bron@@ chi@@ d .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to implementation of mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise can prevent positive reactions on indicators to prevent skin response or to their extent .
in the context of clinical trial with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which y@@ ar@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition , however , no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine observed .
in the results of the psychological tests , no significant differences between the lor@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the associated with plac@@ ebo patients were determined , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken .
this for the met@@ abo@@ lic of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in whose enzy@@ mes was not yet identified so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded completely .

the in@@ concei@@ vable of the use of aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected rows , however , no increase in frequency of mis@@ form@@ i@@ ties compared to frequency .
since Re@@ production studies in animals are not always transmitted to people and is not used on the vas@@ cular properties of P@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , the patients should be clari@@ fied in a rare cases that it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to an assignment of traffic or ability to use machines .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ eing , Ap@@ no@@ e , decre@@ ased spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , Kom@@ a , cardi@@ ovas@@ cular coll@@ ap@@ ery ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , Tre@@ m@@ or , con@@ vul@@ tures ) with potential let@@ ells .

limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at the age of 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mit@@ ory of the intervention ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous crane required and may be finished after the end of the symptoms and resume their res@@ ign@@ ments .
the Persian Rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the aller@@ gie@@ time a continual treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not established in the scope of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets were not noticed where y@@ ar@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced in simultaneous intake of a@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be clari@@ fied in the cases that it can be reported in very rare cases that can lead to an assignment of traffic or ability to use machines .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic ur@@ anium and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects , more than the more common than at plac@@ ebo reported were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , m@@ outh@@ dry ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 578 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect of head@@ aches , these entered into 5,@@ 9 % of patients infected with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6,@@ 9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study , when up to 45 mg of lor@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ chy dose ) have been observed , no clinical relevant effects have been observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the sub@@ stitution of pro@@ infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory cy@@ c@@ uses as IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of the ex@@ position of the Ad@@ h@@ et@@ sion@@ board P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ in on End@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells .
as part of a clinical study with multi@@ disciplinary study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cular effects described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ parall@@ eled dosage ) over ten days ago , there was no extension of Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ c@@ alls .
in a single dos@@ ing study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measuring ranges , including the strengthening of subjective pun@@ ching or the tasks that are connected with the filling .
in patients with allergic reactions , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ sec@@ re@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , it@@ ch and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch on the pal@@ ates .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ enni@@ al , may be allergic to the duration of symptoms resulting from the duration of symptoms also in inter@@ mit@@ igation of allergic Rh@@ initi@@ s and Persian rh@@ et@@ ape .
inter@@ mit@@ igation of the rh@@ et@@ ape will be defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
Pers@@ isti@@ s allergic Rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as the signing of the Al@@ ts@@ cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire to the quality of life at Rh@@ ino con@@ j@@ unc@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis was described , decre@@ ased a@@ eri@@ us effectively that is highlighted by seas@@ onal Rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria studied ad@@ minist@@ ered for other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophy@@ si@@ ology is imper@@ ative the ap@@ ti@@ ology in the different forms and can be easier to sp@@ ectively recru@@ its .
since the hist@@ am@@ in@@ ser@@ tion is a compul@@ sive factor in all its ur@@ ic diseases , is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also confirmed in other forms of urine , in other forms of urine patients to improve the symptoms . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was effective in improving pre@@ judi@@ itus and the flo@@ wering of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dos@@ si@@ ties .
as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , in chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria became the minority of patients that does not depend on anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ formed from the study .
an improvement of the j@@ ump@@ ed by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and the wax level , as by a 4 @-@ point scale to evalu@@ ating these variables .
in an Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which were comparable to the patients @-@ Dem@@ o@@ graphi@@ es with the general seas@@ onal Rh@@ initi@@ s population , was achieved at 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no requests for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .

the pres@@ cri@@ tic doctor should be aware that most cases of Rh@@ initi@@ s will be caused by children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is required to assist the treatment of a inf@@ ectious recovery with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of the upper resp@@ ir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es should play a role in diagnosis the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratories and skin form@@ ations .
approximately 6 % of adults and children from 2 to 11 years met@@ al@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see under section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children from 2 to 11 years , which is restricted met@@ abo@@ ze , is identical to the children of the normal met@@ abo@@ lic .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not noticed in the scope of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets do not noticed where y@@ ar@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study has been reinforced in simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall side of side effects in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic ur@@ anium and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic , have been reported more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi@@ disciplinary study of adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , while up to 45 mg of lor@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ een dose ) have been observed , no clinical relevant effects have been observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who came for an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ in@@ therapy in question received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( at the age between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic Rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar to increase sperm data from des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults to the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multiple adults and adol@@ esc@@ ents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily on 14 days , no statis@@ tically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovas@@ cular effects described .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ til@@ ted dose ) over ten days for adults was shown , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people for protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause before an strain of influ@@ enza virus that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks from when a new strain of influ@@ enza virus that can be easily spread from man to man because the people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine recogni@@ zes the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; bodi@@ ly virus as &quot; bodi@@ ly &quot; and forms anti@@ body against it .
thus , the immune system later is able to form a contact with a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus this st@@ am@@ ms faster anti@@ bodies .
subsequently the membran@@ e envel@@ ope of the virus with the &quot; wa@@ iter @-@ scale &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ e surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ alien ) , as well as a component of the vaccine .
a inspection of some of the study entr@@ es that the study was not conducted in accordance with &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine would not come to meet the demands of the guidelines of the E@@ ME@@ A for pre@@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .

it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are being infected with human@@ ic immun@@ o@@ we@@ ather@@ virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are acquired acquired Immun@@ e Def@@ ici@@ ency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot cope with the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be heard when the doctor has checked the anti@@ vir@@ al medicines of patient previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood is judged that the virus will speak to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ are according to the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decre@@ ases in combination with other anti @-@ virus medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS cannot cure , however , can , however , the p@@ ests of the immune system and thus also the development of associated with AIDS and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti @-@ vir@@ al medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies , in two main studies , which previously had been treated with Prot@@ ected numbers .
that were compared with low do@@ si@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken by 206 adults who had earlier Prot@@ eas@@ ers formerly compared to other Prot@@ eas@@ ants .
main inde@@ xed to the effectiveness of the patients were the proportion of patients with non @-@ binding concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of the Vir@@ us@@ last after the treatment .
in the studies of patients who had previously taken no Prot@@ ected former patients after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a Vir@@ us@@ last below 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
with children decre@@ ases A@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us@@ last but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ector numbers , only very few to treat the treatment .
in the study with adults who had been treated with Prot@@ ected numbers , they have been treated with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other proteins .
in patients with HIV , that was resistant to four other protein fr@@ ighten@@ er , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a greater waste of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as with the patients who participated their previous proteins .
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed if more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ings ) , nau@@ sea ( Bl@@ essed ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , break @-@ down , r@@ ash and fat@@ ality ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ative must not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase is also not used in patients who are cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplements to treat depression ) or medicines that are just as A@@ gener@@ ase and are being harmful in high concentr@@ ations in the blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking up in patients who are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( de@@ grad@@ ation of bone tissue ) or a immune e syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection , which are caused by the reco@@ vered immune system ) .
the committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) , at the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ asy are used in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years opposite the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee asked that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ are in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously won &apos;t be ref@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , since the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 str@@ ing@@ te the European Commission of the company Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited has a approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- , Prot@@ eas@@ s@@ mer ( PI ) for the treatment of adults and children over the age of 4 .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are intended to be applied to the pharmac@@ ist Boo@@ adding of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r together with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration the individual vir@@ al Resi@@ stance and the treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the availability of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take place is 14 % less than by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to take on a Mill@@ ig@@ r@@ amm is not inter@@ change@@ able ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 . when A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the reinforced edge of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ adding ) , must be applied higher dos@@ es to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg weight twice daily in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not exceed ( see section 5.1 ) .
the Phar@@ mak@@ e@@ ine@@ tic , effectiveness and security of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ ected numbers were not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to error detection and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose of A@@ gener@@ asy capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver functional dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be done with patients with more easily or moderate @-@ functioning working with caution in patients with severe liver , it is cont@@ ra@@ zed ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with pharmaceu@@ ticals , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements which are Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ tension perfor@@ ated ) may not be used due to the risk reduction of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a healing of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be applied together with low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic Hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al Com@@ bin@@ ary therapy , have a raised risk for heavy life @-@ inter@@ actions with potentially fat@@ al course .
in the case of con@@ current anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of h@@ ep@@ atitis B or C please read the question of the information contained in this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ reduced liver function , including a chronic @-@ active h@@ ep@@ atitis show an increased incidence of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r changes with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other Gl@@ uk@@ ok@@ or@@ tik@@ oid , it is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of a treatment the risk system@@ ic kor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ i@@ der Eff@@ ect including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ depend@@ able ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the duplic@@ ation of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ t Lov@@ ast@@ at@@ ine and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ at@@ ine is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended in simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ at@@ in and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ at@@ in due to the increased risk of Mi@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen not recommended .
4 . for some medicines , can cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , as Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and War@@ mb@@ in ( under monitoring the International Nor@@ mal ratio ) , are available methods to identify the effect of the effect .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abo@@ lic inter@@ actions with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r may be the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal con@@ cave , however , the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , patients should be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of a tox@@ icity due to the high Prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ on@@ ism of the A@@ gener@@ ative solution to hold is this Dar@@ ing form in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a r@@ ash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic sympath@@ ies ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including Prot@@ eas@@ ed therapy , was reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ propri@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medications needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ y .
B. higher age , and with pharmaceu@@ ticals dependent factors , such as a longer and@@ au@@ ern@@ al anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abo@@ lic disorders .
at h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ector numbers , there are reports of an increase of blood cells including spont@@ aneous ut@@ ut@@ aner Hem@@ at@@ oms and Hä@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ in@@ infected patients with serious imm@@ def@@ ective therapy ( ART ) can develop a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous infections , which leads to severe clinical supplements or deteri@@ oration of sympath@@ ies .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial ether is adopted ( including application of cor@@ tical repression , alco@@ hol@@ iness , heavy Immun@@ o@@ supp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ M@@ ass @-@ index ) , were reported cases of ost@@ on@@ ek@@ asis in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al Com@@ bin@@ ational therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with pharmaceu@@ ticals , which have a small therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with pharmaceu@@ ticals , whose effects are mainly related to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , and for the increased Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction of AU@@ C by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r causes that can lead to an vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resident development .
at the try , the de@@ grad@@ ation Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel by a Dos@@ is@@ increase of other prot@@ ease inhi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were observed very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver .
Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ icum offic@@ atum ) Die Ser@@ en@@ spiegel by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r can be de@@ grad@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ tension perfor@@ ated ) .
when a patient already arrived at Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ kr@@ aut , the am@@ pr@@ en@@ a@@ virus mirror and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and the Joh@@ an@@ nis@@ cr@@ aut .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ um@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz down ) .
508 % increases , for C@@ max on , if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which anim@@ ate the effectiveness and in@@ compreh@@ ensi@@ bility of this treatment .
52 % discount when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were obtained in combination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
a met@@ ering recommendations for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is not recommended above , as the effectiveness and in@@ compreh@@ ensi@@ bility of this combination is not known .
there was no phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the application of A@@ gener@@ osity in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however is recommended due to the ant@@ ac@@ acia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , the hub of E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dos@@ ing adap@@ tion needed .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the Ex@@ position of both proteins .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other Prot@@ ected and existing data stored , that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ or may be sen@@ i@@ avi@@ ation by Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , care is offered , since Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din because of the decre@@ ased or maybe sub@@ therapeutic plastic mas@@ ks less effective could be less effective .
if these medicines will be applied together ; a thorough kl@@ ay and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done since an accurate forecast as well as the combination of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous G@@ abe of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in the plas@@ ma cent@@ ric measurement ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in to 193 % and thus to an increase in connected with Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in side effects .
if it is needed for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ gener@@ ase becomes a reduction of dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
Phar@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with y@@ ar@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted , however , the plastic mas@@ ks of both medicines will be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ ap@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole has led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in Plas@@ ma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 11 ) on the 2,@@ 69@@ C once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , shirts or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be applied to tox@@ ic reactions that are associated with these medicines , if they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ector , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can become resolutions .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ oni@@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as a enzy@@ ab@@ duc@@ tors ( Phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arb@@ ital , Carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r may lead to a de@@ grad@@ ation of the plastic level of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r .
the Ser@@ um @-@ concentr@@ ations of calcium @-@ alb@@ ot@@ ea , di@@ odi@@ pin , Nic@@ ol pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ im@@ odi@@ pin , pin , thus increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these medicines .
the simultaneous intake associated with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations and with PD@@ E5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in connection @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ rate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significant , while the end@@ ogen@@ e cor@@ ti@@ sol around 86 % devi@@ ate ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous occurr@@ ences of A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic Cor@@ re@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ tions , such as Lov@@ ast@@ at@@ ine and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ at@@ ine , whose closures are strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronoun@@ ced enh@@ ancements of the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel in simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
da Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ pel@@ ines of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er to My@@ opath@@ y , including an R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of this medicine with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it will be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabili@@ zation the mirror , since the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ation of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be applied together with or@@ ally bi@@ or@@ em Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while maintaining the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am with other Prot@@ eas@@ els show on a possible increase in the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel of Mid@@ az@@ ol@@ am around the 3- up to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one stands together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially if there are also low dos@@ es of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per cent small loading of historical compar@@ isons , there is no recommendation to be given as the am@@ pr@@ en@@ a@@ vir@@ al dose is to be adjusted when Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on .
in simultaneous occurr@@ ences of War@@ mb@@ in or other or@@ ec@@ ular anti@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en together with A@@ gener@@ ase becomes an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ mal ratio ) because of the possibility of ton@@ ing or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ ing effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal counter@@ tra@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predic@@ table , therefore , so alternative methods for recep@@ tive prevention is recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of Tri@@ cy@@ cli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the same gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy during pregnancy only according to the possible impact of the potential risks for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ acks , Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into the mother &apos;s milk .
a Re@@ production @-@ action plan which was given from the entrance to the uter@@ us to the end of down@@ time Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r , showed during the down@@ time a ver@@ min@@ ated increase in 12 post@@ al &apos;s weight .
the further development of the comm@@ union including fertili@@ zation and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the in@@ concei@@ vable of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied with adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different other anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ effects associated side effects were easy to moderate , occurred early and led rarely to the treatment .
in many of these events it is not clear if it is used in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other simultaneously to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying diseases .
most of the above side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 30@@ 01 , PRO@@ AB@@ 3006 ) , in which with Prot@@ eas@@ ants were not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .

the conclusions regarding the Rel@@ ational percentage of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to modifications by additional data and it is recommended always to move the current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyse the results of resistance tests .
based on ph@@ än@@ ot@@ yp@@ ic Resi@@ st@@ otic resistance systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ ot@@ yp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations of the activity of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ector @-@ resistant insul@@ ators .

each of these four with a decre@@ ased sensitivity against Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r affili@@ ated gene@@ tic patterns creates a certain cru@@ de @-@ resistant to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ um@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains in general .

one hundred @-@ three @-@ six@@ ty ( s = 163 ) patients with thoug@@ ht@@ ful virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part @-@ stage of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .

the cover of the effectiveness of in@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV inf@@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take up and capsules in dos@@ es of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ zed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the with PI @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the along with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study included a Plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ R@@ NA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with an medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output .
19 Basi@@ cally on these data should be considered in therapy with PI @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after the administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is the average duration ( T@@ max ) to maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ max on the other hand , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of the res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ parall@@ eled penetration of am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration in Plas@@ ma , whereby the amount of un@@ born am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r which represents the active portion , probably unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ broken am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of the free active component in the Ste@@ ady concentration of ste@@ ady concentration in Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .

the hub of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r ex@@ position as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ b@@ able than from the capsules ; therefore the A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negl@@ igi@@ ble , therefore , the effect of a kid@@ ney @-@ b@@ bing to the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be small .

24 When A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the reinforced edge of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ adding ) , must be applied higher dos@@ es to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r / kg weight twice daily in combination with other anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pr@@ en@@ avi@@ r that should not exceed ( see section 5.1 ) .

the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in an rand@@ om@@ ised , double fl@@ ran@@ ate phase @-@ 3 @-@ study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were re@@ produced for the study conducted the total health @-@ spectrum services , the majority of patients were raised in the middle @-@ type of crane and only a patient pointed to the heavy phenomenon .
patients were re@@ fresh if they had a for@@ ged exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage of the expected change of the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ - o@@ test .
all patients were subsequently received for an open @-@ label extension , where she received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me received .
after 26 weeks of therapy , those with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group , improving the lung function and the in@@ capacity to be represented in the following table .
the open extension provides an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown from the following table .
the dis@@ appoint@@ ing of the year @-@ saving FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased to propor@@ tionally proportional to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ ac@@ it@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of G@@ AG mirror was established in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constantly to the degree of study .
with regard to h@@ et@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous crane standards between the patient , which has been taken into account by using a combined assessment of cross @-@ law firm ( with expected percentage of a combined field @-@ depth ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a year @-@ year @-@ 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and phar@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic discovery of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me at 20 patients were examined , which were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with the heavy stor@@ ey form and 4 with the middle dec@@ im@@ print form ) .
for four patients the dosage due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror recorded in the Har@@ n in the Har@@ n week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .

A@@ lim@@ ta is not treated in patients who have previously been treated in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than ever before .
to reduce side effects , patients should take care during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of Vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta together with Cis@@ plat@@ inum , should be before or after the gift of Cis@@ plat@@ in addition to a &quot; Anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicine to v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent a liquid gel ) .
in patients whose blood cells change or occur in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be dis@@ described , or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and R@@ NA and prevent the cells to share cells .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into his active form goes more easily on cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of drugs by means of a longer period of cancer in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ig@@ ence Pl@@ eur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms was studied A@@ lim@@ ta in a main study on 456 patients who had not received any chem@@ otherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ clinical lung cancer , the effect of A@@ lim@@ ta has been treated with local advanced or metastatic disorder , which previously had been treated with an chem@@ otherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also were compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( another medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study on 1 725 patients who had not received any chem@@ otherapy for lung cancer .

to reduce the frequency of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin respon@@ dents must be given on the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as on the day after treatment a cor@@ tical ost@@ con@@ id .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fol@@ ds and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also have a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular inj@@ ecting Vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ cg ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage , as well as after every third operator cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created in front of every gift , including a differenti@@ ation of the Leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ ence .

at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dosage adjustment has to take place under the tox@@ icity of the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood or the maximum non @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous treatment .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are treated for ALI@@ M@@ TA as Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 Blut@@ ung .
should patients do not develop @-@ h@@ et@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA will be interrupted until the patient is the value before the treatment

clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years , or in comparison to patients aged 65 years of age a increased level of risk @-@ risk @-@ risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to not rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of the data for un@@ belief and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dosage adjustment needed to go beyond that for all patients recommended dos@@ ing adap@@ t@@ ations .
the template for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients were examined by the 1.5 @-@ purchase of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Grenz@@ ences and / or Trans@@ am@@ inas@@ much ( in the re@@ vocation of liver attack ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ increments of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metastatic bats ) not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored in view of the gar@@ lic soup and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before the absolute neut@@ ron &apos;s value should be back up a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ lin@@ ders again reaches a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ att@@ ained .
a dos@@ ing reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ ron factor , Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ lin@@ ders and maximum non @-@ h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity , as it has been observed in the prec@@ eding cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a smaller tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 h@@ ä@@ mat@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ eth@@ ic tox@@ icity such as neut@@ ral@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ ral@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ o- , when a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients must be dependent , fol@@ ds and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ y- lak@@ tical measure to be applied to the reduction of tox@@ icity of tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with easy to medium kid@@ ney disease ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must prevent the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ al Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required , taking the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value time for at least 5 days before the therapy , at the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events entered , appropriate risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including Deh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , pre@@ fabric@@ ation of the blu@@ e@@ print or Diabetes .
therefore , with patients with clin@@ ician liquid assets - accumulation in trans@@ cell@@ ular space a dra@@ inage of erg@@ ises in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ treatment .
5 massive cardi@@ ovas@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ant , and cerem@@ onial studies were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this effect is usually issued in combination with a different cy@@ lo@@ ox@@ ical effects .
for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ated life expect@@ ancy ( excluded , this vacc@@ ination is cont@@ ra@@ ined ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of mis@@ ir@@ reversible sli@@ ce of the re@@ productive capacity of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should men should be pointed out of the treatment of treatment , consultation with regard to the sperm activation .
in patients with normal kid@@ ney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dos@@ es ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decre@@ ased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed re@@ inde@@ xed to result of a multip@@ lic@@ ing of side effects .

Alo@@ xi is used at Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong manifestation for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( like Cis@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as at chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate vi@@ ability for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are ( like Cy@@ clo@@ ph@@ osph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Carb@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be used by the extra gift of an Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the use of patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group not enough information .
this means that the effect of the cou@@ plings of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) to prevent the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults , which are chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which have strong or moderate ex@@ ecu@@ tives for nau@@ sea and break .
at chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and break are , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
at chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate vi@@ ability for nau@@ sea and un@@ break are , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi where 24 hours after chem@@ otherapy ( 153 by 189 ) , towards 69 % of the with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
with a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission of the Company established in Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ eu@@ ticals Ltd. became an approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed to the prevention of ak@@ able nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at strong em@@ eto@@ gen@@ er chem@@ otherapy due to cancer patients and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting from even@@ em@@ eto@@ gen@@ er chem@@ otherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi regarding the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting which is in@@ duced by a strong em@@ eto@@ ous chem@@ otherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the chem@@ otherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids .
da Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ ment , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ scher Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ gl@@ uten I@@ le@@ us after the injection machine .

besides associated with another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi is supposed to neither be used in the days after chem@@ otherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical trials tre@@ m@@ ated Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron the against tum@@ ors of the five sub@@ stitutes of chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ ph@@ osph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ph@@ osph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ous interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady met@@ ric met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
in one based on a pop@@ ulation @-@ based pharmac@@ ist analysis has been shown that the simultaneous G@@ abe of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( Ami@@ o@@ vian , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Ch@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ch@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences to the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are not available to human pregnancy , therefore , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied by pregnant , unless it is necessary by the doctor as necessary .

in the group with the highest dosage showed similar resi@@ des of un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose to be observed .
no Di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the great distribution of di@@ aly@@ sis but is probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ us over@@ dose .
in two rand@@ om@@ ised dou@@ bl@@ ind@@ rical studies , have been compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ op@@ ard@@ ine , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ ph@@ osph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given in day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason intra@@ ven@@ ous .

the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ V. acqu@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in retail outlets from 0.25 , 0,75 and 2.25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption by intra@@ ven@@ ous G@@ abe follows an initial consultation of the plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations a slow Eli@@ mination from the body with an average termin@@ al half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area below the Con@@ centr@@ ation @-@ time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0- ∞ ) are generally included in the entire dos@@ es@@ range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ . kg at Heal@@ thy and cancer .
after intra@@ ven@@ ties of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 dos@@ es lay at 11 Ho@@ den@@ cardi@@ ac average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron s@@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ric at 42 ± 34 % .
from phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations is that at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ties of 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has been comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0- ∞ ) with which according to unique intra@@ ven@@ ous value was comparable ; however , the C@@ max after admission of 0.75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated with the kid@@ neys and about further 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abo@@ lic item which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies on met@@ abo@@ lic studies have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in low dimensions , which are I@@ so@@ enz@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the met@@ abo@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
Eli@@ mination After a intra@@ ven@@ ous Single dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found about 80 % of the dosage within 144 hours in urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as in@@ variable effects made about 40 % of the given dose .
according to a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ usin@@ esses , the overall body volume ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
though in patients with severe liver functioning the termin@@ ale eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ an@@ age and the average system@@ ic Ex@@ pos@@ ure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of dosage is therefore justified by it .
in clinical trials , effects were observed only according to ex@@ positions which are regarded as adequate over the maximum human@@ istic expres@@ sions , which indicates a little relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ eding studies refer to that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , only in very high concentr@@ ations , who are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
high dos@@ es pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dosage talked in about the 30@@ s of therapeutic cl@@ position at people ) , which were given every day over two years , led to a simpli@@ fied frequency of Ne@@ opl@@ as@@ ms ( in Th@@ y@@ ro@@ id , Pan@@ cre@@ as , Co@@ cre@@ atic mark ) and skin cav@@ ort at r@@ atten , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood , but due to the used high dos@@ ing and since Alo@@ xi is determined at a unique application , the rel@@ ational of these results is as low as for the human being .
the owner of this permit has to inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport , within the scope of this decision approved by pharmaceu@@ ticals .

June 2006 passed the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) , in which the dispatch of approval for the transport of Hep@@ atitis C is recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same phar@@ ma cutting effective component should be approved which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; Reference phar@@ ma . &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ standing ) Hep@@ atitis C ( one due to a virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ian examination , the living @-@ tissue damage , in addition are the values of the living @-@ enz@@ ym@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood decre@@ ased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon placed data against the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and pur@@ ity of medication by means , effects , safety and effectiveness at Hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study on patients with h@@ ep@@ atitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference quart@@ z by means of 455 patients .
in the study , how many patients were measured from a total of 48 therapies and 6 months after adjustment of treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of virus in blood ) .

moreover , concerns are uns@@ ur@@ ned that the data for the stability of the drug and the market @-@ market medicines have not been sufficient .
the number of patients with h@@ ep@@ atitis C , which spoke to treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
according to the treatment of the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease has more patients back on the reference quarter , and also had al@@ ph@@ eon more side effects .
aside from that the study was referred to to the inquiry , in@@ wi@@ ew@@ age the drug is an imm@@ unity ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ body - special proteins - against the drug ) dis@@ solved , not sufficient vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pet@@ igo ( one with Kru@@ sten@@ o @-@ her@@ ed skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or cutting edge ) , ton@@ ed and gen@@ ed wo@@ unds .
Alt@@ ar@@ go will not be used to treat infections , or pres@@ um@@ ably by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ R@@ SA ) , because Al@@ ar@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect .
Alt@@ ar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 may be to be treated as treat@@ able skin surface not more than 2 % of the body surface .
when the patient speaks after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient once again and consider alternative treatments .
it works through block@@ ade of bacter@@ ial Ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacter@@ ial which are produced in which proteins ) and inhi@@ bited the growth of bacteria .
the main inde@@ xed of the effectiveness has been carried out in all five studies the proportion of patients , their infection after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Alt@@ ar@@ go and 37 ( 52.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo talked to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected jan@@ it@@ ers showed Alt@@ ar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin similar response rates : if the results of both studies have been mer@@ ged into account , about 90 % of the patients of both groups to treatment .
in these two studies were however observed that Alt@@ ar@@ go during the treatment of ab@@ sz@@ ty@@ ards were caused by th@@ ink@@ ers or by infections that were prev@@ ented or pres@@ um@@ ably by M@@ R@@ SA have not been effective enough .
the common@@ est side effect with Alt@@ ar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
the committee for Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) introduced to the conclusion that the benefits of Alt@@ ar@@ go to the risks of super@@ ficial skin infections on the risks are excessive : • Im@@ pet@@ igo , • in@@ authentic@@ ated small Laz@@ ations , ton@@ ed or gen@@ ed wo@@ unds .
may 2007 , the European Commission called Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . an approval for the transport of Alt@@ ar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients suffering from two to three days no bet@@ tering shows , should be considered once again and be considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a Sensi@@ tiz@@ ing or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is broken down , the sal@@ is carefully res@@ onate and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections at which M@@ R@@ SA is known or assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ R@@ SA ) , in@@ sufficient .
an alternative treatment should be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment no bet@@ tering or a deteri@@ oration of the infected point .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the low plas@@ tic@@ on@@ centr@@ ations that were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on ab@@ ed skin or in@@ infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant shirt in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) .

Ambi@@ rix is used for the protection against Hep@@ atitis A and Hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) among children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not imm@@ unity against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within the framework of a two cans of existing vaccines , whereby one protection against Hep@@ atitis B could only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of h@@ ep@@ atitis B infection and is assured that those consisting of two dos@@ es existing vaccines can be brought to an end .
if a refres@@ her colony against Hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another Hep@@ atitis A or -@@ B vaccine is given .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; how it can rise up against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognize the viruses and super@@ ficial an@@ ig@@ ene as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates anti@@ body against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as those since 1996 approved vaccine for Twin@@ rix adults and the same since 1997 @-@ approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vaccines are applied for the protection against the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are listed as part of three cans of existing vacc@@ ination .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults are included , some of the data that included the use of Twin@@ rix adult , also used as a letter for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main inde@@ xed for the effectiveness was the share of the great children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ monthly distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the elderly children a month after the last injection and development of anti @-@ bodies against Hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix during a six @-@ month and at a 12 @-@ monthly distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , p@@ pe@@ tit@@ an@@ gel , pain on the injection point , red@@ ness , Matt@@ ness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) and matur@@ ity .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients , which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) to the ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission called Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ s.@@ s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the Stand@@ ardi@@ um plan for the Pri@@ mers and Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose of the appointment and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dosage is extended .

since a intr@@ ad@@ er@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the gh@@ ug@@ ly lead to a sub@@ optimal im@@ perf@@ ume could be avoided this injection paths .
at Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood @-@ bal@@ ances , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ compar@@ atively sub@@ k@@ ut@@ an inj@@ ected as it can be found in these cases in in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift .

in a clinical study , which has been through with 3 vaccines in this wording , was the frequency of pain , pipes , sw@@ elling , Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ iti@@ s , head@@ ache , Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ iti@@ s , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver comparable to the incidence that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccines .
in clinical trials we were given the vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix at a total of 1027 be@@ ers at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared with the 3 @-@ dos@@ es com@@ bin@@ ational material .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and Matt@@ y on a calculation base per vacc@@ dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 7 % of pro@@ ban@@ den compared to 39.@@ 1 % at the pro@@ ban@@ den after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dos@@ es com@@ bin@@ ational material .
after the complete vaccines reported 6@@ 4 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den , the ambi@@ rix had enough to get over pain , from 6@@ 3.6 % to the pro@@ ban@@ den , which were lab@@ elled with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ ar com@@ bin@@ ational .
the frequency of Matt@@ eness was similar per pro@@ band comparable ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination at 39.@@ 6 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den , the ambi@@ rix had been compared with 36.@@ 2 % in the pro@@ ban@@ den that received the 3 @-@ dos@@ es compositions ) .
the frequency of ra@@ inf@@ ant pain and Matt@@ eness was low and comparable to , which has been observed after administration of the Com@@ bin@@ ational sim@@ pler with the 3 @-@ dos@@ es vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study with 1- to 11 @-@ year &apos;s vacc@@ inations was the appearance of loc@@ al@@ reactions and general reactions to the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group , with the 3 @-@ dos@@ es compositions with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activ@@ ated Hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis B @-@ Ober@@ fläch@@ em@@ atic Hep@@ atitis .
for the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year , however , after vacc@@ ination , however , after vacc@@ ination was a common appearance of pain ( at the injection point ) per dosage , not per pro@@ band .
the share of vacc@@ ination that reported on heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ dos@@ es vaccines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dos@@ es vaccine connected with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activ@@ ated Hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis , was statis@@ tically not different .
in clinical trials that were carried out during vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ igrap@@ hic betra@@ yed for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 pro@@ gresses dose ( d. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ ver@@ sus rates for anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 pro@@ gres@@ sed dose ( d. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study that was carried out at 12- up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old , we received 142 two cans ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard com@@ bin@@ ational material with three dos@@ es .
with the 289 people whose imm@@ unity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ating advise ( SP in the table below ) against Hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 to G@@ abe of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ pf@@ ei@@ es significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune answers that have been achieved in a clinical trial period in 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ year a month after ending the full vaccines ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations either received a 2 @-@ dos@@ es vacc@@ sch@@ ema with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dos@@ ages vaccine with 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activ@@ ated Hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hep@@ atitis B .
for individuals who were at the time of the pri@@ mer between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s @-@ anti@@ bodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vaccine .
in this study wat@@ ched immune re@@ tion against both Ant@@ ig@@ ene was comparable to the vacc@@ ination of 3 dos@@ es with a comp@@ bin@@ ational material , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activ@@ ist Hep@@ atitis A @-@ surface and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ ep@@ atitis in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12- Top up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old , that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s @-@ anti@@ bodies compared to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ months vaccine .

you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a blue face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( gels ) and other symptoms which may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines you can not fully protect an infection with h@@ ep@@ atitis or h@@ ep@@ atitis B virus , even if the complete vaccines have been completed with 2 dos@@ es .

a protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms , which are similar to those according to a h@@ ep@@ atitis or h@@ ep@@ atitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by ju@@ st@@ ating skin or tongue . • If you have encoun@@ tered an allergic reaction to a former vacc@@ ination against Hep@@ atitis A or h@@ ep@@ atitis B . • If you have / your child has a heavy infection with fe@@ ver .
• If you want to have a protection against h@@ ep@@ atitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and usually issued the administration of the second vaccine ) .
with a possible risk of infection with h@@ ep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will give you a child of a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ ep@@ atitis B vaccine with a reduced content of an efficient component per vacc@@ ination of an formal Hep@@ atitis A @-@ virus and 10 m@@ cg of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ ep@@ atitis B level ) .
the second vacc@@ dose of this vaccine has reduced to effective sal@@ ary and usually passed a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination before ter@@ mination of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from the skin and not cut into the muscle tissue . • if you have / your child due to a disease or treatment in your / its bodi@@ ment resistance , / is or if you have / your child attrac@@ ts a her@@ b .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the imm@@ unity of those persons on vacc@@ ination can not be adequate , so a blu@@ e@@ est can be required to see how strongly reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 S@@ ign your doctor if you have / your child up further medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have received your child recently gotten / became or imper@@ ative bul@@ ins ( anti@@ body ) or has been planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the imm@@ unity on the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both h@@ ep@@ atitis A and B viruses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be given to separate bodies and as possible different li@@ mb@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix ends at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Im@@ m@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine would be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix oscill@@ ations or nurs@@ ing women is not enough except it is urgent that it will become more against Hep@@ atitis A as well as Hep@@ atitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( anti@@ bi@@ otic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known for issu@@ ing the first approval for the transport industry , the CH@@ MP view that the benefits risk for Ambi@@ rix starts positive .
since Ambi@@ rix had only been launched in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data is limited to this medicine due to the low patient @-@ position .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used for patients aged over a month with in@@ complete resource def@@ ective or with hyper@@ opia or hyper@@ tension ) in the history .
Am@@ mon@@ y is divided - split into several items of meals - s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed , among the food mixed or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l ( by the ab@@ dom@@ en in the stomach leading tube ) or a r@@ hin@@ gen Sensor ( by the nose in the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ do not have to be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ medi@@ ter@@ ament , d. h. without drug ) could be compared .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to Ap@@ pe@@ tit@@ enne , a snor@@ ing , stim@@ ulus , stim@@ ulating , taste , har@@ ness , decor@@ ating , nau@@ sea , r@@ ins@@ ure , r@@ ash , in@@ uncomfortable body or weight increase .
the committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) introduced to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ y in patients with disorders of ur@@ inary cycle is preventing too high levels .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since due to the Sel@@ ten@@ derness of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine .
the application is manif@@ ested in all the patients indic@@ ator when a complete amount of Enz@@ or has already manif@@ ested in Neu@@ geb@@ or@@ enen@@ old ( within the first 28 life @-@ age ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete Enz@@ ymers , who is manif@@ ested after the first life itself ) then there is an indication for the use if in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ish spongiform encephalopath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to wal@@ low tablets or for patients with sl@@ u@@ ck@@ dys@@ functions is AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated by taking into account the proteins @-@ toler@@ ances and the development and development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the recent clinical experience is the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in Her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ph@@ osph@@ or@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ an@@ lin or ar@@ g@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ats@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase lack must Arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be extended patients with sl@@ u@@ ck@@ dys@@ functions , since a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ sion@@ ists where tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be proj@@ ected in patients with conventional Her@@ cin@@ ante or serious kid@@ ney disease , as well as with so@@ dium of so@@ ret@@ ention , and oil education in@@ trac@@ ted states only with caution .
since met@@ abo@@ lic and retirement of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at on the liver and the kid@@ neys , should AM@@ MONA@@ PS in patients with liver or kid@@ ney disease only be used with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore cont@@ ra@@ zed ( see 4.3 ) .
with subtle gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate at young vines ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal pro@@ pag@@ ation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a del@@ usion of cer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decre@@ ased number of functional Ner@@ ven@@ end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is in humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason is the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the nurs@@ ing time ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trial with AM@@ MONA@@ PS stood at 56 % of patients at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and for 78 % of these undes@@ irable events have gone out that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able tox@@ ic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 years old an@@ or@@ ectic patient , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , pan@@ zy@@ top@@ ia , peri@@ ph@@ ans N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y and Pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose came with a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler over a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler of 10 g ( 1370 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate that showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ ing neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lic active connection that is used by ac@@ et@@ y@@ elling with gl@@ ut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine that is left over the kid@@ neys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative car@@ riers of in@@ sufficient nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of ur@@ inary system can be accepted that for all grams are so@@ dium so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the excess of survival and clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born phases was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids inside the first life year to death .
through Hä@@ ber@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative paths of the nit@@ ric but@@ terflies ( Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ) , prot@@ ested reduction , and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of re@@ conciliation at post@@ parties ( but within the first life of life ) .
patients who were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and were treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ish spongiform encephalopath@@ y , but even in these patients , it was with time for many of mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ est form of the disease ( including female patients with the h@@ et@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ in@@ tran@@ sc@@ ary ( def@@ ect ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ish transmis@@ sible spongiform encephalopath@@ y and a prot@@ est diet was treated with the survival rate 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are also very reversible for treatment and with some patients may occur a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical gi@@ veness .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ i@@ ded leads to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate which is used in liver and kid@@ ney enz@@ ym@@ atic with gl@@ ut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abo@@ lic in plas@@ ma and urine were determined by so@@ ber of 5 g of so@@ dium of so@@ dium of so@@ dium of so@@ dium as well as re@@ peti@@ tive gifts of up to 20 g / day . ( not controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abo@@ lic has also been studied with canc@@ ers according to intra@@ ven@@ ties of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate .
after a oral individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form were 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plastic centr@@ alised by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ lin@@ ders or ha@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ien ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / Day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after coming fast@@ ing no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in Plas@@ ma .
for three of six patients with living s@@ sh@@ orts that have been treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three sep@@ er@@ osen ) , the middle Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ at@@ so@@ ils in the plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel on the third day fifty times higher than after the first gifts .
retirement The drug is transported within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ red mus@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us @-@ tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with tox@@ ic and non @-@ tox@@ ic dos@@ ages ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 up to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who do not have any tablets , or patients with sl@@ u@@ ck@@ dys@@ functions ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l or a r@@ hin@@ gen Sensor .
according to the recent clinical experience is the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ born baby , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in Her@@ an@@ growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , g@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially ench@@ co@@ qu@@ ette amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in plas@@ ma should be kept inside the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of Carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ph@@ osph@@ or@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ sc@@ arb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ an@@ lin or ar@@ g@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , accordingly 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ tions was susp@@ ended before the birth phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain .
a prob@@ able tox@@ ic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from a 18 years old an@@ or@@ ectic patient , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine , pan@@ zy@@ top@@ ia , peri@@ ph@@ ans N@@ europ@@ ath@@ y and Pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative car@@ riers for retirement of surplus value .
based on investigations on the retirement of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine in patients with disorders of ur@@ inary cycle . it can be accepted for any grams of so@@ y@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ yl@@ gl@@ ut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
existing neuro@@ logical defects must be hardly reversible , and in some patients may occur a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical gi@@ veness .
after a oral individual dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plastic centr@@ alised by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of growing patients with &quot; ac@@ ute cor@@ on@@ ary cor@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decre@@ ased blood circulation in the heart ) , e.g. at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or M@@ yo@@ k@@ ard@@ inf@@ ancy ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a an@@ om@@ al measurement at electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ graph or EC@@ G ) .
will an@@ gi@@ ox applied to prevent blood circulation in patients who under@@ go a higher dosage , and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with Ang@@ ina or ac@@ coun@@ c@@ ation to maintain blood flow toward the heart and increase the effectiveness of an PCI .
approximate 14 000 patients took part in the main study of the treatment of ACS at all over the treatment of ACS @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different drug was compared to the prevention of blo@@ od@@ ds and a G@@ PI .
while PCI became a patient ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ ter@@ ie , in order to prevent a cl@@ asp and they received in addition other medicines to prevent blood circulation , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac or Rev@@ is@@ ular@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year a total of just as effective treatment .
in patients who have been under@@ gone up to one PCI , ent@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all the indicators were just as effective in case of heavy blood cells , where it was significantly more effective than D@@ epar@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other sh@@ ud@@ ins or other components .
it may not be applied in patients which recently had a bl@@ eeding , as well as with people with strong blu@@ e@@ print or severe kid@@ ney problems or a heart infection .
the committee on Human@@ arz@@ nei@@ x ( CH@@ MP ) introduced to the conclusion that an@@ gi@@ ox during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ ess replacement for hol@@ o@@ in is .
September 2004 , the European Commission of The Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd is an approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with ak@@ uten Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ ing inf@@ ancy ( IA / NS@@ TE@@ MI ) ) on an emergency unit or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ al dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ ts of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is carried out a PCI one should be given an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery on 1,75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI can resume the reduced inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ us@@ ement of 0,5 mg / kg can be extended , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the entrance .
the recommended Dos@@ age of angi@@ ox in patients with one single @-@ intra@@ ven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ement of 0.75 mg / kg weight and one to directly subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous Inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of an all@@ eged Bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ts should be made from 0,3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ pro@@ stitute should be carefully mixed up and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly intra@@ ven@@ ous .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dosage is correct correctly .
in patients with key kid@@ ney @-@ capacity ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , treated one PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used to be a lower inf@@ usion of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
the ACT value under 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ dosage of 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again .
in patients with medium @-@ serious kid@@ ney , which were included in Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PL@@ ACE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value 5 minutes after the hub of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adap@@ tion at the average 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kid@@ ney ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and even with di@@ aly@@ sis patient is all@@ gi@@ ox ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be 30 minutes after ter@@ mination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of un@@ f@@ ath@@ i@@ ously she@@ et@@ ate in or 8 hours following the sub@@ trac@@ tors of lower H@@ epar@@ in .

Ap@@ i@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ esc@@ ents and children from six years of age with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .

diabetes is an illness when the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regul@@ ate the gl@@ uc@@ ose control ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin cannot be effective .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in diff@@ ers very slight of human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and a shorter effect is considered a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Apple i@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot be ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with young children aged between four and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , when the body ins@@ ulin not effective , ap@@ i@@ dra was investigated in a study with many adults .
the main inde@@ xed to the effectiveness was the amend@@ ment of the concentration of the substance gly@@ co@@ y@@ li@@ zed her@@ b . ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how good of blo@@ od@@ ds is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ pro .
in case of adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0,@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ i@@ dra compared to 0,30 % in humane standards .
Apple i@@ dra should not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ensi@@ tive ( allergic ) against In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .

Apple i@@ dra is known as sub@@ k@@ ut@@ ane injection either in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ en , of the tor@@ ch or of the Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els , or sub@@ mitt@@ ing by continuous inf@@ usion on the area of the ab@@ dom@@ ination for appli@@ ences .
due to the reduced Gl@@ u@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ ic capacity and the decre@@ ased in@@ sul@@ inst@@ ation of the In@@ sul@@ in@@ requires in patients with one limitation of the liver function .
any change of the effect , the brand ( Her@@ - per@@ former ) , the In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp@@ s ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delay , etc . ) , the type of in@@ sul@@ ins ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the in@@ sul@@ ph@@ s .

the conversion of a patient to another In@@ sul@@ int@@ yp or an ins@@ ulin another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ie depends on the effects of the used In@@ sul@@ ine and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment process .

studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that on sub@@ ut@@ aner Ga@@ ill@@ ation of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the impact occurs faster and the effect of shorter than at hu@@ ber@@ ins@@ ulin Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .

In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast impact as normal human ins@@ ulin and generates the full glu@@ ing effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data was apparent that at an application of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ pon@@ ed gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control will be reached as with human@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
