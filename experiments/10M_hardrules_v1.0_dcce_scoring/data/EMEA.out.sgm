<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public publicity report (EPAR) which is explained as the committee on Humanarzneix (CHMP), in order to discuss recommendations regarding the application of medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the pack-line (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tray (tablets that can be in mouth (1 mg / ml) and as injector solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and Sprechen, Hallucinations (hearing or see of things that are not present), Misstrust and madness; • Biking-I-disorder, a psychological condition in which the patients have manic episodes (periods and periods) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of heavy to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed in the past in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution will be applied to the fast control of stables or behavioural problems when the orale intake of medicines is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both diseases can take the solution to take on or melting the melting tray for patients with which the sling of tablets could be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who have to take other medicines the same as Abilify, should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of nerve cells with each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a partieller Agonist "for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamin and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripipraxis just like 5-hydroxytryptamin and Dopamine, but in inferior size as the neurotransmitters affects the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin at schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, contributes to the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms are reduced and their revisions will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the re-occur symptoms, was investigated in three studies about up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficiency of injecting solution was compared to the patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered an undisturbed undisturbed, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study Abilify over twelve weeks in 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo which were re-occur to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injurial solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in the symptoms experienced by patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies by investigating how the body melting the melting tray and the solution to take resporbit (ceasing).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significant increase in symptoms undisturbed unrest as the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">The application for treating bipolar disorder has decreased abilify in four of the five czzar studies more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify covers up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the resilimanic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), Akathisie (charity), starters (complexion), peeling (constity), overstepping (constity), overstepping (constity), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomoslessness, insomnever (Schlafdysfunctions) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee for Humanarzneix (CHMP), at the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify episode in the treatment of schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes on treatment with Aripipraxis said, opposite the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injurial solution in rapid control of disturbed unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at Bietophrenia, if an orale therapy is not suitable to prevail over the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission of the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is shown for the treatment of moderate up to heavy manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiepzol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness of dosing over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as Monotherapy or composite therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Biocop- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initiatory dose, if clinical factors this justify these (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-induction from the combination therapy is set to be reduced the Arias prazol dose for the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suenvisually behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treating Aripioszol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Outcomes of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder has no increased risk to Aripivbenzene in comparison to other antipsychotic medication.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be projected with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases, carcinogenic disease, conditions, which is intended for hypotony predehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with bloody permetic medicines) or hypertension (including auditing and maligning form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials that have been a year or less continuous, there were occasional reports on the treatment with Aripiprazol Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at one with ABILIFY patients signs signs and symptoms of a spatidyskinesthesia, should be considered to reduce the dosage or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient signs and symptoms developed on a mns to indicate, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medication, including ABILIFY, will be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used in patients with scrampors in the anamnese or at states that are associated with scrampors.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) associated with Aripids in patients with Psychosis who were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a raised stros in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixing dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the approach for unwanted uncontaminated events with Aripiprazol patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemic, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazies or hyperosmolarem or death, was reported in patients suffering with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk evaluations for hyperglycaemie-related unwanted events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents, the direct link.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipher, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of the glucose values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight increase in general at schizophrens patients and in patients with bipolar manie because of comorbidities, the application of antipsychotic medication is known to which weight increase as side effect, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the Central nervous system is beware, if Aripipraxis are taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as Semer (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist of Famotidin, a Magensäure-Blocker, reduces the Resorpaction of Aripiprazol, however this effect is not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy Probes a high-effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) the AUC by Aripiprazol on 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosed constructions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metaboisians can result the common application with highly effective Inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasticoncentralised compared to CYP2D6 extensitive Metaboisians.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4-Inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should prevail over the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective Inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV-Proteaseinhibitors, can have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosed constructions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After graduating of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised the dosage of ABILIFY at the beginning of the escort therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 shared with ABILIFY, can be counted with a moderate increase in Aripistol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolic of the substrings of CYP2D6 (Dextromethoran-ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patient should be recommended to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or have a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for the safety when people and due to the Reproduction studies may not be applied to this medicine in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits does not justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, with other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned that dangerous machines, including fuel vehicles, to operate, until they are sure that Aripipraxis have no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects are more common (≥ 1 / 100) on than under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled-term long-term study over 52 weeks began in patients who were treated with Aripistonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesthesia, compared with patients, which were treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo controlled-term longterm period over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripirate-treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term period, over 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients who were treated with Aripipraxis and 15,1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at Bieteen-I-disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripistocol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semoperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long period of period, over 26 weeks at a placebo controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripistepol- treatment and 15,7% for with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially potentially significant changes of routinemediously controlled laboratory parameters, taking no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Creases of the CPK (creatin-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of with Aripioszol patients treated compared to 2,0% of using placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side-side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their appearance also reported in the treatment with Aripipraxis, unwanted cerebrovvascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market leadership, unattended or abacute overdosing with Aripipraxis alone for adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Though, there are no information on the effectiveness of an hemognization in the treatment of an overdose with Aripipraxis; it is unlikely, that hemalysis is involved in the treatment of a overdose of beneficial because Aripipraxis have a high Plasmaple.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the effectiveness of Aripipraxis at schizophrenia and Biopotonism on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- Receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor as well as an excessive affinity to Dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenches and to the Histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In Size of Aripipraxis in dosing from 0,5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy Probanden showed a dosing dependent on the bond-dependent control of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor, at the nucleus ndatus and on Putin.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1.228 schizophrined patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo a statistically significant stronger improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-controlled trial, a week 52 of the share of the Responses of patients who have a approach to the academic mediation, in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement, which have been defined as secondary study, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depressions rates, showed a significant stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo controlled trial over 26 weeks on stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia was shown for Aripiprazol a significant reduction of the relitarian group, which lay at 34% in the Arias praetzol group and at 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled-controlled, multinational study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients are wider and in which the primary study sets (N = 18 or 13% of valuable patient sets) at least 7% compared to the output (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bieteen-I-disorder showed Aripiprazol a compared to placebo symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixing dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bieteen-I-disorder showed Aripiprazol on placebo no overlegal effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboats and active-controlled Monotherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed cluster, showed Aripiprazol a compared to placebo excessive effectiveness in week 3 and an encouragement effect that comparable was to be compared to Lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also pointed out in week 12 a comparative share of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania on like Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or painted style, with or without psychotic characteristics, which are partly over 2 weeks not on Lithium- or Valproat-Monotherapy when therapeutic treatment with Aripipraxis a superior effect in reducing symptoms related to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a longtime expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached with Aripipraxis during a stabilisation at placebo during a stabilisation toward placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar way, mainly in the prevention of a reverence into the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-trials, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for the dehydration and hydration of Aripioszol, the N-Dealkyrie is catardised by CYP3A4 catalysis.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination period is approximate 75 hours for Aripiping in extensic metabolic metaboisians over CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") Metaboisians about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">With Aripipraxis there are no differences in the Pharmakokinetic between male and female healthy Probanden, as well as in a pharmacist examination of schizophrener patients were not curved effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pope-specific evaluation of the Pharmaceuguinetik has no indication of clinical significant differences with regard to ethnic affiliation or the impact of the smoke on the pharokinetic Federation of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacist properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripipraxis were similar to patients with severe kidney sufferers compared to young healthy Probanden.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single-dose study at Probanden with a different graduation of the Lebanese kitchen A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the filling function of Aripipraxis and Dehydro in the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to the metabolic capacity to draw conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security-harassology, toxicity at repetitive gabe, Reproduktionstoxity, Genotoxicity and to the Canadian potential, the prekline data made no special dangers to the people.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects have been observed only in dosing or expositions which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to people so that they have limited to clinical use only limited or no meaning.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects includes a dosages independency on toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigmentation by humans) and / or Parenchkidney-State Department (AUC) during the recommended maximum occupancy by 60 mg / kg / day (the 10Simple the middle Steady-State-Exposition (AUC) during the recommended Maximaldose of man).</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type-2 diabetes (also known as insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in which metformin (a diabetesmedicament) is not shown together with another diabetesmedikament (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be accomplished with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a Sulfonts or Insulin can be kept the old dose of Sulfonts or the Insulins with the beginning of Acquglycemic treatment, except for patients with Hypoglycaemia (Low blood flow); here the dosage of the Sulfonts or the Insulins are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the bodiment of your own insulin are better utilized and the bloodle level decreases which type-2 diabetes is better set to adjust type-2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in Tripletherapy, in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a Sulfonts, in addition they received up to 3,5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood has been measured in the blood (glycosylized herb, HbA1c), which shows how well the blood flow is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which makes it easier that the blood pressure values are reduced to the application of dosing of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a Sulfonts in a reduction of HbA1c-Values um 0,94%, while the extra hub of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and Insulin in 289 patients has been studied in addition to Insulin, a reduction of HbA1c-values of 0,69% after 6 months compared to the patients who were in addition placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper breaths (Erkedés), weight increase and hypoesthesia (verminated sensitivity against tire).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used to be applied in patients, which may be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, hercinante or diabetic ketowers - securespiegel - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has decided that Actos in the context of a monotherapy (in the only use) as an alternative to the standard treatment of metformin patients should serve, in which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000 erteiled the European Commission of the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited has a permit for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also displayed for combination with Insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood flow insufficient and in which metformulation is unsuitable because of contra-indications or intolerances (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon for patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart disease) or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dosage and enhance the dosage schedule.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a hercinante, weight gain or ovaries, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">The patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a hercinante, to be observed and observed by pioglitazon in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazy in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced makrovcular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study there was an increase in reports about hercinante, but what did not lead to an increase in the Mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with an increased compensation (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the Normenris) or with other signs of a liver disease may not be used Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">When the ALT-mirror is increasing to the 3-purchase of the upper limit of the north-range, the liver listers are once again to control as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient's symptoms developed to point out on a hepatic dysfunction, such as unsettty, fatigue, fatigue, appetite, and / or darker harn, are the liver livelities to review.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with pioglitazon continued, should be headed by the laboratory parameters of clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazy, a dosed-dependent weight can be proven and in some cases linked to a liquid level.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of an hemopution came under the therapy with pioglitazon a reduced reduction of the middle hermounds (relative reduction by 4%) and of the haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in a comparative trial studies with Pioglitazon in patients in metformin (relative reduction of the hemian resin and Insulin (relative reduction of the heretic) and Insulin (relative reduction of the heresherum at 1-2% and of the haematocrits around 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulinsensitivity in patients who receive Pioglitazon as orale or triple therapy with an Sulfonts or triple therapy with insulin gene therapy with insulin-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">According to the market introduction, under the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, through a appearance or deterioration of a diabetic maculaodems with a reduction of visual acces.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether it is between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of Makulaödeaf a direct connection, but conflicting doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Makulaös, if patients should be considered as failures of the aspirations; a suitable ophthalmologic section should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports unwanted events regarding bone delusion of randomised, controlled, double fluskline studies have been treated with more than 8,100 patients suffering with pioglitazy</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture was 1,9 factures per 100 patient-years with Pioglitazon treatable women and 1,1 faculas per 100 patient-years in women who have been treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study over 3,5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, presented faculty at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 faculty per 100 patient-years) in patients treated with patients suffering from patients.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patios should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient is doing a pregnancy or that occurs, the treatment is disastrous (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazis no relevant effects on the Pharmaceutic ics or Pharmakodynamics of Digoxin, Wait, Phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interdependencies with drugs called by these enzymes, e.g. orale contrazeptiva, cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA-reducer are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) result in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon to the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-Induector) result in a reduction of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributed to that using pioglitazon which decreased by pioglitazon which decreased by the mother of hyperinscription and increased Insulphous membrane and thus reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single incidents: unknown (of these data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the Turgors and the braking indexed of the lens, as they are also observed at other hypoglycaemic effects.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon performed with Pioglitazon, ALT-stiege spread over the three-fold the upper limit of the north as well as under placebo but seltenders as in comparison groups under metformin or Sulfonts.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced makrovac disease was the frequency of a serious hercinante under Pioglitazon by 1,6% higher than under placebo if Pioglitazazel bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch of the launch, rare in Pioglitazon reports, however, if Pioglitazis reported in combination with insulin or in patients with floods in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">An summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding fractures from randomised, controlled, double fluskline studies conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the associated with Pioglitazon-treated groups and over 7,400 patients in the linked group.</seg>
<seg id="796">During over a period of 3,5 years of ongoing study, faculty at 44 / 870 (5,1%) of which were treated with Pioglitazon treatable, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients associated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on a activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) Proliferation / Receptor-to (PPAR-D), which leads in the animal model to an increased insulinsensitivity of liver, obesity and skeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazis reduced the Glucoseproduction in the liver and the periphers glucosity increases in case of insulpheral.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as Monotherapy was conducted over two years to examine the time until after the therapeutic effects (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 therapy).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy could be a bleeding control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo trial over 12 months, patients, their blood flow, despite three months optimising phase, with insulin-inadequate, to Pioglitazon or placebo randomised.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced, the mean hbA1c - value around 0,45%, compared to patients who continue to only be insulin; a reduction of the islanders in which were treated with pioglitazon treated group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year shown under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant impact of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotives in comparison to the output.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, on 18 weeks after referred to type-2 diabetikers.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials were observed compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma Triglyzeride and the free fatty acids, and a rise of the HDL- cholesterol levels, as well as little bit higher, clever increased LDL- cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials for a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid the overall plasmatriglyzeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterlevel.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was signed under Pioglitazon no statistically significant increase of LDL Cholestercholesterol levels, while in Metformin and Gliclazid obmined values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks reduced Pioglitazon not only the sober-Triglyceride but also improved the postprandial elevated Triglyceridmirror, this both about an effect on the Triglyzerid-absorption as well as on the hepatic Triglyzerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, were 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced makrovac disease in groups, in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After an application Pioglitazon quickly resorbiased, whereby the peak management at unaltered Pioglitazon in Plasma generally achieved 2 hours by application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis the contribution of M-IV for the effectiveness in about the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, while the relative effectiveness of M-II can be minimal pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interacstudies could be proven that Pioglitazis no relevant effect on the pharokinetic ics or Pharmakodynamics of Digoxin, Phenomenon, Phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-Induector), or lowers the plasticoncentration by Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to the use of radioactive selected pioglitazon by humans, the marker was found mainly in the fish (55%) and a little extent in the resin (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unchanging Pioglitazon amounts to people 5-6 hours, and which of the entire active metabolic is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plastic-centric lines of Pioglitazon and its metabolic are lower than with healthy Probances, whereby the rationale Clearance of the mother subtle but similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, vines, dogs and monkeys coincide after repetitive administration of plastic volume, anemia and reversing eccentric carditis.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributed to treatment with pioglitazon which decreased by pioglitazon in the bases of hyperinsulin and increased Insulphous membrane and thus reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for the reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced in the Rat of hyperplum (at male and female races) and tumors (at male Ratten) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other Proteasels show on a possible increase in the plasmaspiegel of Midazolam around the 3- up to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone stands together with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on Opiatentment symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per cent small loading of historical comparisons, there is no recommendation to be given as the amprenaviral dose is to be adjusted when Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous occurrences of Warmbin or other orecular antiulanzien together with Agenerase becomes an increased control of the INR (International Normal ratio) because of the possibility of toning or strengthening the anti-thrombing effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal countertraeptiva is not predictable, therefore, so alternative methods for receptive prevention is recommended.</seg>

<seg id="2326">With regard to heterogeneous crane standards between the patient, which has been taken into account by using a combined assessment of cross-law firm (with expected percentage of a combined field-depth), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A year-year-2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharokinetic discovery of Aldurazyme at 20 patients were examined, which were at the time of their recording in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with the heavy storey form and 4 with the middle decimprint form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">For four patients the dosage due to increased GAG- mirror recorded in the Harn in the Harn week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed to the prevention of akable nausea and vomiting at strong emetogener chemotherapy due to cancer patients and prevention of nausea and vomiting from evenemetogener chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi regarding the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong emetoous chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding one before the chemotherapy given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can extend the Dickdarmpassment, patients should be monitored with anamnestischer Obstipation or signs of a subgluten Ileus after the injection machine.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, with other 5babyantagonists, however, caution of Palonosetron has continued to extend the QT-Intervall or in patients with whom the Qt- Intervall is extended or that will be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides associated with another chemotherapeutics gift, Aloxi is supposed to neither be used in the days after chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials tremated Palonosetron the against tumors of the five substitutes of chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharynchronous interaction between a unique intravenous dosage of Palonosetron and a steady metric metoclopramids, an CYP2D6-Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one based on a population-based pharmacist analysis has been shown that the simultaneous Gabe of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiovian, Doxorubicin, Choxetine, Choxetine, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences to the use of Palonosetron are not available to human pregnancy, therefore, Palonosetron should not be applied by pregnant, unless it is necessary by the doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common with a dose of 250 microgram to obstructed side effects (total 433 patients) who at least possibly with Aloxi related, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity response and reactions on deserts (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing of experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed similar resides of unwanted events such as in the other dosages; there were no dose to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No Dialysis studies have been carried out due to the great distribution of dialysis but is probably no effective therapy with a Aloxius overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised doublindrical studies, have been compared with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisopardine, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Doxoretron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours), which was given in day 1 without Dexamethason intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In an randomised doublindly developed a total of 667 patients which were a strong emetoous chemotherapy, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbitamide and Dacarbitron, with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given to day 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with evenemetogener chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogener chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, cardiology and ECG parameters including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the preceding preceding studies of Palonosetron the ability to block the involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarisation involved and to extend the duration of the discount potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy Probanden study was the assessment of the ECG-effects of i.V. acquered Palonosetron in retail outlets from 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption by intravenous Gabe follows an initial consultation of the plasmakoncentrations a slow Elimination from the body with an average terminal half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasticoncentration (Cmax) and the area below the Concentration-time-curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally included in the entire dosesrange of 0.3- 90 μ. kg at Healthy and cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intraventies of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses lay at 11 Hodencardiac average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron sPlasmakoncentric at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharynokinetic simulations is that at once daily intraventies of 0,25 mg Palonosetron has been comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with which according to unique intravenous value was comparable; however, the Cmax after admission of 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated with the kidneys and about further 50% are converted into two primary metabolic item which have compared to Palonosetron over less than 1% of antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro-studies on metabolic studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in low dimensions, which are Isoenzme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at the metaboism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous Single dose of 10 microgram / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found about 80% of the dosage within 144 hours in urine, palonosetron as invariable effects made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">According to a unique intravenous Bolusinesses, the overall body volume ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Though in patients with severe liver functioning the terminale eliminationshalbanage and the average systemic Exposure with Palonosetron, a reduction of dosage is therefore justified by it.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In clinical trials, effects were observed only according to expositions which are regarded as adequate over the maximum humanistic expressions, which indicates a little relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preceding studies refer to that Palonosetron can block that Palonosetron, only in very high concentrations, who are involved in the ventricular De- and Repolarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses palonosetron (each dosage talked in about the 30s of therapeutic clposition at people), which were given every day over two years, led to a simplified frequency of Neoplasms (in Thyroid, Pancreas, Cocreatic mark) and skin cavort at ratten, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but due to the used high dosing and since Aloxi is determined at a unique application, the relational of these results is as low as for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The owner of this permit has to inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport, within the scope of this decision approved by pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="2650">• If any one of the listed side effects you have considerably impacted or you can notice side effects that are not specified in this usage information, please inform your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2651">• Aloxi is a clear, colourless injection solution for injecting in a vene. • This can block the effect of a serotonin which may result in a group of drugs called serotonin- (5HT3-) Antagonist and break down. • Aloxi will occur in the prevention of nausea and vomiting which occur in connection with chemotherapy because of cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 passed the Committee on Humanarzneix (CHMP), in which the dispatch of approval for the transport of Hepatitis C is recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon a biological medicine named Roferon-A with the same pharma cutting effective component should be approved which is already approved in the EU (also "Reference pharma.").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-standing) Hepatitis C (one due to a virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopian examination, the living-tissue damage, in addition are the values of the living-enzymms Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon placed data against the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of medication by means, effects, safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of alpheon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference quartz by means of 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, how many patients were measured from a total of 48 therapies and 6 months after adjustment of treatment to the drug (i.e. no signs of virus in blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Moreover, concerns are unsurned that the data for the stability of the drug and the market-market medicines have not been sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to treatment with alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">According to the treatment of the treatment with alpheon, the disease has more patients back on the reference quarter, and also had alpheon more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that the study was referred to to the inquiry, inwiewage the drug is an immunity (i.e. the body forms antibody - special proteins - against the drug) dissolved, not sufficient validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (one with Krusteno-hered skin infection) and small ininfected Lazerations (Rissor or cutting edge), toned and gened wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo will not be used to treat infections, or presumably by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo against this kind of infections may not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 may be to be treated as treatable skin surface not more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">When the patient speaks after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient once again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blockade of bacterial Ribosom (the parts of the bacterial which are produced in which proteins) and inhibited the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indexed of the effectiveness has been carried out in all five studies the proportion of patients, their infection after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected janiters showed Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies have been merged into account, about 90% of the patients of both groups to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies were however observed that Altargo during the treatment of absztyards were caused by thinkers or by infections that were prevented or presumably by MRSA have not been effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The commonest side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The committee for Humanarzneix (CHMP) introduced to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo to the risks of superficial skin infections on the risks are excessive: • Impetigo, • inauthenticated small Lazations, toned or gened wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission called Glaxo Group Ltd. an approval for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients suffering from two to three days no bettering shows, should be considered once again and be considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a Sensitizing or serious local irritation by the application of retapamulin Salbe the treatment is broken down, the salis carefully resonate and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections at which MRSA is known or assumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections that were caused by a methicillin-resistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA), insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative treatment should be considered, if after a 2- to 3-day treatment no bettering or a deterioration of the infected point.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasticoncentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on abed skin or ininfected superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant shirt in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="2693">Due to the low-system exposure to topical use in patients are dosiscustomizable not required when topical retapulin during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a Reproduction-stodification according to oral intake, and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and the fine / postnatale development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical anti-bacterial therapy is clearly indexed and the application of retapamulin use of an systemic biotic resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the Stillen continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continued, is between the benefit of breast for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of the patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was applied, the most commonly reported side-effect irritation at the end of agreement, which regard approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Effects Retapamulin is a semi synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by Fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (earlier Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective footage of bacterial protagonists by interacting on a particular weaving of bacterial Ribosom that differs from the Bindings of other ribosom inter-bacterial fabrics.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data would like to point out that the bond place ribosch protein L3 is involved and is in the region of the ribosom P-Bindings and of the Peptidyltransferring.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through bond at this liaison officers Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, block partly P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomic subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local prevalence of the Resistence of the use of retapamulin in at least some infectious forms, a consultation by experts should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin across S.aureus established, irrespective of whether the insure persensitive or resistant to methicillin were.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of an unappealing to the treatment of S.aureus should be considered the presence of tribes with additional Virulence factors (like PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for the protection against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) among children aged between 1 and 15 years which are not immunity against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used within the framework of a two cans of existing vaccines, whereby one protection against Hepatitis B could only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is assured that those consisting of two doses existing vaccines can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher colony against Hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another Hepatitis A or -B vaccine is given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "how it can rise up against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognize the viruses and superficial anigene as "foreign" and generates antibody against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as those since 1996 approved vaccine for Twinrix adults and the same since 1997-approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied for the protection against the same disease, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are listed as part of three cans of existing vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults are included, some of the data that included the use of Twinrix adult, also used as a letter for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indexed for the effectiveness was the share of the great children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine has been compared with a six-month and a 12-monthly distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of the elderly children a month after the last injection and development of anti-bodies against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix during a six-month and at a 12-monthly distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, ppetitangel, pain on the injection point, redness, Mattness (tiredness) and maturity.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients, which may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) to the ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which has been through with 3 vaccines in this wording, was the frequency of pain, pipes, swelling, Gastroenteritis, headache, Gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in the earlier Thiomersal- and preservative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials we were given the vaccination Ambirix at a total of 1027 beers at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix has been compared with the 3-doses combinational material.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and Matty on a calculation base per vaccdose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 57% of probanden compared to 39.1% at the probanden after the gift of a dose of the 3-doses combinational material.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccines reported 64% of the probanden, the ambirix had enough to get over pain, from 63.6% to the probanden, which were labelled with the 3-Dosar combinational.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of Matteness was similar per proband comparable (i.e. about the entire vaccination at 39.6% of the probanden, the ambirix had been compared with 36.2% in the probanden that received the 3-doses compositions).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of rainfant pain and Matteness was low and comparable to, which has been observed after administration of the Combinational simpler with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study with 1- to 11-year's vaccinations was the appearance of localreactions and general reactions to the ambirixgroup, with the 3-doses compositions with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B-Oberflächematic Hepatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11- year, however, after vaccination, however, after vaccination was a common appearance of pain (at the injection point) per dosage, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccination that reported on heavy side effects during the 2-doses vaccines with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine connected with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated Hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out during vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the Serigraphic betrayed for anti-HAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 progresses dose (d. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of the primer between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and Anti-HBs-antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">In this study watched immune retion against both Antigene was comparable to the vaccination of 3 doses with a compbinational material, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivist Hepatitis A-surface and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- Top up to 15-year-old, that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibodies compared to immunisation in the 0-6- months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0-12-months vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known for issuing the first approval for the transport industry, the CHMP view that the benefits risk for Ambirix starts positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix had only been launched in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data is limited to this medicine due to the low patient-position.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used for patients aged over a month with incomplete resource defective or with hyperopia or hypertension) in the history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammony is divided - split into several items of meals - swallowed, among the food mixed or via a Gastrostomieschl (by the abdomen in the stomach leading tube) or a rhingen Sensor (by the nose in the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammondo not have to be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a headmediterament, d. h. without drug) could be compared.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to Appetitenne, a snoring, stimulus, stimulating, taste, harness, decorating, nausea, rinsure, rash, inuncomfortable body or weight increase.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The committee on Humanarzneix (CHMP) introduced to the conclusion that Ammony in patients with disorders of urinary cycle is preventing too high levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary circumstances, since due to the Seltenderness of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is manifested in all the patients indicator when a complete amount of Enzor has already manifested in Neugeborenenold (within the first 28 life-age).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete Enzymers, who is manifested after the first life itself) then there is an indication for the use if in the anamnese a hyperammonish spongiform encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to wallow tablets or for patients with sluckdysfunctions is AMMONAPS also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated by taking into account the proteins-tolerances and the development and development of the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the recent clinical experience is the normal daily dose of Natriumphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in Herangrowing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early lack of Carbamylphosphorynthetase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, is the substitution of citanlin or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosuccinatsynthetase lack must Arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be extended patients with sluckdysfunctions, since a risk for the emergence of Ösophagussionists where tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2,5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be projected in patients with conventional Hercinante or serious kidney disease, as well as with sodium of soretention, and oil education intracted states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolic and retirement of sodium phenylbutyrat on the liver and the kidneys, should AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney disease only be used with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contrazed (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subtle gift of phenylacetate at young vines (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal propagation and an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delusion of cerebrals synapses and a decreased number of functional Nervenendings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be established whether phenylacetate is in humans into the mother's milk, and for this reason is the use of AMMONAPS during the nursing time (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trial with AMMONAPS stood at 56% of patients at least an unwanted event (AE) and for 78% of these undesirable events have gone out that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 years old anorectic patient, severe hypokaline, panzytopia, periphans Neuropathy and Pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose came with a 5 month old toddler over a 5 month old toddler of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate that showed up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosing neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection that is used by acetyelling with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is left over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometric is seen Phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both connections contain 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers of insufficient nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of urinary system can be accepted that for all grams are sodium sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the excess of survival and clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early symptoms of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn phases was almost always infant, and the disease led to treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids inside the first life year to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through Häberalysis, the utilization of alternative paths of the nitric butterflies (Natriumphenylacetate), protested reduction, and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of reconciliation at postparties (but within the first life of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients who were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and were treated before the first appearance of a hyperammonish spongiform encephalopathy, but even in these patients, it was with time for many of mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-est form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygintranscary (defect), which were treated by a hyperammonish transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and a protest diet was treated with the survival rate 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are also very reversible for treatment and with some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological giveness.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxided leads to phenylacetate which is used in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic in plasma and urine were determined by sober of 5 g of sodium of sodium of sodium of sodium as well as repetitive gifts of up to 20 g / day. (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic has also been studied with cancers according to intraventies of Natriumphenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form were 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic centralised by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cylinders or hamoglobinopathien (300-650 mg / kg / Day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning after coming fasting no phenylacetate in Plasma.</seg>

<seg id="2848">Retirement The drug is transported within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of conjured musylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus-tests, Natriumphenylbutyrat with toxic and non-toxic dosages (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 up to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granulat is either taken orally (infants and children who do not have any tablets, or patients with sluckdysfunctions) or via a Gastrostomieschl or a rhingen Sensor.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the recent clinical experience is the normal daily dose of Natriumphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at newborn baby, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in Herangrowing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, ginine, essential amino acids (especially enchcoquette amino acids), carnitine and serumproteins in plasma should be kept inside the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early lack of Carbamylphosphorynthetase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, is the substitution of citanlin or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granulat contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, accordingly 2,5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If Rattentions was suspended before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolit by phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramids of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from a 18 years old anorectic patient, severe hypokaline, panzytopia, periphans Neuropathy and Pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometric is seen Phenylacetylglutamine with urea comparable (both connections contain 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carriers for retirement of surplus value.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the retirement of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of urinary cycle. it can be accepted for any grams of soyumphenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological defects must be hardly reversible, and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological giveness.</seg>

<seg id="2966">Apidra is subkutan (under the skin) into the abdominal, the waschenkel or the upper arm injected or as lengthinfusion with an insulinpumpump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is an illness when the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose control (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulinglulisin differs very slight of humaninsulin, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter effect is considered a short-effective humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apple idra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body cannot be insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with young children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, when the body insulin not effective, apidra was investigated in a study with many adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indexed to the effectiveness was the amendment of the concentration of the substance glycoylized herb. (HbA1c) in the blood, which shows how good of bloodds is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type-1 diabetes, after six months a reduction of 0,14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at Insulinlispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In case of adults with type-2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration 0,46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% in humane standards.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apple idra should not be applied in patients, which may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against Insulinglulisin or one of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The cans of Apidra you may need to be adjusted when it is going along with a number of other medicines that can impact on the blood boxes.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004, the European Commission called the Sanofi-AvingDeutschland GmbH. a permit for the transport of Apidra in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apple idra is known as subkutane injection either in the area of the abdomen, of the torch or of the Deltamuskels, or submitting by continuous infusion on the area of the abdomination for appliences.</seg>

<seg id="2979">Any change of the effect, the brand (Her- performer), the Insulintyps (normal, NPH, zinkdelay, etc.), the type of insulins (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulphs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or the outbreak of a treatment, in particular in patients with an insult-age diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemie and a diabetic ketoaziax; these states are potential life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another Insulintyp or an insulin another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and may make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemie depends on the effects of the used Insuline and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment process.</seg>

<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that on subutaner Gaillation of Insulinglulisin the impact occurs faster and the effect of shorter than at huberinsulin Normalinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes mtus and Insulinglulisin in the therapeutic process of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg a wide gap of gluing effects, and at 0,3 E / kg or more a disproportion of the gluing effect, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulinglulisin has a twice as fast impact as normal human insulin and generates the full gluing effect about 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was apparent that at an application of Insulinglulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postponed glycaemic control will be reached as with humanem Normalinsulin, which is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
